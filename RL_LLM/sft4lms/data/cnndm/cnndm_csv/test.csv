"Jose Mourinho believes that the Ballon d’or, the trophy awarded to the world’s best footballer, should be scrapped. The Chelsea manager has sided with Arsene Wenger in calling into the question the legitimacy of the award. Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo is the current holder of the trophy which is voted for by national team managers and captains. Jose Mourinho, pictured on the Chelsea bench during their win against Stoke, has sided with Arsene Wenger . Cristiano Ronaldo, winner of the Ballon d'Or on three occasions, is presented with last year's award . Lionel Messi, who finished runner-up to Ronaldo in 2014, has previously won the compeition three times . Speaking last year, Wenger said he was ‘totally against’ the Ballon d’Or, and in a wide-ranging interview with the Telegraph, Mourinho moved to side with his great Premier League rival. ‘I think Wenger said something that is interesting; he is against the Ballon d’Or, and I think he’s right, because in this moment football is losing a little bit the concept of the team to focus more on the individual,’ said Mourinho. ‘We are always looking at the individual performance, the individual stat, the player that runs more. Because you run 11km in a game and I run nine you did a better job than I did? Maybe not! Maybe my 9km were more important than your 11.’ Arsene Wenger and Mourinho have clashed on a number of occasions during their managerial careers . Eden Hazard is congratulated by his Chelsea team-mates after scoring in their victory against Stoke City . Ronaldo beat Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer, of Bayern Munich, to this year’s award which was presented to the former Manchester United star in December. It is the third time he has been honoured with the gong. The second of his triumphs came when he was playing under Mourinho at Madrid. ‘For me, football is collective,' added Mourinho, whose Chelsea team travel to Loftus Road on Sunday as they bid to be crowned Premier League champions. 'The individual is welcome if you want to make our group better. But you have to work for us, not we have to work for you. 'When the top player arrives, the team is already there. It’s not him who comes to discover the team, like Columbus discovering America. No, no, you are coming now to help us be better. And as a manager you have to give this message every day.'","Arsene Wenger called for the competition to be scrapped last year .

"A cake-making prodigy is set to be the next Mary Berry as she prepares to publish her second cookbook. Amy-Beth Ellice, 17, from Essex started baking at the age of three and landed her first book deal with her recipe collection Amy's Baking Year at just 14. Her second, all about entertaining, is now firmly in the works but the teenager has her sights set even higher - with plans to launch her own baking products and even become a TV chef. Already baking at five years old Amy-Beth (left) is pictured with sister Lara-Jayne, 10 . Amy-Beth started baking at three-years-old and published her first cookbook, Amy's Baking Year, at age 13 . Amy-Beth most recently hosted a cupcake-making class in Harrods, London. Britain's youngest published baker, who counts Pixie Lott and Katherine Jenkins among her fans, delighted a crowd with her recent demonstration. She then signed copies of her debut cookbook in the Toy Kingdom department for thrilled shoppers. Amy-Beth also has a regular column in OK! magazine and continues to supply other publications with tips and recipes. The keen cook, who attends Newhall School in Chelmsford full-time, makes bespoke baked goods to order in her spare time, during summer holidays and half term. But it seems the talented young baker gets it all from her mother Gillian, who taught Amy and her other daughter Lara-Jayne, 22, how to make cakes. Amy gets decorating as she shows onlookers how to perfect cupcakes at a London presentation . The young cook pictured with fans at her Harrods book signing and cupcake masterclass . Amy picked up a particular knack for baking and continued to experiment until she soon took full control of the kitchen and the entertaining. Gillian told MailOline: 'When she was little Amy showed an interest and passion, as I did when I was a child, in cooking and baking. 'She watched me cook all meals and bake birthday cakes for many members of our family from scratch. 'I always preferred to make my own cakes as I knew exactly what was going in them, they tasted nicer and they were (and still are) much appreciated. 'Amy soon wanted to venture out on her own and at aged 12 she asked if she could bake her sister Lara-Jayne's cake for her 17th birthday. 'I had planned a simple chocolate sponge cake but Amy, being more adventurous, single-handedly created a two-tiered cake covered in roll-out fondant icing. 'She then decorated it with heart shaped biscuits on sticks, which later became a recipe in her book (lollipop biscuits). 'She has quite literally surpassed me in the kitchen, a fact that I'm both proud and amazed at. 'It is sometimes hard to get into the kitchen now as Amy is often experimenting with recipes, baking for charity cake sales, or helping preparing for a party or event we are organising.' Her inventive bakes are remarkable for her age. Amy designed and made a pony-themed cake for a teacher at age 12. At age 14 she was commissioned by another teacher to make a three-tiered lace effect wedding cake. She finally baked it in chocolate at age 16 using carrot, pineapple and lemon flavours. A mini oven at Christmas could certainly have helped ignite Amy's passion for cake making . When she was little Amy showed an interest and passion in cooking and baking . Amy launched a cupcake and cake business at age 13 with the help of her mother, as they both thought they could make better cakes than what was already out there. The teenager said: 'I made cupcakes for regular clients as well as celebrity functions and after parties and it grew from there. 'After having seven of my recipes published in a national newspaper weekend supplements, I approached a few publishers with a mock-up of the ideas I had for my book and got the book deal at age 14.' Her book, Amy's Baking Year, features recipes themed around the four seasons and occasions such as for Mother's Day, Easter, Halloween and Christmas. Amy launched a cupcake and cake business at age 13 with the help of her mother Gillian, as they both thought they could make better cakes than what was already out there . This catapulted Amy into the limelight of the baking world and opened up multiple doors for her . From cute cupcakes, French macarons, cookies, tarts and classic sponge cakes, to sticky puddings, jams and gingerbread - plus Amy's highly sought after 'perfect cupcake' recipe - there is an indulgent treat to suit every occasion. With a focus on family, the recipes are designed for both seasoned bakers and young enthusiasts. Amy's Baking Year features Amy's selected easy-to-follow recipes themed around the four seasons . The beautifully illustrated book also features tips on the perfect decoration and setting for each bake. She says: 'I have been brought up cooking and baking by my mum who is also a talented home cook and baker, as were her parents who both worked in catering.' A few of the recipes in the book such as my Grandad's Coconut Ice, and Aunty Lynn's Fudge have been passed down to Amy from members of her family. She continues: 'While I was at home experimenting with recipes my friends were spending their time on social media. 'It was something that I was passionate about so really enjoyed spending my time focusing on it. 'I think it's important that we return to traditional values and that what I try to get across through my cooking. 'The art of cooking and eating healthily is important to me, so I'm very conscious of the ingredients I cook with, but I think we're becoming too calorie obsessed. That being said I try not to eat everything I bake.' She is juggling her lucrative cooking career around studying for her A-levels in English literature, art and music. 'The school I attend doesn't offer cookery as an A Level. I hope to go on to train at Le Cordon Bleu in the future after I have finished school.' Amy says she hopes to have her next cookbook themed around entertaining on bookshelves nationwide by 2017.","Amy-Beth Ellice, 17, from Essex started baking at three years old .

John Terry has captained Chelsea whenever Mourinho has been in charge at the club . Centre back - Lucio . The Brazilian beast was one of the fiercest defenders of the past decade, winning everything in the game at club and international level.

Attacking midfield - Wesley Sneijder . Under Mourinho, Sneijder emerged as one of the best attacking midfielders in the world.
