The report provides an analysis of the Tildeb malware implant leaked by the Shadow Brokers. Tildeb is a console-based Windows executable compiled in 2000 that accepts command-line arguments. It has no encryption, anti-debugging or persistence mechanisms. Tildeb establishes encrypted TCP communications with a hardcoded command and control server to receive control commands. It can upload and delete files, get directory listings, modify the registry, communicate via mailslots, and inject code into the Exchange Server processes. The implant creates a cleanup thread to remove artifacts if connections fail. It attempts privilege escalation against specific Windows versions using a win32k.sys vulnerability. Tildeb tailors some actions based on the infected system's locale. The report examines Tildeb's command and control communications in depth, including the key exchange, control commands supported, error reporting, and mailslot messaging formats. It analyzes the process hollowing code injection technique employed. There are indications Tildeb may be delivered via spearphishing or run in conjunction with an exploitation framework. The compile timestamp suggests development prior to 2000, but it may have undergone iterations. While the exact targets are unknown, the Exchange Server interactions imply compromise of email environments.
