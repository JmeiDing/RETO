Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF: The report describes an online credit card skimming attack known as Magecart affecting over 3,000 online shops hosted by e-commerce provider Volusion. Attackers injected malicious code into a JavaScript library used by Volusion customers. The injected code loads a skimmer script from Google Cloud Storage that captures payment information submitted in online checkout forms. The skimmer exfiltrates the stolen card data to a domain mimicking Volusion's infrastructure. Analysis of the skimmer code and tactics indicates the attack was likely conducted by the FIN6 threat group, also known as Magecart Group 6. Similarities were found with skimmers used in FIN6 attacks against British Airways and Newegg. The skimmer uses obfuscation and blends into normal payment processing code to avoid detection. It stores stolen data in session storage before sending it via POST request to the exfiltration server when the payment form loads again. The attack demonstrates sophisticated techniques by a cybercriminal group to mass compromise online merchants through their e-commerce provider. Regular security checks, robust authentication, proper network segmentation, and threat monitoring solutions can help defend against such attacks.
