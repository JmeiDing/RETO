The document discusses recent activity from the Winnti cyber threat group, which has been active since around 2010 and primarily targets online gaming organizations and certificate authorities. Researchers at ProtectWise observed Winnti utilizing new tactics, including the use of open source hacking tools like Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) and Metasploit. The group has also expanded their targeting to deliver malware to macOS systems. The current campaign begins with spear phishing emails containing links to fake resumes. These resume pages contain scripts that load BeEF to exploit the visiting victim. C2 servers are hosted on ports like 53 and 8000 to avoid detection. Winnti continues relying on stolen digital certificates from gaming studios to sign their malware, though they may be compromising new targets. A variety of domains, IPs, and hashes are provided as indicators of compromise for this new activity. In summary, the PDF shows how Winnti has evolved their tactics to leverage open source tools, expanded to macOS malware, and is actively conducting new spear phishing campaigns. Their persistence and novel techniques like certificate theft demonstrate this threat actor's sophistication.
