The document analyzes the MedusaLocker ransomware which first emerged in September 2019 and has targeted organizations across industries, including healthcare. MedusaLocker uses various techniques to maximize chances of successful encryption: Restarts machine in safe mode to avoid security products. Avoids encrypting executables to maintain system operability. Uses AES and RSA-2048 encryption. Threatens data leak extortion in ransom notes It uses a batch script and PowerShell loader to gain persistence and elevation. It terminates processes and disables services of security products. It deletes backups and shadow copies to prevent recovery. After infecting a system, it scans the subnet for other machines and shares to propagate. The ransomware avoids encrypting certain whitelist folders. It leaves a ransom note threatening data leak extortion but no exfiltration was observed. Detection and prevention of the ransomware is demonstrated using Cybereason's Anti-Ransomware feature and Powershell protection. The Mitre ATT&CK framework is used to map the ransomware's tactics. Indicators of Compromise and hashes for the ransomware executables, batch script, and PowerShell loader are provided. The threat level is assessed as high due to the ransomware's destructive potential.
