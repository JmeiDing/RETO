The document describes a new data wiper malware called CryWiper that has been used in attacks against Russian organizations, including mayor's offices and courts. CryWiper was first discovered by Kaspersky in fall 2022 being used against a Russian entity. CryWiper masquerades as ransomware but is actually designed to permanently destroy data beyond recovery. It creates scheduled tasks to repeatedly run on compromised systems. It contacts a command and control server which can remotely activate the wiping process. CryWiper stops critical database and email services, deletes shadow copies, and modifies the registry to prevent remote access. It then corrupts files on the system while skipping certain directories and file types to avoid fully disabling the computer. After wiping files, it generates a fake ransom note demanding payment in Bitcoin to decrypt files, even though restoration is not possible. The wiping uses an algorithm called Mersenne Twister, distinct from other 2022 wipers like IsaacWiper. While not true ransomware, CryWiper can still cause severe data destruction and business disruption. It does not appear related to major 2022 wipers like WhisperGate and AcidRain that targeted Ukraine. CryWiper has been deployed against Russian entities, marking a change from wipers focused on Ukraine. In summary, CryWiper is a destructive new data wiper used in attacks on Russian mayor's offices and courts, masquerading as ransomware while making reliable data recovery impossible.
