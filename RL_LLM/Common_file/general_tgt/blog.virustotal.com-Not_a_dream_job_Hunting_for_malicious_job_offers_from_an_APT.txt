The PDF describes research by VirusTotal into a malicious job offer scheme attributed to a North Korean threat actor group called UNC4034. It expands on recent reporting of this activity by Mandiant. The original publication provides two hashes of ISO files named amazon_test.iso and amazon_assessment.iso, but only the first one was found in VirusTotal. The new sample seems to be the new variant with a different configuration, also in a Readme.txt file. Both ISO files contain two files inside them - a Windows executable (apparently a poisoned version of Putty) and Readme.txt. The actor sends victims job offers for major companies like Amazon via email and WhatsApp, containing ISO files pretending to be part of the hiring process. The ISO files contain malware posing as remote access tools like PuTTY. VirusTotal found additional related ISO samples beyond what Mandiant reported by pivoting on metadata like volume names. The new samples target other companies like IBM and Dell. IP addresses and PDB strings provide insights into the attacker's infrastructure. The PDF provides the technical methodology VirusTotal used to uncover more ISO malware samples related to this campaign. It demonstrates how defenders can leverage VirusTotal to hunt for new activity associated with reported threat actor operations. The research expands the known scope of this North Korean malicious job offer scheme.
