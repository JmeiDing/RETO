The report provides an in-depth analysis of WastedLocker, a new ransomware variant used in attacks since May 2020. WastedLocker is attributed to the prolific Evil Corp cybercrime group, previously known for Dridex malware and BitPaymer ransomware. The attacks typically start with the SocGholish malware framework distributing a custom Cobalt Strike loader for lateral movement. WastedLocker is then deployed across the network to encrypt files and demand ransom. The ransomware is protected by the CryptOne crypter service and generates a victim-specific executable. Technical details are provided on WastedLocker's encryption routine, command line parameters, string encryption, and process injection techniques. The ransom note structure and contents are also analyzed. A decrypter was found that can recover files. The report suggests the emergence of WastedLocker is part of an Evil Corp rebranding effort to distance themselves from individuals indicted in December 2019. Infrastructure and TTP changes have occurred, but the group remains active and dangerous. Attacks have focused on major corporations in the US and Europe. Extensive indicators of compromise are listed, including Cobalt Strike servers, WastedLocker samples, and the SocGholish malware framework. Recommendations focus on detecting the initial infection vector and lateral movement stages. The report aims to provide insight into the group's latest tools and methods to improve defenses against targeted ransomware campaigns.
