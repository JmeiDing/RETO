The PDF describes an analysis of a sophisticated cyberespionage operation called PZCHAO that has been active in Asia and the US. The attackers use targeted spam messages containing malware to compromise victims. The initial malware then fetches additional payloads from a command and control infrastructure. The payloads include a Bitcoin miner, Mimikatz password stealer, and a remote access trojan called Gh0st RAT. Gh0st RAT appears to be a modified version of the tool used previously by a threat actor known as Iron Tiger APT. The command and control infrastructure uses multiple subdomains with specialized roles like download, upload, and RAT communications. The network traffic is encrypted. The downloaded tools also connect back to the infrastructure for control. The attackers appear to be focused on government, technology, education, and telecommunications sectors. The tools enable extensive surveillance of victims through capabilities like keylogging, webcam access, and remote shell. While the tools are a few years old, they remain effective for espionage. The attackers constantly modify them to evade defenses. The report provides indicators of compromise and other technical details on the malware for detection and prevention. In summary, PZCHAO is a sophisticated, ongoing cyberespionage operation enabling surveillance against strategic targets in Asia using custom malware and infrastructure. The attackers are adept at modifying their tools to avoid detection.
