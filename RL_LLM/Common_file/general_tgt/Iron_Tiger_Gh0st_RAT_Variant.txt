The PDF describes analysis of a malicious toolkit used by a threat actor group called Iron Tiger. The malware uses a modified version of the Gh0st remote access trojan (RAT). When executed, it drops install scripts and a cabinet file containing encrypted shellcode and a DLL. The shellcode decrypts itself and loads plugins from the attacker. The malware has two main tools - 'Noodles' which is an old version of Gh0st RAT, and 'Mozilla' which is the primary RAT used in this campaign. Mozilla can communicate over SSL or TCP, supports loading plugins from the attacker, and its code suggests it is still in development. The malware functionality relies heavily on plugins, which are based on Gh0st RAT code. The plugins provide capabilities like command execution, file transfer, screenshots, credential theft, etc. Network traffic is encrypted using RC4 with a per-message key. The researchers wrote a script to decrypt captured traffic, which reveals exchanged data like the victim machine name and transferred plugins. The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, C2 IPs, service names, and registry keys. It refers to previous reporting on Iron Tiger by Bitdefender and Trend Micro. The malware does not demonstrate sophisticated capabilities, with a main focus on cryptocurrency mining. The report aims to document the custom Gh0st RAT variant used by this group.
