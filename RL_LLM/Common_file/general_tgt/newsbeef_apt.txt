The PDF describes cyber activity by a threat actor referred to as NewsBeef or APT33. NewsBeef has focused on targeting Saudi Arabian and Western organizations and individuals. In 2016-2017, NewsBeef deployed a new toolset moving away from their previous reliance on the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF). The new tools included macro-enabled Office documents, PowerSploit scripts, and the Pupy backdoor. The group uses spearphishing emails, social media links, and compromised websites to deliver the malicious tools. They compromised several Saudi government and business websites to inject JavaScript that tracked and redirected visitors. The macro documents deliver PowerShell scripts that download poisoned software installers like Flash and Chrome. These installers execute PowerSploit scripts and Pupy. Pupy communicates over Tor and allows the attackers to run modules and access the infected system. While the group previously lacked advanced skills, the recent campaigns show an increase in technical capabilities in areas like JavaScript injection, obfuscation, and evading detection. However they still rely on some old infrastructure and open-source tools. NewsBeef continues to rely heavily on social engineering focused on targets in Saudi Arabia and Europe. The report predicts the group's activities will continue and expand. It recommends security teams in Saudi Arabia prioritize updating web applications and plugins that are being targeted.
