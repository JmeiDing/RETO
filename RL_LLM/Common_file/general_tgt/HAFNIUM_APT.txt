The PDF describes attacks by a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor named HAFNIUM targeting on-premises Microsoft Exchange Servers. HAFNIUM exploited multiple 0-day vulnerabilities to gain initial access and install web shells for long-term persistence. The vulnerabilities exploited were CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065. Microsoft released patches and urged customers to update Exchange Servers immediately. Once compromised, HAFNIUM used tools like Procdump and PowerCat to dump credentials, download additional payloads, and exfiltrate data. They focused on entities in the US across sectors like infectious disease and law firms. Indicators of compromise and detection guidance are provided, including Exchange server logs to analyze, antivirus detections, and advanced hunting queries. The report aims to help security teams investigate potential compromise and defend against HAFNIUM. In summary, the PDF provides technical details on zero-day exploits used by HAFNIUM to compromise on-premises Exchange Servers and entrench access. It equips defenders with specific IOCs and detections to enable investigation and response.
