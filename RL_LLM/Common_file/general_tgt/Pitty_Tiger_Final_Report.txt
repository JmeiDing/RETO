The report details an investigation into a group of cyber attackers known as "Pitty Tiger." Pitty Tiger has been active since at least 2011 and conducts cyber espionage campaigns targeting private companies and at least one government entity. The report provides an overview of Pitty Tiger's tactics, techniques, and procedures, which follow the standard steps of an APT (advanced persistent threat) attack - reconnaissance, initial compromise, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. Pitty Tiger relies heavily on spear phishing to gain initial access and uses custom remote access tools like PittyTiger RAT and CT RAT along with modified versions of known RATs like Gh0stRAT. The report analyzes Pitty Tiger's infrastructure, including domains like avstore.com.tw and skypetm.com.tw, and identifies victims across various industries in Europe. It also profiles individual attackers like "Toot" and malware developers "Cold & Snow." While Pitty Tiger does not appear to be a state-sponsored group, they sell their services to private companies likely seeking advantages over competitors. The group is small but effective, though lacks sophistication compared to other APT groups. The report concludes with indicators of compromise and other technical details to help detect Pitty Tiger activity.
