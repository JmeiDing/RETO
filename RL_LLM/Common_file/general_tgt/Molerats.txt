The PDF describes a new cyberespionage operation targeting Android users in the Middle East region. Researchers discovered a spyware app called Welcome Chat being promoted as a secure messaging app, but it actually steals extensive data from victims. Welcome Chat was distributed outside the Google Play store via a website in Arabic. It requests intrusive permissions needed for it to function as a chat app. But it also covertly exfiltrates SMS messages, call logs, contacts, photos, recordings, location, and other data to its command and control server. Analysis indicates Welcome Chat was likely built fully malicious, not by trojanizing a legitimate chat app. Its code was copied from various open source projects. Collected data was found freely available on an unsecured server. Links were found between Welcome Chat and a years-long espionage campaign in the Middle East called BadPatch, tied to the threat actor Molerats/Gaza Hackers. The spyware used the same command and control infrastructure. The report concludes users should avoid sideloading apps from outside official app stores to avoid this type of spyware. Technical details like hashes and ATT&CK techniques are provided to detect Welcome Chat. Users should be wary of chat apps requesting excessive permissions.
