Asruex malware is distributed via malicious shortcut files sent in spearphishing emails. When opened, the shortcut runs a PowerShell command to download and execute a malware downloader. The downloader fetches an image file from a C2 server which contains encrypted Asruex. It decodes and executes Asruex malware. The downloader may contain an encoded executable file of Process Hacker (a multi-function task manager) and it may execute the Process Hacker if an anti-virus software is detected. Asruex operates based on configuration information stored in itself, which includes C&C servers and dummy hosts that it connects to, version information, and a key to decode data which is delivered. The configuration information is encoded and can be decoded with Python code. Asruex executes commands received from the C&C server, such as collecting information about infected hosts, obtaining process list, obtaining file list, changing waiting time, obtaining version information, uninstalling, obtaining folder list, loading DLL, executing external DLL (AdvProv.dll), downloading and executing a file, copying a file, changing a file name, changing file time, deleting a file, terminating a process, searching a registry, showing a registry entry, creating a registry entry, showing another registry entry, and deleting another registry entry. Asruex is associated with threat actor DarkHotel and has been seen targeting organizations since around October 2015. IOCs, decoding methods, and analysis of the malware's capabilities are provided. Hosts Asruex connects to should be blocked.
