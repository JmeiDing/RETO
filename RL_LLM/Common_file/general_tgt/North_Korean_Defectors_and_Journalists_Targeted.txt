The report describes a targeted malware campaign against North Korean defectors and journalists in South Korea. Attackers sent links via KakaoTalk, Facebook, and email to get victims to download malicious Android apps. Two dropper apps were seen - one disguised as a prayer app and one as a healthcare app. The droppers check if the device is already infected, trick the user into granting accessibility permissions, then install a spyware Trojan. The Trojan uses cloud storage services like Dropbox and Yandex for command and control. It gathers device info, downloads commands, and can exfiltrate data like SMS, contacts, and KakaoTalk chats. Variants were found that use different cloud services or drop additional malware. The attackers seem highly familiar with Korean culture and language. The report ties the activity to a group they call Sun Team based on connected social media accounts used to spread the malware. The campaign targets North Korean defectors, journalists, and groups who help defectors. The attackers' methods demonstrate how malware can be spread through social engineering on chat apps, social media, and email.
