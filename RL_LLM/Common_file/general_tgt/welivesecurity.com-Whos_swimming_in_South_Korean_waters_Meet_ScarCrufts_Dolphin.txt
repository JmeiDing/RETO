The PDF describes a sophisticated backdoor malware named Dolphin used by the ScarCruft APT group (also known as APT37 or Reaper). ScarCruft primarily targets South Korea and is interested in government, military, and companies linked to North Korean interests. In early 2021, ScarCruft conducted a watering hole attack on a South Korean online newspaper, exploiting Internet Explorer to deploy a backdoor called BLUELIGHT. ESET researchers discovered that BLUELIGHT then deployed a more advanced backdoor, Dolphin, on selected victims. Dolphin has extensive spying capabilities including monitoring drives, exfiltrating files, keylogging, stealing browser credentials, and taking screenshots. It uses Google Drive for command and control. Notable features include modifying victim's Google account settings to enable IMAP and lower security, likely to maintain access to the email inbox. Earlier versions could also directly steal credentials from browsers like Chrome, Edge, and IE. ESET observed continued development of Dolphin across multiple versions, improving capabilities and evasion attempts. Changes include using dynamic API resolution, removing then restoring credential theft, encoding strings, and reorganizing code. In summary, Dolphin is a sophisticated and continuously developed backdoor used selectively by ScarCruft after initial compromise, providing extensive spying capabilities leveraging cloud services. Its ability to modify Google account settings to maintain email access highlights the group's interest in long-term monitoring of key individuals.
