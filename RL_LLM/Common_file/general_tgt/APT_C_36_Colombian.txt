The document, APT_C_36_Colombian.pdf, is a report on a continuous attack targeting Colombian government institutions and corporations. The attacker uses various tactics such as masquerading as the Tax and Customs Administration to target companies with international trade, disguising as the judiciary and immigration authorities against banks and multinational corporation branches located in Colombia, and using proxy and VPN to hide IP addresses. Spearphishing emails containing password protected RAR files are sent to targets. The RAR contains a malicious MHTML document that drops a trojan when macros are enabled. The trojan is a variant of Imminent Monitor RAT which can remotely control the infected system. The email attachment is encrypted and stored in the compressed package, and a decryption password is provided in the mail body to bypass security detection of the email gateway. After analyzing the mail, it was found that the attacker uses approaches such as proxy and VPN to hide its IP address when sending emails.
