The document analyzes the tactics, techniques, and procedures of an advanced persistent threat (APT) group dubbed Earth Berberoka that targets online gambling sites. Earth Berberoka uses both new and old malware to infect Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. This includes a new complex malware PuppetLoader, as well as upgraded versions of known malware like PlugX, Gh0stRAT, and Xnote. The group has a large infrastructure and uses distributed teams with specialized roles. It can manage attacks from start to finish, conducting reconnaissance, gaining initial access, moving laterally, and deploying ransomware. Earth Berberoka uses clever social engineering like a fake secure chat app to distribute malware. It also exploits vulnerabilities to inject code that redirects victims to malware under the guise of a Flash Player update. Victimology and decrypted configurations point to a focus on Chinese-language gambling sites. Potential links are drawn to other Chinese-speaking threat actors based on tactics, code similarities, and certificates. The report provides technical analysis of the group's malware, infrastructure, and operations. It aims to inform defenses against sophisticated, coordinated attacks that leverage a range of old and new tools.
