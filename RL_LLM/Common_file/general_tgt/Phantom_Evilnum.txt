The PDF describes a new malware campaign dubbed "Phantom in the Command Shell" targeting the financial sector. The malware, called EVILNUM, uses decoy image files that when opened deploy a Javascript agent to compromise the system. The infection starts when victims receive links to compressed archives hosted on Google Drive containing shortcut files masquerading as JPEGs or PDFs. When opened, these shortcuts run a command to extract and execute a Javascript agent. The agent gathers system info and checks for antivirus software. It retrieves its C2 server from hidden web pages on GitLab and DigitalPoint and communicates via HTTP. It can upload/download files, run commands, harvest cookies, and run scripts. The agent persists by adding registry run keys. It also modifies the registry to weaken security settings in Internet Explorer and disable certain antivirus protections. This campaign uses version 3.6 and 4.0 of the EVILNUM malware, adding new techniques like querying different C2s based on antivirus presence. The group continues to target financial organizations worldwide. Defensive recommendations include disabling Microsoft shortcuts, segmenting high-risk systems, and monitoring for connections to attacker infrastructure. Technical details on indicators of compromise are provided.
