The document describes an investigation by Google and White Ops into a major online ad fraud operation called "3ve" that was taken down through industry collaboration. - 3ve was composed of three sophisticated botnets that each used different techniques to commit ad fraud at a massive scale, generating billions of fraudulent ad bid requests. - The botnets infected over 1 million IPs from residential computers and corporate networks to proxy their activities. They created over 10,000 counterfeit websites mimicking legitimate publishers to sell fake ad inventory. - 3ve.1 used malware infections and BGP hijacking to acquire proxy IPs. 3ve.2 infected 700,000 computers via malvertising to power a custom browsing botnet. 3ve.3 used IP addresses from data centers. - The botnets used advanced techniques to mimic human behavior and evade detection like fake mouse movements, randomized behaviors, anti-forensics scans, and blockchain mining scripts. - Google, White Ops and other security firms analyzed the operation and formed an industry working group. They observed the operators, mapped the infrastructure, and coordinated a takedown. - The takedown involved referral to law enforcement, infrastructure disruption, botnet sinkholing, and cooperation across ad tech, security firms, ISPs and hosting providers. It successfully rendered the 3ve botnets inactive. - The collaboration and actions taken aim to set a precedent to deter future large-scale ad fraud operations by imposing real consequences on the perpetrators. Continued industry cooperation is needed to protect the digital ad ecosystem.
