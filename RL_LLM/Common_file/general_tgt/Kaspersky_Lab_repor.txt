The report describes the structure and operations of Russian-language cybercriminal groups that engage in financial cybercrime. It notes that financial cybercrime has become very common among Russian-speaking hackers, with over 160 arrests made globally from 2012-2015. The cybercriminal market provides various "products" like malware and "services" like spam distribution that enable four main types of cybercrime: DDoS attacks, theft of personal/financial data, direct theft of money, and corporate espionage. Currently, direct theft of money is the most widespread. The cybercriminal labor market includes programmers, testers, web designers, distributors, hackers, system admins, call services, money flow managers, mule project leaders, and organizers. Roles can be staff positions or contracted. Cybercriminal groups come in different sizes. Affiliate programs distribute their tools to individual "affiliates" who execute attacks. Small groups of <10 use ready-made tools. Large groups of 10+ create custom tools and resemble a legitimate software company in structure. Attacks typically have phases like initial exploration of the target, infecting victim computers, exploring the network, and finally stealing money by initiating fraudulent transfers or using stolen payment cards. Different team members execute each phase. The report concludes that cybercriminals benefit from ineffective legislation, lack of law enforcement staffing, and poor international cooperation. Kaspersky Lab aims to support investigations and terminate cybercriminal groups through expert analysis.
