Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF document: The document analyzes cyberespionage campaigns conducted by a threat actor group called IndigoZebra, attributed to China, targeting Central Asia since 2014. IndigoZebra sent spearphishing emails to government agencies in Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. The emails contained password-protected RAR archives with weaponized documents that dropped a custom backdoor called xCaon if opened. xCaon had HTTP and Dropbox variants for command and control. The Dropbox version named BoxCaon used unique folders in Dropbox accounts to send commands and exfiltrate data. xCaon used various techniques for stealth like checking for security software, stackstrings obfuscation, and encrypting C2 traffic. It could run commands, upload/download files, and fingerprint systems. IndigoZebra registered lookalike domains imitating government sites for C2 servers. Infrastructure analysis revealed domains clustered on certain hosting providers over time. Campaigns expanded from targeting former Soviet states to Afghanistan in 2021. Attacks were precisely targeted with custom malware, tactics tailored to specific organizations. In summary, IndigoZebra conducted long-running, evolving cyberespionage campaigns against Central Asia by compromising government agencies with custom malware like xCaon for stealthy C2 and data theft. The group is adaptable, expanding infrastructure and targets over time.
