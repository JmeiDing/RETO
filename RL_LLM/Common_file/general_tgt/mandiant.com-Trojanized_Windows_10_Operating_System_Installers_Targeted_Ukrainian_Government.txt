The document discusses threat activity tracked as UNC4166 targeting the Ukrainian government through trojanized Windows 10 installers distributed via torrent sites. The installers contained scheduled tasks that gathered system info and communicated with TOR C2 servers. If targets were deemed of interest, additional malware would be deployed for further reconnaissance and data theft, including the backdoors STOWAWAY, BEACON, and SPAREPART. SPAREPART in particular is a lightweight backdoor that generates random sleep times before beaconing to C2 infrastructure. The trojanized installers were designed to target Ukrainian users by utilizing the Ukrainian language pack. Multiple Ukrainian government organizations were compromised after installing the malware. While attribution could not be definitively made, UNC4166's targeting overlaps with previous GRU-related activity against Ukraine. The supply chain compromise and anti-detection capabilities indicate a sophisticated threat actor. Indicators of compromise and Yara rules are provided.
