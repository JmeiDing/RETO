The PDF analyzes a new malware campaign by the Vietnamese state-sponsored group APT32 targeting the Cambodian government. APT32, also known as OceanLotus, has previously conducted cyber espionage campaigns against the ASEAN economic union. The report examines two malware samples delivered via spearphishing emails containing ASEAN-themed malicious documents. The malware uses DLL side-loading techniques consistent with APT32's known tradecraft. One sample communicates with an identified APT32 command and control server that has been in contact with a Cambodian government IP address. The campaign aligns with deteriorating Vietnam-Cambodia ties as Cambodia strengthens relations with China on initiatives like Belt and Road. Technical details such as YARA rules and indicators of compromise are provided to detect this new phase of APT32 activity. The report highlights APT32's continuing focus on Southeast Asian targets, leveraging geopolitical themes in spearphishing documents and adapting tradecraft to evade detection. The targeting of Cambodia reflects Vietnam's strategic interest in its neighbor's growing relations with China through both cyber and conventional means.
