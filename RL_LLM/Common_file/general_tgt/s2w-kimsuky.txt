The report describes three new Android malware variants attributed to the North Korean threat group Kimsuky: 1. FastFire - Disguised as a Google security plugin, uses Firebase for C2 communication. Still in development. 2. FastViewer - Repackaged version of Hancom Office Viewer that steals device info. When opening specially crafted documents, it downloads FastSpy. 3. FastSpy - Remote access trojan (RAT) based on open source AndroSpy. Can take control of infected devices. FastViewer and FastSpy are signed with the same certificate and have overlapping infrastructure with previous Kimsuky campaigns. The malware aims to steal information from targets in South Korea by abusing accessibility features to bypass permissions. Kimsuky is advancing mobile targeting by using Firebase for C2 and customizing open source tools. The report provides indicators of compromise and recommendations such as not opening phishing pages or downloading files from third parties. It highlights that Kimsuky's mobile strategy is evolving and Android users should be vigilant against sophisticated attacks.
