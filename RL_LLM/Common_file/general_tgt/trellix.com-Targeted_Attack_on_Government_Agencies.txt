The Trellix Email Security team discovered a malicious campaign targeting government agencies in Afghanistan, India, Italy, Poland, and the United States since 2021. Spear phishing emails contain geopolitical lures and either a malicious attachment or link to a ZIP file containing an Excel document. When opened, a macro in the Excel file decrypts and installs a Remote Access Trojan such as AsyncRAT or LimeRAT. The RATs communicate with a command and control server to exfiltrate data and have capabilities to capture screenshots, keystrokes, credentials, and other confidential information. They can also move laterally within networks. Email headers show the campaign originating from South Asia, suggesting involvement of South Asian threat actors. The emails are sent intermittently in short bursts to avoid detection. The macro code and RAT executables exhibit multiple stages of obfuscation. Persistence is achieved by adding a Run registry key. The campaign has evolved over time in terms of lures, delivery methods, and payloads. Trellix Email Security can detect the malicious emails, documents, and macros. Indicators of compromise, mitigation advice, and ATT&CK techniques are provided. The report highlights the ongoing risk of targeted attacks against government entities using spear phishing.
