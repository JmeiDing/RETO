The document provides a detailed analysis of the cybercriminal group Silence, which conducts financially motivated attacks against banks and ATMs. Silence is a Russian-speaking group that emerged in mid-2016. They slowly developed their skills, learning from other groups before conducting their first successful thefts in late 2017. The group uses phishing emails containing weaponized Office documents to initially compromise targets. They have used various exploits like CVE-2017-0199, CVE-2017-0262, CVE-2017-11882, and CVE-2018-8174. Once inside a network, Silence uses open source tools like Mimikatz and Metasploit as well as custom malware like the Silence Trojan, ProxyBot, and Atmosphere. Atmosphere is custom malware for controlling ATM cash dispensers. It has evolved over time to improve reliability and remove unnecessary functions. Silence typically spends time gathering information about a network and operator workflows before attempting any money theft. Their custom ProxyBot tool allows them to tunnel traffic from isolated bank networks to their C2 servers. After some initial failures, Silence successfully stole over $100,000 from ATMs in October 2017. They stole over $500,000 via card processing attacks in early 2018, and another $150,000 from ATMs in April 2018. The report provides extensive technical details on Silence's custom malware, including analysis of the Silence Trojan, ProxyBot, Atmosphere, and other tools. It contains malware samples, network indicators, email addresses, and other IOCs. The report aims to provide information to help security teams detect and defend against attacks by this newly discovered financial threat group.
