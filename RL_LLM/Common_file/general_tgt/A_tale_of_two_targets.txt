In June 2016, ThreatConnect identified Chinese APT activity targeting two European companies - a consumer drone company and a US subsidiary of a French energy management company. The drone company was targeted using a malware variant called HttpBrowser that has been used by Chinese APTs for espionage. The command and control domain was registered to a known Chinese registrant tied to previous attacks. The targets align with previous activity by the EMISSARY PANDA APT group. The energy company has US defense contracts, allowing the espionage to potentially be categorized as military intelligence gathering. However, the drone maker appears to be a case of economic espionage, aimed at gaining competitive intelligence to benefit Chinese drone leader DJI. Theft of intellectual property and business plans could preempt the targeted company's innovations and pricing. While economic espionage may have evolved after agreements between the US and China, this case shows it likely continues in adapted forms. China may be avoiding US companies to reduce scrutiny and targeting dual-use firms that allow classification as non-economic espionage.
