Here is a summary of the key points from the Mandiant report on the Iranian state-sponsored hacking group APT42: APT42 is a prolific Iranian cyber espionage group active since at least 2015. Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence they operate on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The group relies on highly targeted spear phishing to compromise accounts and mobile devices of individuals and organizations of interest to Iran. This includes government officials, journalists, academics, and dissidents. Once compromised, APT42 has deployed Android malware capable of location tracking, recording communications, and stealing SMS messages and images. APT42 focuses on building trust with targets before sending credential harvesting links or attachments. They often impersonate journalists over weeks before acting maliciously. The group has consistently targeted Western think tanks, the Iranian diaspora, and the personal accounts of government officials. Their targeting aligns with Iranian intelligence priorities. APT42 uses a range of custom malware in operations, including backdoors, keyloggers, and Android surveillance tools. Some tools reuse code from public GitHub repositories. The report provides technical details on APT42's tactics, known malware, infrastructure, targeting, and attributes them with high confidence to the Iranian government based on strategic alignment.
