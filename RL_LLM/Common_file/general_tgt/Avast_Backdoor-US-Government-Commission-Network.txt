Avast Backdoor-US-Government-Commission-Network.pdf is a document that describes an attack on an organization by a government agency. The attackers were able to intercept and possibly exfiltrate all local network traffic in the organization, allowing them to download and run any malicious code on the infected system. The document provides analysis of two files found in the attack: a downloader and a decryptor. The downloader disguises itself as oci.dll and checks the MD5 of the hostname to stop if it doesn't match the one stored. The decryptor replaces the first file at a later stage of the attack and is similar to the one described by Trend Labs from Operation Red Signature. The NTLib works as a layer between oci.dll and WinDivert, creating a higher level interface for TCP communication. The NTLib checks for magic bytes in specific positions of the structure given as the first argument as some sort of authentication. The exported functions of NTLib include NTAccept, NTAcceptPWD, NTSend, NTReceive, NTIsClosed, NTClose, NTGetSrcAddr, NTGetDscAddr, and NTGetPwdPacket. The second file found masquerades as oci.dll and likely represents another, later stage of the same attack. It is used to decrypt and run in memory the file "SecurityHealthServer.dll".
