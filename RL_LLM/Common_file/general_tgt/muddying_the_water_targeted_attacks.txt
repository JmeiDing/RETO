The PDF discusses targeted cyberattacks in the Middle East taking place in 2017 that the researchers attribute to a group they call "MuddyWater". The attacks primarily target Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE, but have also hit surrounding nations and as far as India and USA. The attacks involve malicious Microsoft Word documents sent to victims that prompt them to enable macros, which then install a PowerShell backdoor called POWERSTATS on the target system. The group makes small tweaks to their tools and infrastructure over time but largely relies on the same basic techniques. These attacks were previously linked by some researchers to the FIN7 cybercrime group, but the researchers argue this attribution was likely incorrect. The attacks have different targeting, don't use infrastructure or malware associated with FIN7, and seem focused on espionage rather than FIN7's financial motivations. The one exception is a tool called DNSMessenger which was seen used by both groups. But the researchers posit this could be a shared tool used by multiple groups rather than definitive proof that FIN7 is behind these attacks. They say drawing accurate attribution is difficult with groups using similar publicly available tools. In summary, the PDF provides an overview of a campaign of cyber espionage attacks in the Middle East that the researchers attribute to a newly dubbed group called MuddyWater. It argues this group is distinct from the FIN7 cybercrime gang despite some questionable previous attribution.
