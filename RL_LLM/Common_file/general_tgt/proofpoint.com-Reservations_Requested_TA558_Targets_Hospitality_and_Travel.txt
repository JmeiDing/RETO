The document describes the activities of a financially-motivated cybercrime group called TA558 that has been targeting the hospitality, travel, and tourism industries since at least 2018. TA558 sends phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links to victims, typically hotels, travel agencies, and other tourism-related businesses. The emails use reservation and booking themes as lures. If victims open attachments or click links, TA558 installs remote access trojans like Loda RAT or Revenge RAT on their systems. TA558 mainly targets organizations in Latin America and Spanish/Portuguese speakers, but has expanded to Western Europe and North America over time. The group was most active in 2020, but increased attacks again in 2022. In 2022, TA558 shifted away from macro documents to using ISO and RAR files likely to bypass new Microsoft macro restrictions. The remote access trojans installed by TA558 can be used to steal sensitive customer and corporate data. They also allow lateral movement and deployment of additional malware. The group has used at least 15 different malware families over time. TA558 customizes attacks for each target, but repeatedly uses the string "CDT" in its infrastructure, possibly referring to a travel company. The group poses an ongoing threat to travel and hospitality entities globally, especially in Latin America. In summary, the document provides an overview of TA558 campaigns, tactics, infrastructure, targeting, and objectives as a financially-motivated actor that has consistently targeted the travel industry since 2018.
