The document describes two malware campaigns, referred to as Metamorfo, that targeted Brazilian users with banking trojans. In Campaign #1, emails contained HTML attachments that redirected victims to download ZIP archives from cloud storage sites. The ZIP files contained a trojanized executable that extracted and executed a malicious HTA script. This script downloaded a second stage VBS script that then retrieved the final payload - a banking trojan. The trojan captures screenshots, logs keystrokes, kills AV processes, and steals credentials when the user visits banking sites. It connects to one of several command and control servers. In Campaign #2, phishing emails redirected users to download a ZIP archive containing an AutoIt executable. This executable drops and executes a VBS script that downloads a signed Microsoft binary and a banking trojan DLL. The legit binary is used to load the trojan via DLL side-loading. This trojan also steals banking credentials and system info, displays fake update screens, and connects to C2 servers. Both campaigns demonstrate sophisticated multi-stage techniques to ultimately infect users in Brazil with malware capable of intercepting banking information. Infrastructure analysis suggests the campaigns have successfully compromised thousands of hosts.
