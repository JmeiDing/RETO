The cybersecurity company FortiGuard Labs detected a campaign by the Chinese APT group Deep Panda exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability to infect VMware Horizon servers across several countries and industries. After exploiting the servers, Deep Panda installed a backdoor called Milestone on the victim machines. Further analysis of Milestone led to the discovery of a new kernel-level rootkit signed with stolen digital certificates that had also been used by the Chinese APT Winnti. The initial infection begins with Log4Shell exploitation of VMware Horizon servers, which executes a PowerShell command to download and run scripts that install the Milestone backdoor DLL. Milestone is based on the leaked Gh0st RAT code and has capabilities like remote command execution, screenshot capture, and collecting system information. Some variants side-load the backdoor DLL using a benign executable signed by Synaptics. Investigation of related samples revealed a dropper that installs Milestone along with a kernel-level rootkit driver named crtsys.sys. The rootkit uses techniques like DKOM and filesystem filtering to hide artifacts like files, processes, registry keys, and network connections. It is digitally signed with stolen certificates from video game companies that were also used to sign Winnti tools. The tactics, techniques, and infrastructure links Milestone to the Chinese APT Deep Panda. The shared certificates and rootkit capabilities connect the campaign to Winnti as well. The opportunistic targeting of the Log4Shell vulnerability allowed the threat actors to gain access to many international organizations for espionage and data exfiltration. FortiGuard's technologies detect and block the malware at multiple stages of the infection chain.
