The document analyzes updates made by the Outlaw hacking group to their cybercrime toolkit for compromising systems to mine cryptocurrency. Outlaw had been quiet for months but increased activities in December 2019 with updated versions of their previous malware. The new version kills off competing miners and Outlaw's own old versions to maximize profits. It uses known vulnerabilities like Dirty COW to infect Linux and Unix systems, gathering system info and installing a Monero miner. Loud network scanning originates from the command server to find victims. Updated propagation methods include bundling executables, looping execution via error messages, and evasion techniques. New features target Android devices for mining. The Perl-based Shellbot backdoor allows control of infected hosts. Outlaw appears to be assessing previously compromised hosts and targeting enterprises slow to patch. Most activity was seen in the US and Europe across 456 IPs. The report analyzes Outlaw's updated tactics, tools, and procedures for infecting systems to build their crypto-mining botnet. It suggests adopting multilayered security solutions for protection. In summary, the document examines updates made by the Outlaw group to their malware toolkit for infecting more systems to mine cryptocurrency and evade detection.
