The document describes a new malware family called Reaver that has ties to an existing malware called SunOrcal. Reaver has been active since late 2016 and has 3 variants identified so far, with only 10 unique samples found. It is unique in that its final payload is a Control Panel (CPL) file, which is rarely seen in malware. Reaver variants drop the CPL payload with a hardcoded path and filename like Applet.cpl or winhelp.cpl. They also create a shortcut file in the startup folders to execute the CPL on boot. The CPL payload gathers system info like IP, OS version, CPU details etc and exfiltrates it to a command and control server. It can also receive commands to take actions like spawning processes, modifying files/registry etc. Reaver shows ties to the older SunOrcal malware in terms of timeline, infrastructure, and targeting. Both were used concurrently from late 2016 to Nov 2017. There is overlap in C2 domains and IP addresses between the two. SunOrcal has been reported to target ethnic or independence movements seen as dangerous by China, like Uyghurs, Tibetans, Falun Gong etc. This indicates Reaver may target similar groups. In summary, a new rarely seen malware Reaver has been found that has links to an existing Chinese-tied malware SunOrcal. It likely targets similar groups like pro-independence activists and has info-stealing and remote control capabilities. Security tools from Palo Alto Networks can detect and block it.
