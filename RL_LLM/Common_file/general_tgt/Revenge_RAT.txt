The report by Uptycs details a recent phishing campaign distributing the Revenge RAT malware, targeting users in Brazil. The attack starts with a weaponized Word document that fetches a remote template to bypass static detection. The template executes a malicious Excel file that contains VBA macros. The macros execute a PowerShell script hosted on a domain mimicking a legitimate Brazilian hotel chain. The script goes through multiple stages to eventually download and execute the Revenge RAT payload. Analysis of the RAT shows it collects system information to fingerprint the victim's machine. It can receive commands from the C2 server to capture screenshots, keystrokes, audio, and more. The report dives into the technical analysis of each stage of the attack chain, including the various scripts and payloads. It outlines the RAT's configuration, network communication, command handling, and capabilities. It also covers how Uptycs EDR is able to detect this threat by decoding obfuscated PowerShell and analyzing behaviors. IOCs and Yara rules are provided to identify this campaign. Overall, the report gives in-depth insight into how the attackers leveraged multiple stages of scripts and macro-enabled Office documents to distribute the RAT while evading detection.
