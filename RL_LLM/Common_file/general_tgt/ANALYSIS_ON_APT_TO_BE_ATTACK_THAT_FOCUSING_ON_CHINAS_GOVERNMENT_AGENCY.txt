The document analyzes a cyberattack targeting Chinese government agencies attributed to an advanced persistent threat (APT) group called APT-TOCS. The attack used two leading files to download additional payloads. One key payload was a remote access trojan that communicated with the attacker's command and control server. Analysis of the malware samples indicates the attack leveraged a commercial penetration testing tool called Cobalt Strike. Cobalt Strike enables covert command execution, file transfers, keylogging, and other capabilities. By comparing malware code snippets, network traffic, and other technical details to Cobalt Strike, the report concludes APT-TOCS used Cobalt Strike for this attack campaign. Cobalt Strike provides evasion, persistence, and multi-platform attack capabilities. The report warns that the increasing automation and commercial availability of advanced attack platforms like Cobalt Strike lowers barriers for targeted attacks. Even less sophisticated groups can leverage these tools for APT-style campaigns. Defenders must improve coordination and information sharing to combat the wider proliferation of customizable, stealthy attack platforms available to threat actors regardless of skill level. More advanced detection capabilities are needed to counter this evolving threat landscape.
