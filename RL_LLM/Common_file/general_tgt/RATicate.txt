The PDF describes a series of malware campaigns conducted by a threat actor group dubbed "RATicate" between November 2019 and January 2020. The campaigns distributed remote access trojans (RATs) and information stealers to target industrial companies in Europe, the Middle East, and South Korea. RATicate used Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) installers to distribute the malware payloads in the initial campaigns. The installers contained junk files intended to evade detection, as well as a custom loader developed by the threat actor to decrypt and inject the final payload. Analysis found the campaigns shared command and control infrastructure and payloads like Lokibot, Formbook, and AgentTesla, suggesting they were conducted by the same group. In total, 5 campaigns were identified between November 16, 2019 and January 8, 2020, each distributing different malware families to critical infrastructure companies. Later campaigns shifted tactics, using COVID-19 phishing lures and VBScript loaders, but still targeted the same companies, suggesting an ongoing operation. The motivations are unclear but could be corporate espionage or operating as a malware-as-a-service provider. An anti-analysis technique in one sample was found to be unintentional.
