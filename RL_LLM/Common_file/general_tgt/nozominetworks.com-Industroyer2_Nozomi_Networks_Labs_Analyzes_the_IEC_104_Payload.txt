The blog post analyzes the IEC 104 payload of Industroyer2, a recent malware sample used to target Ukraine's power grid. Industroyer2 shares many similarities with the original Industroyer malware used in the 2016 Ukraine grid attack. Industroyer2 is focused on manipulating IEC 104 and contains an unobfuscated configuration with hardcoded lists of Information Object Addresses (IOAs) to target. This suggests the attackers had extensive knowledge of the environment and insider access. The configuration defines station connection details and commands to send for each IOA like setting Single/Double commands and On/Off states. After killing a process and renaming itself, Industroyer2 sends IEC 104 commands based on the configuration to manipulate IOAs. A side-by-side comparison shows Industroyer2 shares code structure, global data, and functional logic with the original Industroyer sample. This indicates the same threat actor likely had access to the previous source code when developing the new version. The lack of obfuscation in Industroyer2 suggests the attackers were unconcerned about detection on the endpoint and had insider knowledge of the environment's security. Recommendations include improving cyber hygiene, using anomaly detection, threat hunting, and following advisories to protect ICS networks.
