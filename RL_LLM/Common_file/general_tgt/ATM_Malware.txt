ATM malware, also known as "ATM skimming" or "cash dispenser" malware, is a type of malicious software designed to steal card and transaction details from ATMs. This can result in millions of dollars in financial loss each year for both individuals and banks. The malware can be classified into two main types: virtual skimmers and cash dispensers. Virtual skimmers attempt to steal PINs, while cash dispensers allow attackers to dispense cash without authorization from the bank. There are several ways that this malware can be installed, including physical access to the device and indirect installation through compromised networks. The most common framework used is the CEN/XFS, but there are others like Kalignite. To protect against these attacks, it's important to ensure all systems running on ATMs have the latest security patches and operating system versions. Network visibility tools like Cisco Stealthwatch can also help. It's also important to monitor threat intelligence feeds for new threats and increase user awareness about the dangers of ATM malware. Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) can help prevent the execution of this malware, while web scanning and email security can detect and block threats.
