The report details a cyber espionage incident that affected RUAG, a Swiss technology company, from at least September 2014. The attackers used malware from the Turla family, which has been active for years targeting government and commercial organizations. The attackers showed patience in infiltrating RUAG's network and moving laterally to access sensitive data. Initial infection was through watering hole attacks that fingerprinted victims before delivering malware. The malware established an encrypted command and control channel to receive tasks for reconnaissance and data theft. A two-stage malware process was used. Initial recon malware gathered system info and could be replaced by fully-featured stage 2 malware that had more capabilities and persistence mechanisms. The stage 2 malware used a peer-to-peer botnet within the victim network to communicate and spread. Lateral movement relied on harvesting credentials with tools like Mimikatz and remotely executing tools like PsExec. Active Directory was a key target to gain control of devices and data. Data exfiltration occurred slowly over months, with spikes of activity. The attackers used encrypted HTTP posts to C&C servers to steal data. Recommendations include tighter system controls, monitoring Active Directory, network segmentation, centralized logging, malware detection, and organizational preparedness. Information sharing and cooperation between organizations is also highlighted as an important countermeasure. The report aims to provide technical details about the attack for organizations to improve defense and detection capabilities against advanced persistent threat actors. It stresses that attacks can happen despite security measures, so learning from incidents and raising awareness is critical.
