The PDF analyzes targeted attacks against South Korean organizations from September 2016 to December 2017 using malicious Hangul document files. Hangul is a Korean proprietary word processor widely used in South Korea, especially by the government. Attackers delivered the malware via email attachments or links to malicious Hangul files hosted on remote servers. Various techniques were used including vulnerabilities, JavaScript, Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), and embedded objects. EPS attacks were the most common. AhnLab identified 3 main attack groups - Group A targeted those connected to North Korea, Group B focused on virtual currency entities, and Group C targeted a North Korean human rights group. Groups A and B were responsible for most attacks. Payloads included downloaders, backdoors, and hard drive wiping malware. Earlier attacks directly installed backdoors through Hangul exploits but recent methods run malware only in memory, likely to evade detection. No new Hangul vulnerabilities have emerged since late 2016 meaning victims can prevent attacks by patching. Embedded objects still pose a threat however. AhnLab's analysis aims to raise awareness of the ongoing threat to South Korean entities, especially government, from targeted attacks abusing the popular Hangul software. Applying the latest Hangul updates and caution around objects are recommended.
