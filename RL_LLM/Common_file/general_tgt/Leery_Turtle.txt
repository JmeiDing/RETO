The report provides an overview of an advanced persistent threat (APT) group named Leery Turtle that has been active since at least late 2017. The group targets cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide through spear phishing campaigns to infect targets with custom malware. Leery Turtle employs extensive reconnaissance to find vulnerable entry points into target organizations, often sending non-malicious decoy documents to see who opens them. They carefully select and profile targets, including executive and technical staff roles. Their attacks mimic common file storage services like Google Drive in the phishing emails. The technical analysis examines their multi-stage malware delivery process, starting with a password-protected PDF sent in an email. An LNK shortcut is used to retrieve and execute a VBS script payload. The initial payload gathers system info and sends it to a command and control server, which then responds with a second stage VBS malware. This malware persists via a shortcut file and regularly connects to C2 to receive commands. The report maps the group's tactics to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, including spearphishing, startup folder persistence, process discovery, data encoding/obfuscation, and use of standard protocols. Suggested detection methods focus on odd shortcut files, DNS requests, and inbound port 8080 traffic. The report concludes that Leery Turtle is a systematic, persistent, and well-resourced threat group focused on stealing data from cryptocurrency companies for financial gain through targeted malware campaigns. Defenders are advised to monitor for the indicators and behaviors outlined.
