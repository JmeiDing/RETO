The PDF describes research by Check Point on an attack campaign they have named Volatile Cedar. The campaign uses a custom remote access trojan called Explosive to target individuals, companies, and institutions globally since late 2012. The initial infection vector is vulnerability scanning of public-facing web servers, followed by web shell installation to gain persistence. The attackers then move laterally to infect additional hosts on the internal network. Multiple versions of the Explosive trojan exist, each evolving to avoid detection and add new capabilities. Explosive has features for keylogging, screen captures, file exfiltration, and command execution. It communicates via encoded C2 traffic to a tiered network of hardcoded control servers, updaters, and DGA domains. The malware goes to great lengths to remain hidden through encoded configuration, limited operation windows, and frequent versioning. Attribution is made to a Lebanon-based group due to compilation timestamps, hosting providers, WHOIS details, and target verticals aligning with national interests. The targeted nature and low infection rate suggests a nation-state attacker rather than cybercrime motivation. In summary, this report provides a detailed analysis of an advanced, covert trojan and command infrastructure used by a persistent Middle Eastern threat actor in long-running, targeted surveillance campaigns against sensitive organizations globally.
