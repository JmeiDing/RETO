The report analyzes the Taidoor malware, used in ongoing cyber espionage campaigns since 2008 against government agencies, corporations, and think tanks, especially those related to Taiwan. Typically Taidoor is delivered via spear-phishing emails with malware-laden attachments. If opened, Taidoor is installed silently while showing a decoy document to avoid suspicion. Recent variants changed tactics - instead of directly dropping Taidoor, the attachments deploy "downloaders" that retrieve encrypted Taidoor malware from posts on Yahoo Blogs. The malware calls back to command servers using modified network traffic to avoid detection. The report examines the downloader's process of retrieving encrypted content from blogs, decrypting it to extract a Taidoor malware DLL, and its modified network callbacks. It also analyzes the related Taleret malware family which uses similar blog-based command and control. The modifications in recent Taidoor variants demonstrate this long-running threat continues to evolve evasion tactics, including using blogs for command and control and altering network traffic patterns. The attacks remain focused on targets related to Taiwan.
