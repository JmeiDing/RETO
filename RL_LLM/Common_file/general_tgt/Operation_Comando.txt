The PDF describes an ongoing hacking campaign called Operation Comando that is targeting the hospitality industry, particularly hotel reservations, in order to steal credit card information. The campaign uses phishing emails with malicious attachments to infect victims with information-stealing malware. The attackers use dynamic DNS services and compromised websites to host their infrastructure. They consistently use the acronym "CDT" in their activities. Analysis uncovered a custom malware family called CapturaTela that captures screenshots when certain credit card purchase windows are open in order to steal credit card info. The attackers also make extensive use of common remote access trojans like LimeRAT, RevengeRAT, and others acquired from underground forums and GitHub to expand their capabilities beyond just credit card theft. Researchers were able to trace the infrastructure, pivot on clues left behind by the attackers, and observe the malware functionality to uncover the main objective of credit card data theft. This demonstrates how even unsophisticated actors can operate successful cybercrime campaigns on a budget using dynamic DNS, RATs, and basic coding knowledge. Recommendations are made to detect the campaign infrastructure, block the malicious files, and share intelligence to systematically disrupt the hackers.
