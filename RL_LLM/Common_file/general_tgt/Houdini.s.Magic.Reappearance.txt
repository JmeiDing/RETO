The PDF is a threat analysis report by Palo Alto Networks examining new campaigns utilizing the Hworm/Houdini malware against targets in the Middle East. It analyzes Hworm samples distributed via social engineering through SFX files themed around political issues. The SFX droppers use decoy documents and videos while installing the payload. The report examines the VBS loader, configuration, shellcode, and capabilities of the Hworm RAT which can capture screenshots, keylogs, spread laterally etc. It also covers the command protocol, infrastructure, and beta builder leaked in 2015. The new version analyzed uses a different TCP-based command and control protocol compared to prior Hworm versions. The samples beacon out to various domains and IPs linked to this active campaign. Network and host-based indicators of compromise are provided including mutexes, C2 IPs, sample hashes and Yara rules to detect the malware. In summary, the threat analysis provides a technical breakdown of an ongoing cyberespionage campaign deploying updated Hworm malware, its Capabilities, and recommendations for detection and prevention.
