The report details cyberespionage activities targeting South Korean users that are attributed to the Lazarus Group APT, a sophisticated threat actor from North Korea. Throughout 2021-2022, the group has been conducting spear phishing campaigns posing as the South Korean portal Naver and other entities to distribute malware. The malware goes through multiple stages to evade detection, steal system info, and communicate with attacker C2 servers. ThreatLabz researchers were able to correlate infrastructure like IP addresses, domains, and email addresses used in these attacks with past Lazarus Group campaigns. Passive DNS analysis connected the attacks to IP addresses linked to prior Lazarus activity. The attacks have evolved over time, recently using Dropbox and compromised websites to distribute malware. Spear phishing emails originate from South Korean IP addresses. The group tailors social engineering lures to the target's region, often involving cryptocurrency and technology themes. The exact motives are unclear but targeting South Korean users aligns with Lazarus Group's interests. The report contains indicators of compromise like file hashes, network infrastructure, and emails to help defend against this active threat. In summary, Lazarus Group has been conducting a sophisticated, evolving spear phishing campaign against South Korean users for over a year that ThreatLabz attributes to the North Korean Lazarus APT group based on infrastructure links to prior activity.
