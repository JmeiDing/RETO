The document analyzes a type of malware called Skeleton Key that was discovered by researchers at Dell SecureWorks. Skeleton Key is designed to bypass single-factor password authentication on Active Directory domain controllers running certain 64-bit Windows operating systems. By exploiting the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process, Skeleton Key allows threat actors to authenticate as any user on the domain using a password of their choice. It does this by patching LSASS functions in memory to essentially ignore the entered password. Skeleton Key provides unfettered access to remote services like email and VPNs that rely on single-factor domain authentication. It can also allow physical login to domain-joined systems. The malware has been observed being deployed using stolen domain admin credentials. It lacks persistence and must be redeployed after a reboot using remote access tools. Skeleton Key deployments appear to correlate with unexplained domain replication issues. The report provides in-depth technical analysis of Skeleton Key's operation, including the patching process, compatibility checks, imported functions, and process injection. It also covers detection methods via logs and memory forensics. Anti-virus signatures are ineffective since it runs only in memory. Recommendations include implementing multi-factor authentication and monitoring process creation/service events for signs of Skeleton Key deployment. The report aims to raise awareness of this threat's risk to single-factor authentication environments.
