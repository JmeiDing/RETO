The document describes a new campaign distributing the Ursnif banking Trojan (also known as Gozi or Dreambot) that began on March 24, 2020. The malware is distributed in a multistage process across three payloads: 1. A Word document containing VBA macros that decode and drop an HTML file. 2. The HTML file contains obfuscated JavaScript and ActiveX code that reaches out to download the final payload DLL. 3. The DLL contains the Ursnif banking Trojan that is executed via regsvr32. The attackers have shifted from using PowerShell in the second stage to using mshta.exe instead. Mshta can be used to bypass application whitelisting and security settings in the browser. The VBA macros are obfuscated but contain no anti-analysis checks. They generate strings, copy mshta.exe, write the HTML payload, and execute it. The HTML payload is heavily obfuscated but deobfuscation reveals it uses ActiveX for file operations. It decodes a function that contains the URL for the final payload DLL. It downloads this payload and saves it as index.dll before executing it with regsvr32. Using regsvr32 instead of rundll32 may be an attempt to avoid detection. The final DLL payload contains the Ursnif banking Trojan that runs in DllMain without exports. This new version of Ursnif appears designed to avoid detection, leave fewer footprints, and steal victims' data. The campaign used multiple newly registered domains that followed a consistent naming pattern.
