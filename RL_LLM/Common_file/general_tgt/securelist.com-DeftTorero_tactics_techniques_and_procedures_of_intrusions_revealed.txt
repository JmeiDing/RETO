The report details the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by the Middle Eastern threat actor group DeftTorero (also known as Lebanese Cedar) in intrusions between late 2019 and mid-2021. The threat actor is believed to originate from the Middle East and was first publicly disclosed in 2015. They have been observed to use fileless/LOLBINS techniques and common offensive tools available on the internet for blending in with other threat activities. Initial access is gained by exploiting vulnerabilities allowing webshell deployment. Discovery activities enumerate system info, users, network connections, etc. Credentials are dumped using Mimikatz, Lazagne, LSASS process dumping, etc. Execution usesliving-off-the-land binaries like Regsvr32 and MSIExec to bypass defenses. The end goal is deploying the custom Explosive RAT malware. Explosive RAT has minimal updates to evade signatures. Its command and control communications attempt to mimic legitimate browser traffic. The group heavily focuses on obtaining credentials at each step. Victims are primarily in the Middle East. Defenses should center on monitoring web server integrity, scanning backups, application whitelisting to block interpreter-based techniques, and watching for abnormal living-off-the-land binary execution flows.
