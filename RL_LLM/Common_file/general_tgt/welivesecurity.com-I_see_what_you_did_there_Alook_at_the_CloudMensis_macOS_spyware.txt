The PDF describes research by ESET on a new macOS malware called CloudMensis that exfiltrates documents, screenshots, and keystrokes from compromised devices. CloudMensis is a two-stage malware written in Objective-C. The first stage downloads the main component from cloud storage using an access token. The second stage spyware persistently installs as a daemon and collects data. The malware exclusively uses public cloud storage services like Dropbox, pCloud, and Yandex for command and control and to exfiltrate stolen data. Encrypted configuration details which file types to collect along with authentication tokens. CloudMensis can bypass macOS privacy controls like TCC to access the screen, keyboard, and removable media without prompting the user. It also contains old code to clean up artifacts after exploiting now-patched vulnerabilities. Collected files are archived and encrypted before uploading to cloud storage. Operators can send commands to list processes, take screenshots, run shell commands, and more. Metadata shows over 50 victims compromised from February to April 2022. While not the most advanced threat, CloudMensis shows macOS users are being targeted by persistent attackers. Its limited distribution suggests specific targets of interest to the threat actors behind this malware.
