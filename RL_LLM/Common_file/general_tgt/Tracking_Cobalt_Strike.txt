The PDF describes an investigation by Trend Micro into a Cobalt Strike infection detected by their Managed XDR service. The investigation started with an alert about suspicious activity on one endpoint, labeled Endpoint-1. Further analysis of Endpoint-1 revealed additional indicators of compromise like the execution of mobsync.exe, connections to suspicious IP addresses, and the use of hacking tools like Bloodhound and ADFind to gather information from Active Directory. The investigation expanded by hunting for related indicators of compromise on other endpoints monitored by Trend Micro's Vision One platform. This revealed additional infected endpoints like Endpoint-2 and Endpoint-3 which showed similar suspicious behavior and Cobalt Strike detections. By correlating the indicators between multiple endpoints, Trend Micro was able to trace the infection back to a spear phishing email with a malicious Excel attachment that was forwarded internally by the original recipient. This endpoint that received the initial phishing email was identified as Patient Zero. Throughout the investigation, Trend Micro provided ongoing updates to the affected customer so infected endpoints could be isolated and user accounts disabled to contain the threat. They collected related artifacts for further analysis and submitted them for improved detection coverage. They also recommended actions like blocking command and control IP addresses to prevent further spread. The key lessons learned are the importance of a layered security approach, taking preliminary alerts seriously, and the need for thorough incident response processes. Trend Micro was able to leverage their various technologies to unravel the full scope of the infection and provide actionable guidance to the customer.
