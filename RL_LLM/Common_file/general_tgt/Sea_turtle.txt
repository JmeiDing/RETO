The threat actor group behind the "Sea Turtle" DNS hijacking campaign continues to be active, using new infrastructure and techniques after being publicly exposed. Talos discovered they are using a new DNS hijacking technique to redirect traffic to actor-controlled servers and harvest credentials. This new technique involves briefly modifying a domain's name server records to point to an actor-controlled name server that resolves the same IP address as the legitimate hostname. Talos also found the group compromised the Greek ccTLD registry ICS-Forth in April 2019 and used that access to hijack government domains using a new actor-controlled nameserver rootdnservers[.]com. Additional malicious IPs were identified being used for man-in-the-middle attacks to harvest credentials from government, energy, think tank, NGO, airport, telecom, and other organizations primarily in the Middle East and North Africa region. Talos recommends organizations implement MFA for their domain registrar, use registry lock services, enable DNSSEC, restrict IMAP access, and monitor DNS records to defend against this threat. The Sea Turtle actors have proven persistent and are expected to continue DNS hijacking despite public exposure.
