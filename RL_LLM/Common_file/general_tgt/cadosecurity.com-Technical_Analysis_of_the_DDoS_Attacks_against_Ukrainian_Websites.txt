The document is a technical analysis report by cybersecurity firm Cado Security regarding DDoS attacks against Ukrainian websites in February 2022. Several Ukrainian banks, government agencies, and military websites were hit by DDoS attacks on February 15-16, 2022. The attacks were moderate in scale and the sites recovered within hours. Analysis identified the DDoS botnet used as Katana, which is a variant of Mirai malware with enhanced DDoS capabilities. Vulnerable internet-connected devices like IP cameras were exploited to build the botnet. Preparation for the attacks was detected starting on February 13 when a sample Linux malware binary associated with Katana botnet was uploaded. This indicates the botnet infrastructure was set up at least a couple days prior. The attacks combined DDoS, SMS messaging, DNS server attacks, and BGP hijacking to maximize impact. The intention was assessed as destabilization and panic, fitting previous cyber campaigns linked to regional conflicts. Though the impact was limited, the coordinated use of multiple attack techniques showed sophistication. Cado Security suggests that organizations ensure they have DDoS protections and incident response capabilities in place.
