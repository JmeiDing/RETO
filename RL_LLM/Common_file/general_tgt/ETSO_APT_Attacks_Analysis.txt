The report by AhnLab details an analysis of advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks attributed to a group they call ETSO. The attacks targeted 12 companies in South Korea from 2010-2013. ETSO's attacks involve compromising public-facing servers and spreading malware internally to establish backdoors and steal data. Tactics include hijacking product updates, credential theft, disabling logs, encoding C2 traffic, and bootkit persistence. The group continues attacks even after detection. The report provides an overview of ETSO's attack lifecycle: - Initial compromise via phishing emails or compromising product updates. - Gaining foothold by installing backdoors on systems. - Escalating privileges by stealing credentials with tools like Mimikatz. - Lateral movement using credentials and network shares to spread. - Maintaining presence via bootkits, fileless malware, and reinfection. - Stealing data from databases using SQL injection and commands. AhnLab believes ETSO is financially motivated and has improved tactics over time. Forensic analysis uncovered similarities between ETSO malware and families attributed to Chinese APT groups Winnti and PlugX. Network and malware analysis found ETSO malware connects to a master controller, uses encrypted C2 traffic, and was likely developed by a Chinese individual associated with the ID whg0001. AhnLab notes ETSO focuses on maintaining access versus destruction, uses zero-day exploits before public disclosure, and targets cryptocurrency companies demonstrating an interest in theft. The report concludes with detection and response recommendations against ETSO's advanced techniques.
