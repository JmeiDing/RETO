The FBI and CISA have observed ongoing cyber intrusions by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors targeting U.S. think tanks, especially those focused on international affairs or national security. The actors use various initial access vectors like phishing and exploiting web-facing devices. Once inside a network, the actors rely on tactics like scheduled tasks, PowerShell, and Windows services for execution. They establish persistence using methods like login scripts, Outlook add-ins, and modifying the registry. Escalation uses token manipulation, DLL side-loading, and bypassing user access control. The actors evade defenses via clearing logs, binary padding, code signing, hiding files/artifacts, and disabling security tools. They access credentials through keylogging, dumping LSASS memory, password spraying, and stealing access tokens. Lateral movement leverages RDP, SSH, and passing hashes. Exfiltration occurs over C2 channels and removable media. Impacts include data encryption, disk wiping, and system shutdown. The advisory provides an extensive MITRE ATT&CK profile of the group's tactics. Mitigation recommendations focus on training users, applying patches, segmenting networks, implementing strong authentication, monitoring systems, and restricting access. Affected organizations should contact the FBI or CISA for incident response support.
