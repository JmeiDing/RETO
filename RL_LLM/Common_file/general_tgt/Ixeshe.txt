The document analyzes the IXESHE cyberespionage campaign, which has been actively conducting targeted attacks since at least July 2009. The attackers primarily target East Asian governments, Taiwanese electronics manufacturers, and a German telecommunications company. The main attack vector is spearphishing emails with malicious PDF attachments exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE-2009-4324. This drops malware that gives the attackers full control of compromised systems. The malware communicates with command and control (C&C) servers using a specific encoded format. The attackers make use of compromised machines as C&C servers, including victims' own networks, to hide their activities. They use tools like HTran to proxy connections and mask their real location. While attribution is unclear, some indicators point to an English-speaking threat actor. The report provides a timeline of IXESHE activity and samples, with campaign codes used to track attacks. It outlines tactics, techniques, and procedures, as well as recommendations for defending against targeted attacks through threat intelligence, network monitoring, employee training, and data-centric protection. Trend Micro solutions can detect and block IXESHE components at multiple layers. In summary, the report provides an in-depth analysis of the sophisticated but active IXESHE cyberespionage campaign, its activities, attribution clues, and how organizations can defend themselves against similar targeted attacks.
