The Trellix threat research team analyzed a recent "ransomware" campaign targeting Ukraine that appears to be a wiper disguised as ransomware. The attack has four stages: 1. An executable overwrites the master boot record (MBR) to make the system unbootable and displays a fake ransom note. 2. A second stage executable downloads the third stage payload from a Discord CDN server. It uses signed binaries and purports to be a Microsoft file. 3. The third stage .NET loader disables Windows Defender using AdvancedRun, deletes Defender files, and injects the fourth stage wiper. 4. The wiper iterates drives to overwrite 191 file extensions with garbage data. It then deletes itself and reboots the system. While made to look like typical ransomware financially motivated crime, the lack of effort to restore systems indicates the true purpose is likely data destruction. The attack leverages PowerShell, VBScript, and living off the land tools. The campaign targets Ukraine but has also been seen globally at low levels. Indicators of compromise have been incorporated into Trellix products. Customers are advised to ensure ENS definitions are updated and advanced threat detection features are enabled. The research provides guidance on investigation and insights into the full attack chain.
