The report analyzes a January 2018 targeted malware campaign by the Lotus Blossom advanced persistent threat (APT) group against the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The attack starts with a malicious RTF document distributed via malspam. When opened, it exploits CVE-2017-11882 to drop a malicious DLL which then injects into Explorer to install the Elise backdoor malware. Elise establishes persistence and contacts its command and control server at 103.236.150[.]14 to begin exfiltrating data from the victim machine. The C2 communications use encoded and encrypted cookies for stealth. The malware pretends to be a fake Norton module and uses decoy domains in its headers, but actually connects to the same hardcoded IP address. This attack shows Lotus Blossom's continued interest in the ASEAN as an espionage target following previous watering hole attacks. The report examines the infection process, capabilities, and infrastructure used in this campaign. It highlights the increased sophistication of cyber operations by nation-state actors in Southeast Asia, emphasizing the need for awareness, defense, and attribution capabilities against such threats. In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at a targeted attack by the Lotus Blossom APT group against the ASEAN utilizing the Elise malware and other tricks to avoid detection.
