The PDF describes targeted cyberattacks conducted by a threat actor group named RANCOR against entities in Southeast Asia. The attacks used spearphishing emails with document lures hosting malware. The lures contained politically-motivated content related to Cambodia. Two custom malware families were used - PLAINTEE and DDKONG. PLAINTEE is a newer addition that uses a custom UDP C2 protocol. DDKONG has been used since early 2017 and phones home over TCP. Both families can download additional plugins from the C2 server. The attacks could be split into two clusters based on infrastructure, but were linked by the use of PLAINTEE. The attackers likely compromised a Cambodian government website to host some of their malware. PLAINTEE collects system info and sends it to the C2. It spawns threads to load plugins that can execute shell commands or manipulate files. DDKONG also exfiltrates documents and accepts command execution tasks. Some code overlap was found between PLAINTEE and the Retro backdoor previously linked to DarkHotel. RANCOR appears to be a new actor focused on political entities in SE Asia, but may share some code bases with DarkHotel. Palo Alto Networks has visibility on these malware families and can protect customers via WildFire sandboxing and Traps endpoint protection. The report provides IOCs and AutoFocus tracking tags for the samples discussed.
