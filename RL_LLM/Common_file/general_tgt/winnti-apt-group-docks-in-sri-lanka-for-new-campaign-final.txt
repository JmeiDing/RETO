The document describes a new cyberattack campaign attributed to the Chinese state-sponsored Winnti hacking group that targeted government entities in Sri Lanka in August 2022. The attackers distributed malware hidden in an ISO file masquerading as economic assistance information. The malware used multiple layers of obfuscation and encryption to hide its functionality. It established command and control via the Dropbox API to avoid detection. The initial payload was a custom backdoor named DBoxAgent that conducted reconnaissance and downloaded additional payloads. A second stage payload named SerialVlogger decrypted and loaded a third stage loader malware. The final payload was a Winnti backdoor called KeyPlug that gave the attackers full remote access and control. KeyPlug and other tactics align with previous Winnti campaigns. The timing coincided with the arrival of a Chinese naval research vessel at a strategic Sri Lankan port that India and others view as a security threat. Sri Lanka's economic crisis and strategic location provide context for China's interests. The report concludes Winnti remains a sophisticated and active threat actor expanding its reach in South Asia. Sharing findings enabled defensive actions to be taken. The campaign highlights geopolitical tensions with China in the region.
