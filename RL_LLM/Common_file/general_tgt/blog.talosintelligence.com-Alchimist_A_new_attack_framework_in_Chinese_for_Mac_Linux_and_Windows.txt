The PDF discusses the discovery of a new attack framework called Alchimist by Cisco Talos researchers. Alchimist is a command and control tool with a web interface in Simplified Chinese used for remote administration. It can generate payloads for and control a new remote access trojan called Insekt, implemented in Go and targeting Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Alchimist extracts embedded assets at runtime to set up its web interface and Insekt payloads. The web UI can configure and deliver Insekt to compromised machines. Insekt has various remote access capabilities like arbitrary command execution, screenshot capture, and more. It communicates over HTTPS, WS, or SNI protocols. The framework also contains other tools for exploitation, lateral movement, and exfiltration. Links are provided between Alchimist, Insekt, and associated infrastructure. While the threat actor behind the framework is unknown, indicators suggest it is being used in active attacks. The PDF analyzes Insekt's capabilities and Alchimist's payload generation process. It highlights the rise of customizable C2 frameworks leveraging languages like Go.
