The document provides an analysis of the cyberespionage operations of SideCopy, a Pakistani APT group targeting South Asia. SideCopy utilizes phishing emails containing archived files to infect victims, often with romantic lures, such as girl names, Schengen Visa application forms, resumes, and documents with .3d extension, to lure their victims. The archived files have embedded malicious links, Office docs, or trojanized apps that execute payloads fetching remote HTAs. This ultimately installs remote access trojans like AllaKore. Researchers uncovered SideCopy infrastructure including a "Scout" system to monitor victim infections and exfiltrated data. The group successfully compromised targets in the Afghanistan government and military to steal credentials and documents. New SideCopy attacks leverage weaponized Publisher files and trojanized apps to deploy payloads. A newly observed AuTo stealer written in C++ exfiltrates documents and data over HTTP and TCP. SideCopy quickly incorporates new techniques and payloads while continuing to pursue intelligence objectives in South Asia. The group's operations rely on tailored phishing lures like romantic themes and content targeting specific organizations.
