The document analyzes a recent phishing campaign conducted by a threat actor known as NOBELIUM, which is believed to be linked to Russian intelligence. NOBELIUM has targeted government and non-governmental organizations in the past. The phishing campaign used HTML files attached to emails that extracted ISO files containing malicious payloads. Two examples are analyzed - one targeting an Iranian embassy and another a Turkish embassy. The ISO files contain HTA files that execute PowerShell commands to store shellcode in the registry. The shellcode loads a Cobalt Strike beacon to establish command and control. Analysis of the infrastructure shows NOBELIUM registered domains a year prior but only recently set up C2 servers. This was likely done to avoid detection based on domain registration dates. While low in sophistication, the infection chain matches NOBELIUM's previous attacks. However, the techniques could also be copycats. Indicators of compromise are provided, including domain names, IP addresses, file hashes, and Yara rules. Additional suspected domains are listed that may be tied to other threat actors using similar techniques. In summary, the document provides a detailed analysis of a phishing campaign attributed to NOBELIUM targeting foreign embassies, including the infection chain, infrastructure, and IOCs. While basic in approach, NOBELIUM has proven adept at gaining access and pivoting once inside target networks.
