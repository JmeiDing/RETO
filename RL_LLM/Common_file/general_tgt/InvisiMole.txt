The document provides an in-depth analysis of the cyberespionage group InvisiMole, which has been active since at least 2013 targeting Eastern Europe. InvisiMole uses a sophisticated, stealthy toolset that has undergone continuous improvements to avoid detection. Notable techniques include per-victim encryption, custom shellcode structures, and living off the land by abusing legitimate tools. Four distinct execution chains were analyzed, showing techniques like BYOVD to exploit third-party software vulnerabilities, BYOVS to exploit vulnerable Windows components, and abusing Control Panel items for persistence. InvisiMole uses lateral movement techniques including EternalBlue, BlueKeep, and trojanized software installers. Two backdoors, RC2CL and RC2FM, provide extensive espionage capabilities. A new DNS tunneling component was also uncovered. The analysis revealed cooperation between InvisiMole and the Gamaredon group, with Gamaredon used to gain initial access before deploying InvisiMole on high-value targets. The report emphasizes InvisiMole's continued development, stealthiness, and versatility, making it a sophisticated threat. Recommendations include strengthening Linux and Windows security to detect advanced threats like InvisiMole.
