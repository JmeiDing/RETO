The document analyzes a new remote access Trojan called TigerRAT that has been used in attacks since late 2020. TigerRAT is delivered via a custom loader that decrypts the payload stored inside the binary. The payload uses RC4 and DES encryption and custom protocols to communicate with command and control servers. TigerRAT has capabilities to manipulate files, capture screens, log keystrokes, and tunnel traffic. It runs commands sent from the C2 server via modules that handle specific functions. Analysis identifies similarities to malware attributed to Lazarus group subgroups. TigerRAT exhibits tactics like credential access, collection, exfiltration, and encrypted C2 channels. Detection methods include monitoring for suspicious process behavior like launching shells, blocking unknown software that spawns shells, and network signatures. IOCs are provided for the malware samples and C2 servers. In summary, the report provides an in-depth analysis of the new TigerRAT malware family, its delivery technique, C2 protocol, capabilities, attacker ties, detection methods, and IOCs for defenders.
