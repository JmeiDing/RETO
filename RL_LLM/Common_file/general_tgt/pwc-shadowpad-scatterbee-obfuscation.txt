The report by PwC provides an in-depth analysis of a new obfuscation technique called ScatterBee used by the China-based threat actor Red Dev 10 with the backdoor malware ShadowPad. PwC discovered ScatterBee while monitoring for ShadowPad activity. ScatterBee utilizes multiple obfuscation methods including control flow obfuscation, string encoding, dynamic API resolution, and shellcode patching to evade analysis and detection. The analysis examines a malicious DLL loader dropping a ScatterBee packed ShadowPad payload. It details how ScatterBee works and techniques to deobfuscate and analyze the malware. PwC also uncovered other malicious files linked to ScatterBee-obfuscated ShadowPad. PwC assesses victims were targeted using trojanized software like Flash installers to deliver the ShadowPad malware. The targeting aligns with previous victims of Red Dev 10 and ShadowPad, including military and aerospace organizations. The report concludes ShadowPad continues to be used for stealthy, long-term compromise of sensitive organizations despite public exposure. ScatterBee represents the latest attempt to minimize detection. PwC will continue monitoring new obfuscation techniques used with ShadowPad.
