Mandiant responded to an incident where an attacker deployed malware called TRITON to manipulate industrial safety systems. The attack targeted Triconex safety instrumented systems (SIS) which provide emergency shutdown for industrial processes. The attackers gained remote access to an SIS engineering workstation and deployed the TRITON framework to reprogram the SIS controllers. Some controllers entered a failed safe state, prompting an investigation that uncovered the malware. TRITON is capable of disrupting safety mechanisms that could result in physical consequences. The activity is consistent with a nation state preparing for an attack, though attribution was not made. TRITON follows a similar pattern to Stuxnet and Industroyer in targeting industrial control systems. The threat model shows options for attackers including causing shutdowns, allowing unsafe states, or manipulating a hazardous process. Recommended mitigations include segregating and controlling access to safety systems, monitoring ICS traffic, and implementing strict application whitelisting. Asset owners should prepare for attacks intended to cause physical damage. The incident demonstrates emerging adversary interest in developing capabilities to impact industrial safety systems. Defenders should adapt techniques from IT security and identify anomalies in ICS networks.
