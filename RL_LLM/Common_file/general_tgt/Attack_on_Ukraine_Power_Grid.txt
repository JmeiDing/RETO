In December 2015, cyber attacks caused power outages for 225,000 customers across 3 distribution utilities in Ukraine. The attacks involved spear phishing and custom malware including BlackEnergy3, KillDisk, and malicious serial-to-ethernet firmware. The attacks followed the ICS Cyber Kill Chain, first gaining access to IT networks and then attacking ICS components to cause effects. The attackers conducted long-term reconnaissance, stole credentials, and utilized VPNs to pivot to ICS networks. The core attack involved using operator HMIs to open breakers, wiping SCADA systems with KillDisk, and blowing up communication bridges. The attackers also launched telephone denial-of-service attacks on call centers. Recommended defensive mitigation strategies involve improving architecture, logging, segmentation, monitoring, response planning, and information sharing. Future attacks may vary tactics so defense must be flexible. The attacks crossed lines by publicly targeting civilian critical infrastructure. The implications are that defenders must prepare for highly targeted synchronized attacks that burn bridges. Information sharing and cooperation were key. The response by Ukraine was impressive but the attack could succeed in many countries. Infrastructure defenders globally must learn from this case.
