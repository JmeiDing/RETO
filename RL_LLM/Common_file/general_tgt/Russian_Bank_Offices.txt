The report describes a broad phishing campaign targeting bank offices in Russia in August 2017. The phishing emails purported to be from disgruntled bank customers complaining about extra credit card charges. The emails contained malicious Excel attachments exploiting an Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) vulnerability, likely CVE-2017-0262. The attachments used obfuscation including XOR encoding and repetitive comments. They contained lyrics from a Slipknot song and comments insulting Kaspersky. The payload installed malware performing command and control callbacks to a compromised Minecraft server. The malware shares similarities with previous campaigns attributed to finanicially-motivated actors in Russia. The attacks aimed to compromise bank systems, likely for financial fraud or theft. The bank office targeting and social engineering technique of spoofing customers is an unusual approach compared to more common phishing of bank customers. The report examines the obfuscation, payload, infrastructure, and possible attribution. It highlights the ongoing threat of phishing and exploits used in cybercrime against the finance sector in Russia and surrounding countries.
