The document analyzes the Gauss cyberespionage malware, attributed to nation-state actors, that has been active since 2011. Gauss is modular and uses encrypted C&C communications, code links, and infrastructure similarities to tie it to the developers of Stuxnet and Flame. Its main component is the ShellHW backdoor. Modules gather system info, steal browser data, and target Lebanese bank accounts. The Windows DLLs use rootkit techniques to hide files and processes. The USB payload infects removable drives and extracts data from compromised hosts. The encrypted payload has an unknown purpose. Infection is focused in Lebanon, Israel, and Palestine and leverages spearphishing documents. Gauss C2 infrastructure spans the US, India, and Portugal using fake identities and hotels as domain registrants. While Flame targeted Iran, Gauss focuses on Lebanon, likely referencing the origin of its name. The financial trojan aspect is the first publicly known case of nation-state sponsored bank account theft. Gauss demonstrates the sophisticated capabilities and global reach of nation-state cyberespionage. Its modular structure, encryption, stealth, and targeting represent the advanced threats that defensive cyber analysts continue working to detect and mitigate.
