In November 2018, Microsoft's Windows Defender ATP team uncovered a cyberattack targeting energy and food/beverage companies in Asia. Based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures, Microsoft believes the threat actor group Tropic Trooper was likely behind this attack. The attack exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Office (CVE-2018-0802) to deliver malware. The malware used process hollowing and communicated with a remote C2 server. Windows Defender ATP generated multiple alerts on suspicious activities related to the attack. The alerts triggered Windows Defender ATP's device risk calculation, assigning the highest risk score to affected machines. The high risk score enabled conditional access policies to block the compromised devices from accessing sensitive corporate data. This protected the broader network. Automated investigation and remediation in Windows Defender ATP kicked in to contain the threat, remediate affected devices, and restore normal operations. Microsoft Threat Protection capabilities like Office 365 ATP and Azure Active Directory integrated to block email delivery, share threat intelligence, and coordinate response. This demonstrates how Microsoft's integrated security solutions work together to detect emerging targeted attacks, assess risk, orchestrate response, and automatically protect assets.
