The document analyzes an espionage campaign targeting Hong Kong democracy activists using two new malware families named UP007 and SLServer. The malware was delivered via a phishing email with a Google Drive link containing a RAR archive. The archive had shortcuts to execute the malware executables buried in hidden directories. UP007 collects keystrokes and sends them to a command and control server, while SLServer downloads additional payloads. Overlaps were found between the infrastructure used in this campaign and previous cyber espionage operations targeting groups in Burma, Thailand, and Tibet. Technical analysis is provided of the infection chains, encryption schemes, network communication, and anti-analysis features for both malware families. UP007 masquerades its traffic as Microsoft updates and clears DNS caches before connecting to C2 servers. SLServer verifies downloaded payloads via signature checks. In total, 20 phishing emails were sent to Hong Kong activists in the week prior to the January 2016 Taiwanese election. The lures claimed to provide information and forecasts related to the election. The attacks appear connected to a broader set of cyber espionage campaigns in Asia based on tactic and infrastructure reuse. However, attribution remains unclear. Indicators of compromise are included for the malware samples, C2 infrastructure, and decoy documents. The espionage campaign demonstrates an effort to collect data from Hong Kong democracy advocates through stealthy malware. Connections to previous activity highlight the persistent targeting of civil society groups in Asia.
