The document discusses strategic web compromises targeting the Afghan government's websites. Attackers have modified JavaScript files loaded from the government's content delivery network (CDN) system to inject malicious code into a number of ministry and office websites. Specifically, the jQuery file on the CDN server was modified to include obfuscated JavaScript utilizing the Dean Edwards Packer and base62 encoding. This code exploits the CVE-2015-5119 Flash vulnerability to selectively target visitors. The attackers appear to be whitelisting specific IP ranges, likely government and defense entities, to receive the exploit code. Other visitors receive error responses. This selective exploitation allows the threat actors to fly under the radar. The same CDN server was compromised earlier this year in a similar manner by modifying a different JavaScript file. However, this new attack demonstrates the adversaries have evolved their tactics using obfuscation to hide the malicious activity. The report contains indicators of compromise including the affected jQuery file, IP addresses, and HTTP request patterns to detect the ongoing exploitation. The strategic web compromises aim to turn government websites into attack platforms against high-value targets visiting them. Threat intelligence sharing and vigilance around government-affiliated sites is critical to countering this attack vector. Overall, the analysis provides insight into how sophisticated adversaries like APT groups are compromising public-facing assets and leveraging whitelisting for targeted exploitation against high-value victims.
