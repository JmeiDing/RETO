The report describes a cyberespionage campaign called Operation CloudyOmega that has been targeting Japanese organizations since at least 2011. The attackers exploit vulnerabilities in software like Ichitaro to infect systems with remote access trojans (RATs) like Emdivi to steal data. The public sector in Japan has been hit the most by the campaign. Phishing emails containing malicious document attachments are sent to targets, exploiting the Ichitaro software as one infection vector. The emails have content related to recent Japan political events to seem authentic. Once infected, the Emdivi RAT allows attackers to execute code and steal credentials. It connects to command and control servers hosted on compromised Japanese websites, many hosted by a single cloud provider. Over 50 domains across 13 IPs have been identified. Emdivi malware samples contain unique version numbers that act as encryption keys. The malware has evasion techniques to avoid detection and analysis. Two main variants called Type S and Type T exist, with Type T being the primary one used. Links between CloudyOmega and other APT groups like Hidden Lynx suggest a shared parent organization that provides tools and exploits. The recent Ichitaro zero-day attack involved Emdivi and other payloads, indicating distribution of the exploit. Overall, CloudyOmega demonstrates persistent, sophisticated targeting of Japanese organizations for cyberespionage through exploiting vulnerabilities and tricking users. Ongoing monitoring and protection against the evolving tactics is needed.
