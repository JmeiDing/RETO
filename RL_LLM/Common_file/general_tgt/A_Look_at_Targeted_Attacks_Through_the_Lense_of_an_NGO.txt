The paper analyzes targeted cyberattacks against a human rights NGO representing the Uyghur minority in China. The authors examined 1,493 suspicious emails received by two NGO volunteers over 4 years. They found the emails were highly tailored in language and topic to the victims, with most written in their native Uyghur language. Senders were often impersonated, including compromised accounts of high-profile activists. While recent studies found executables and archives were common attack vectors, this study found malicious Office documents were most prevalent. The documents exploited recent but disclosed vulnerabilities that tended to bypass defenses. No zero-days were observed. Analysis of the malware payloads revealed the NGO was targeted by different families over time. Over a quarter exhibited similarities to malware linked to targeted attacks against political, industrial, and Tibetan groups by known threat actors. The study shows the value of tracking old indicators of compromise across campaigns. It provides an in-depth look at social engineering and attack vectors used in the reconnaissance phase before a compromise. The authors released the malware dataset to further research on targeted attacks.
