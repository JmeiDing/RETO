The document describes a cyberespionage operation called Operation In(ter)ception that targeted European aerospace and military companies in late 2019. The attackers used LinkedIn to send malicious files disguised as job offers to employees at the companies. Once opened, the files installed a custom backdoor on the victims' systems. The backdoor consisted of two stages - an initial downloader and the main backdoor payload. It communicated with command servers via HTTPS using custom protocols. The malware gathered system information and had capabilities to download additional modules, exfiltrate data, and execute commands. The attackers frequently recompiled the malware and used living off the land tactics like certutil, WMIC, PowerShell, rundll32, etc. to hide their activity. They impersonated legitimate companies and signed some components with a certificate issued to a real US company. After compromising targets, the attackers moved laterally through the networks. In one case, they attempted a business email compromise attack to monetize the access. The malware appears tailored for espionage against the aerospace/defense sectors. While the malware is technically advanced, researchers found no clear attribution to a known threat group. There were some similarities to tools and techniques used by Lazarus, but not enough for definitive attribution. In summary, this was a sophisticated, targeted attack campaign aimed at stealing sensitive data from European defense contractors, leveraging custom malware, living off the land tactics, and social engineering.
