The PDF describes an investigation by Kaspersky researchers into potential links between the ExPetr/NotPetya/Nyetya ransomware that spread in 2017 and older versions of malware used by the BlackEnergy APT group. The researchers noticed similarities between the list of targeted file extensions used by ExPetr and those used by BlackEnergy's destructive "KillDisk" malware in 2015-2016. Through code analysis, they identified some generic code shared between ExPetr and BlackEnergy, such as code for recursively listing files and checking extensions. This code alone is not definitive proof of a link, but is interesting. By combining the generic code snippets with unique strings, the researchers created a YARA rule that matches both ExPetr and BlackEnergy samples specifically. This further indicates some code similarities, though it is still not definitive proof. Kaspersky reached out to the broader security research community for help investigating the potential BlackEnergy-ExPetr link. Other researchers like ESET have also published analyses suggesting possible connections to the TeleBots group linked to BlackEnergy. The researchers conclude that more research is needed to either confirm or disprove a firm link between ExPetr and BlackEnergy. As with cases like WannaCry in the past, more evidence may emerge over time to connect the dots. For now it remains an open investigation.
