The document analyzes a targeted attack campaign called MartyMcFly that was found targeting a major naval defense company in Italy. The attack started with a phishing email containing malicious Excel documents. The Excel documents contained encrypted OLE objects that executed when opened in "read-only" mode using a known default password. This dropped and executed a new PE file from a compromised website. This PE file contained a hidden encrypted Windows PE payload. The nested malware uses multiple stages and evasion techniques like delayed execution based on system date checks. It appears to have been created around 2010 but only recently deployed in 2018 based on VirusTotal submission dates. This suggests an advanced threat actor that planned this naval industry attack years in advance before deploying it. The malware uses multiple stages, encryption, obfuscation, anti-debugging, and other evasion techniques indicating sophistication. While the origins are unclear, it represents a dangerous new threat targeting naval and military defense contractors.
