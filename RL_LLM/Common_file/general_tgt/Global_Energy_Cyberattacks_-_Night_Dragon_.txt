The document analyzes a series of cyberattacks called "Night Dragon" targeting global energy and petrochemical companies starting in late 2009. The attacks originated primarily from China and involved the following: Compromise of company extranet web servers via SQL injection to gain remote access. Upload of hacker tools to pivot further into corporate networks. Cracking of passwords to gain authenticated access to more systems. Disabling of IE proxy settings to allow direct C2 communication. Installation of remote access trojans (RATs) like zwShell for data exfiltration. Focus on operational data like oil field bids and process control systems. The zwShell RAT tool allowed the attackers to build custom malware for victims and control compromised systems. The attacks went undetected for years using basic hacking techniques. Network, registry, and file indicators are provided to detect GlassRAT. McAfee products like Vulnerability Manager, EPO, and Network Security Platform can also identify the threat. Attribution suggests the attacks originated from China based on malware tools, passwords, data exfiltration times, infrastructure, and individuals providing hosting services. The report aims to provide insights to detect and prevent similar future cyber espionage campaigns. In summary, Night Dragon demonstrates advanced persistent threat tactics by nation-state actors against critical infrastructure with the goal of stealing sensitive data.
