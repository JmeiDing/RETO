The document analyzes activity by a suspected Chinese threat actor group called Scarab targeting Ukraine. This represents one of the first public examples of a Chinese group targeting Ukraine since the Russian invasion began. Ukraine's CERT agency disclosed details on an actor dubbed UAC-0026 distributing a RAR file archive containing a malicious executable and DLL. SentinelLabs confirms UAC-0026 is Scarab based on malware similarities and infrastructure reuse. Scarab has been active since at least 2012, targeting various countries. They use phishing lures relevant to targets and custom malware like the Scieron backdoor, which may be a predecessor to the HeaderTip malware. Scarab lure documents contain Chinese language metadata. Recent Ukraine targeting documents mimic Ukraine's national police. HeaderTip malware makes HTTP requests and seems to be an initial infection vector. Infrastructure analysis found Scarab repeatedly uses dynamic DNS services, allowing flexible operations. While their motivations are unclear, targeting Ukraine represents an evolution in Scarab's activities. In summary, a suspected Chinese group called Scarab has been found targeting Ukraine with phishing and custom malware, representing an expansion of their traditional targeting and one of the first Chinese cyber campaigns against Ukraine since the invasion. Their exact motivations remain uncertain.
