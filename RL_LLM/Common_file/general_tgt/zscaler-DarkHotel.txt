The document describes a new attack campaign by the DarkHotel APT group targeting organizations primarily in South Korea. The initial attack vector is a malicious Word document that uses multiple layers and embedded objects to eventually drop and execute a scriptlet file. The scriptlet performs process checks, network spoofing, and drops two binaries. One binary spoofs explorer.exe and performs UAC bypass to execute the other dropped binary. This second binary registers a malicious service for persistence that executes obfuscated PowerShell scripts. The PowerShell scripts contain an encoded .NET payload that connects to command and control servers. The .NET backdoor exfiltrates system info and can download additional modules. The threat actors registered lookalike domains impersonating organizations in China to use in phishing campaigns. They are leveraging interest in cryptocurrencies to create fake wallet sites that trick users into entering their private keys. The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, registry artifacts, and network IOCs. The attack demonstrates this APT group's continued efforts to refine tactics and use spear phishing paired with multi-stage documents and scripts to infect targets and move laterally.
