Trend Micro discovered a new advanced persistent threat (APT) group dubbed Earth Berberoka or GamblingPuppet targeting online gambling sites. The group uses old and new malware on Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms. On Windows, they employ PuppetLoader, a new complex 5-stage malware, as well as updated PlugX, Gh0st RAT, and other downloaders. PuppetLoader utilizes interesting techniques like hijacking legitimate loaded modules and hiding payloads in modified bitmap images. It establishes command and control communication for remote access. Earth Berberoka distributes the malware via fake Adobe Flash updates and other lures. The group appears to have significant infrastructure and capabilities. PlugX and Gh0st RAT malware families have been used in campaigns for over a decade but upgraded versions are leveraged here. The technical analysis examines the functionality of each malware type. Organizations are advised to vet links and emails, use multilayered endpoint and network security, and block threats proactively. Further IOCs and mitigation advice is available in Trend Micro's forthcoming research paper.
