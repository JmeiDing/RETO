The PDF describes campaigns by the Gamaredon APT group, an active threat group since 2013 that typically targets Ukrainian government institutions. Gamaredon has been using COVID-19 themed phishing emails with malicious document attachments in recent campaigns targeting victims in Europe and elsewhere. The infection chain involves a docx file attachment that uses a template injection technique to download a malicious dot template file containing macros. The macros execute a VBScript that decrypts and downloads additional payloads. The campaigns follow typical Gamaredon tactics like using socially relevant lures and targeting government entities, but have added some new technical aspects like obfuscating the VBScript payload. The analysis uncovers infrastructure links between the campaigns, like common IP addresses of Russian hosting providers. Several malicious files, URLs, and IoCs are provided. The campaigns show how threat actors like Gamaredon are opportunistically using the pandemic in social engineering while continuing to refine their technical malware delivery tactics. Recommended mitigations for these kinds of cyber attacks are provided.
