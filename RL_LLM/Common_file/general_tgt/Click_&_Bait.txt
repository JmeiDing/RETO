- The report by Amnesty International describes a campaign of targeted spyware attacks against Vietnamese human rights defenders (HRDs) from February 2018 to November 2020. - The attacks are attributed to a threat actor group called Ocean Lotus, also known as APT32, which has been active since 2014 targeting private companies, NGOs, and HRDs. - Ocean Lotus uses sophisticated Windows and Mac spyware toolkits to monitor and infiltrate target systems. Their attacks align with Vietnamese state interests based on past targeting. - The investigation revealed spyware attacks on two specific Vietnamese HRDs and a human rights organization called VOICE based in Philippines. - The attacks used phishing emails pretending to share important documents, containing spyware downloads or links. If opened, the spyware provided full system access. - The report highlights Vietnam's systemic repression and surveillance of online dissent and activism. The attacks are part of a broader crackdown on freedom of expression. - Targeting HRDs using digital surveillance violates privacy rights and unlawfully restricts freedoms of expression, opinion, association and assembly under international law. - Recommendations include investigating Ocean Lotus links to Vietnamese agencies, enacting surveillance oversight laws, and protecting activists from unlawful surveillance. - The report aims to raise awareness on the threat spyware poses to HRDs globally and the need for better digital security against sophisticated attackers.
