The document describes an attack that leverages a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player to target victims in the Middle East, potentially Qatar. The attack starts with a weaponized Microsoft Office document that remotely loads a malicious Flash file from the attacker's server. The Flash file uses a custom cryptographic system with RSA and AES encryption to protect subsequent stages of the attack and evade detection. After decryption, the Flash exploit triggers to achieve arbitrary code execution with minimal user interaction. The attacker chose to use a zero-day exploit likely due to the higher success rate and lower chance of detection compared to reused exploits. The attack communicates with the attacker's command and control server to download additional payloads. A unique token is used in the requests. The server URLs log data to track the attack's progress. The network traffic shows the document first downloads the initial Flash file, then retrieves the exploit payload, and finally attempts to download a third stage shellcode payload which was not actually served during analysis. The document name contains Arabic text which translates to "Urgent Secret" and references Qatar. This, combined with the targeting of victims in the Middle East, suggests the attack may be aimed at individuals or organizations in Qatar. However, the exact targeting is unclear. Overall, the attack demonstrates the ongoing risk of zero-day Flash exploits embedded in Office documents. It shows an advanced adversary combining multiple techniques like remote Flash delivery, encryption, and zero-day exploits to hinder detection and analysis. Defenses should focus on restricting Flash in Office, monitoring for suspicious Flash activity, and implementing controls to detect and respond to unusual patterns of encryption and network traffic.
