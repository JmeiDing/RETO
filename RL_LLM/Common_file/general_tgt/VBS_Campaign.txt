The document describes a targeted attack campaign affecting the Middle East that uses VBScript, PowerShell, and VBA macros to deploy malware. The campaign starts with a VBScript that generates a PowerShell script. The PowerShell script creates a weaponized Office document containing macros. When opened, the macro creates and executes a Windows Script File (WSF). The WSF file contains the main malware functionality, configured to contact a command and control server, oce-update[.]services. It registers the infected system and retrieves additional payloads, which are obfuscated VBScript functions. The payloads include reconnaissance functions to fingerprint the infected system, persistence functions, and a pivot function to download and execute shellcode from another IP address. The attacker exhibits strong operational security, using CloudFlare to hide infrastructure, filtering on user agents, and only enabling C2 servers briefly. Code analysis shows similarities to the Jenxcus/Houdini malware. Decoy documents pretend to be confidential reports from a Jordanian research institute on regional conflicts. This and other clues suggest the campaign targets individuals with interest in Middle East politics and military affairs. Talos provides IOCs, detection coverage, and recommendations like updating software, blocking scripts, using email security, and building threat intelligence. In summary, the report analyzes an advanced, targeted VBScript malware campaign affecting the Middle East region.
