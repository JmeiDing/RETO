The document analyzes a new zero-day Adobe Flash exploit used by the BlackOasis APT group to deliver FinSpy malware. BlackOasis was first observed by Kaspersky in May 2016 exploiting another Flash zero-day. Since then, they have exploited at least 5 Flash zero-days to deploy FinSpy. This new attack starts with a weaponized Office document containing a malicious Flash object. The Flash exploit triggers a vulnerability that allows arbitrary code execution. It downloads a second stage shellcode that retrieves the FinSpy payload from a command and control server. FinSpy is commercial spyware sold to government agencies for surveillance. Kaspersky was able to connect this attack to previous FinSpy activity by BlackOasis through shared infrastructure. BlackOasis has targeted figures in Middle Eastern politics, opposition activists, journalists, and more in countries like Russia, Iraq, Iran, and Angola. The report highlights the proliferation of commercial surveillance tools and exploits after the HackingTeam breach. Defenses like killbits, whitelisting, AV, and network monitoring can help protect against such targeted attacks. Vendors need to work together to identify and patch vulnerabilities exploited in the wild. In summary, the analysis provides details on the activities and tools of the BlackOasis APT group, focused on exploiting Flash zero-days to deploy FinSpy spyware against high value targets in the Middle East and beyond.
