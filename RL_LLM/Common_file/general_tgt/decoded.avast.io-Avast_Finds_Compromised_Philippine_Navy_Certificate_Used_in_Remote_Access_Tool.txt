Avast Threat Intelligence discovered a remote access trojan (RAT) being used in active attacks in the Philippines. The RAT uses an expired digital certificate belonging to the Philippine Navy that appears to have been compromised. The certificate was valid from December 15, 2019 to December 15, 2020. Avast believes the threat actors likely had access to the private key. The RAT was seen using this certificate still in June 2020 after it had expired. The RAT connects to a command and control server at dost[.]igov-service[.]net over port 8443 using TLS. The certificate is pinned so only this specific certificate can be used. Analysis of the malware shows the compilation timestamp was modified to show 2004, but the version of OpenSSL used was from April 2020. The developer username found was likely "udste." The RAT has capabilities like executing shellcode, reading/writing files, deleting files, and listing drives and directories. The commands are encrypted except for a hard-coded mutex string meant to mimic the Quasar RAT. Avast notified CERT-PH and the Philippine Navy. The navy stated the incident was resolved and no further help was needed. Avast customers are protected from this threat. The key points are that a valid Philippine Navy certificate was compromised and abused to sign malware, the RAT has several malicious capabilities, and Avast worked with Philippine authorities to disclose the findings.
