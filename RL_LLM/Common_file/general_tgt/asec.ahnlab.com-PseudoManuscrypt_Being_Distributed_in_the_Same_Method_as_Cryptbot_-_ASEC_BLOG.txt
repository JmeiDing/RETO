The ASEC analysis team has discovered a new malware called PseudoManuscrypt, which is disguised as an installer similar to Cryptbot and is being distributed through malicious sites. It uses an NSIS installer and 7z SFX executable to extract and execute various malware payloads. The malware is targeting random users in Korea and has been confirmed to infect numerous PCs. PseudoManuscrypt creates shortcut files that execute encoded shellcode saved in the registry. It creates a registry key with a unique MachineGuid value and encodes the "install.dat" data using this value. The malware then injects the decoded "install.dat" into processes that include "-k netsvcs" in their arguments. The shellcode decodes and executes a PE file that performs malicious actions. The PE file checks for svchost processes, injects itself, and creates persistence by registering tmp files as services that decode registry data on restart. It also checks for control signals (5 and 6) and reconfigures its behavior accordingly. The malware can steal various user credentials, access the C2 server under the attacker's command, and perform other malicious behaviors. AhnLab has detected the malware under various detection names starting in May 2021. IOCs and analysis details are available in their threat intelligence platform. Users must be careful not to download relevant programs and perform periodic PC maintenance to prevent the malware from performing continuous malicious behaviors without their knowledge.
