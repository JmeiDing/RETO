The report describes a threat hunting technique focused on detecting the loading of unsigned DLLs, which is a common method used by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups and malware authors to execute payloads while evading detection.Most malicious DLLs are unsigned, written to unprivileged paths, and loaded by signed processes like rundll32.exe using techniques like DLL order hijacking or side-loading. Hunting for unsigned DLL loading revealed activities of sophisticated APTs like the Chinese group Stately Taurus (Mustang Panda) and the North Korean Lazarus Group (Selective Pisces). Stately Taurus used DLL side-loading with legitimate software like PDF readers and antivirus to load payloads like PlugX RAT. Selective Pisces abused DreamSecurity software to load payloads and used DLL side-loading to persist in spoolv.exe. Mass campaigns like Raspberry Robin use rundll32.exe to load high entropy DLLs with scrambled names from ProgramData/AppData. Factors like file paths, entropy, execution frequency, and hijacked process names can help distinguish malicious vs legitimate DLL loading.
