The report details a hacking campaign called Operation Cloud Hopper conducted by a China-based threat actor group known as APT10. The campaign targeted managed IT service providers (MSPs) in multiple countries as a supply chain attack to gain access to their clients' networks and sensitive data. APT10 has been active since at least 2009, initially targeting government, defense, and technology organizations. After their Poison Ivy malware was publicly exposed in 2013, APT10 upgraded their tools, moving to PlugX and expanding their targeting focus. In 2016-2017, APT10 compromised several major MSPs, utilizing their credentials and network access to move laterally and steal data from customer networks. The wide access MSPs have to client systems and data made them an ideal attack vector. Once inside a client network, APT10 used various malware and hacking tools to gather and exfiltrate targeted files. Concurrently, APT10 also directly targeted Japanese entities with spear phishing emails containing custom malware called ChChes. They spoofed government and academic institutions in the phishing messages. APT10 heavily obfuscated their infrastructure and operations. Analysis of IP addresses, domain registrations, malware compile times, and activity patterns aligns with China time zone and shows organizational sophistication. The industries targeted also fit China's strategic economic goals. Overall, the report profiles APT10's tactics, techniques, and procedures, showing how they evolved their malware and operations to increase effectiveness. It also demonstrates supply chain attacks as an emerging cyber threat vector.
