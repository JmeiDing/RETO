The cybercrime group BlueNoroff has adopted new techniques to deliver malware and evade detection. BlueNoroff group is a financially motivated threat actor that has been known to steal cryptocurrency using their cyberattack capabilities. They are using ISO and VHD image files to avoid the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) warning in Windows when opening internet-downloaded files. They also are experimenting with new file types like Visual Basic Script, Windows Batch files, and Windows executables to deploy malware. BlueNoroff typically uses phishing emails with weaponized Office docs or archive files containing malware shortcuts. Recently they've introduced downloaders that fetch the next-stage payload from a command-and-control server. The final payload is similar to malware they've used before. The latest archive files discovered by researchers contain a password-protected decoy document and a shortcut file named "Password.txt.lnk" to persuade victims to execute the malicious shortcut file and acquire the decoy document's password. Analysis uncovered over 70 domains used by BlueNoroff, many impersonating Japanese venture capital and bank websites. This indicates the group's interest in compromising Japanese financial entities. The techniques aim to bypass security measures and avoid detection. They include using legitimate Windows components for execution, injecting code into trusted processes, and disabling antivirus hooks. BlueNoroff remains motivated by financial gain, stealing cryptocurrency worth millions recently. Their ongoing development of new techniques suggests attacks will continue. The report provides indicators of compromise and MITRE ATT&CK mappings for the malware. Defenders should update detections and monitor for the group's latest tradecraft involving scripts, disk images, unconventional files, and proxy execution methods. The adoption of MOTW bypass and targeting of Japan are notable changes to track.
