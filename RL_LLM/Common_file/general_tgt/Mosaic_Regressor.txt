The document provides technical details on a malware framework named MosaicRegressor that is used for espionage and data gathering. MosaicRegressor has been seen installed in victim UEFI firmware for persistence. It uses a leaked HackingTeam bootkit called VectorEDK. It has multiple stages and components. Initial downloaders written in C++ fetch additional modules from command and control servers. The downloaders use BITS jobs, libcurl, WinHTTP API, or check webmail for modules. Email attachments are decrypted DLLs or executables. Downloaded modules collect system info and send it to command servers. Later stages exfiltrate documents and data. Components have varying levels of obfuscation. Strings are Base64 or XOR encoded. Payloads use simple exported functions. There are language artifacts suggesting some developers are of Chinese or Korean origin. Code similarities exist to Gaza Hacker Team. Targets are primarily in the Middle East. Both opportunistic attacks and tailored phishing emails have been observed. Low sophistication but modular design makes MosaicRegressor extensible. Persistence in firmware raises the stakes of infections. While not advanced, the framework's continuing evolution, targeting, and shadowy control indicate an experienced threat actor.
