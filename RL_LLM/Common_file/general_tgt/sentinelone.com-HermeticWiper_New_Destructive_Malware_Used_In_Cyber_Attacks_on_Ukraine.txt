The document analyzes a new destructive malware called HermeticWiper that has been used in cyber attacks against organizations in Ukraine starting on February 23, 2022. HermeticWiper is signed with a suspicious digital certificate issued to "Hermetica Digital Ltd", likely a shell company used by the attackers. The malware abuses a legitimate EaseUS partition management driver to gain direct access to the file system and hard drives. It corrupts the MBR and partitions of drives 0-100, rendering them inoperable. It also manipulates the NTFS Master File Table and may target specific files and logs. HermeticWiper disables crash dumps, initiates a system shutdown, and corrupts the system enough to prevent booting again. This represents an escalation in cyber attacks accompanying Russia's invasion of Ukraine from prior website defacements and DDoS attacks. Researchers across the industry are collaborating to analyze the threat and several IOCs are provided to detect HermeticWiper. In summary, the document details the technical workings of the HermeticWiper malware used to destroy systems in Ukraine and provides indicators to help defend against this new wiper threat.
