Unit 42 researchers found a Trojan delivered through Google Drive using shortened URLs and an actor-controlled redirection server. The attack targets a Myanmar politician and human rights activist with a Zip file containing an executable dropper. The dropper installs the 9002 Trojan through DLL sideloading. The 9002 Trojan communicates with a C2 server and can load plugins provided by the C2. It shares infrastructure with Poison Ivy samples used in attacks on Myanmar and Taiwan. The Poison Ivy samples use similar mutexes, parent processes, and some of the same C2 infrastructure. They target organizations in Taiwan with decoy documents about cross-strait relations. Using Google Drive allows the malware to blend in with legitimate traffic. The shortened URL redirects to an actor-controlled server that hosts a script responsible for redirecting the browser to another location. URL shorteners and redirection servers help obfuscate malicious links. The server parses parameters from inbound HTTP requests and requires certain strings within the base64 encoded data for redirection. The attack also involves a dropper Trojan that saves a decoy and a payload to the system before opening both. The decoy is a PowerPoint presentation containing details of a conference in Myanmar.
