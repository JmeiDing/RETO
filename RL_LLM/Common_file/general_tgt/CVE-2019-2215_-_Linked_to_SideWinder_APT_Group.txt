The PDF analyzes malware apps distributed on Google Play that exploit the CVE-2019-2215 vulnerability and are linked to the SideWinder APT group. Three apps - Camero, FileCrypt Manager, and callCam work together to compromise Android devices. Camero exploits CVE-2019-2215, a use-after-free flaw in Android Binder. This is the first publicly known attack exploiting this vulnerability. The apps use obfuscation, encryption, and other evasion techniques. They collect extensive device and user data and exfiltrate it to command and control servers. SideWinder is conducting these attacks. The group has targeted Windows systems since 2012, but this shows new Android malware capabilities. The apps' infrastructure links them to SideWinder. The apps root devices or abuse accessibility permissions to silently install the malicious callCam. callCam hides its icon and steals sensitive data in the background. The stolen data is encrypted before exfiltration. RSA, AES, SHA256 and other algorithms are used along with a custom encoding routine. Google Play provided the initial infection vector but the apps have been removed. Trend Micro mobile security solutions can detect the malware. Continued monitoring is needed to protect against SideWinder's attacks.
