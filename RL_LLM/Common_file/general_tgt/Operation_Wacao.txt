The document analyzes the tactics, techniques, and procedures of a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group dubbed "Operation Wocao" by Fox-IT researchers. The group gained initial access by exploiting vulnerable web servers and uploading webshells. They moved laterally using stolen credentials and tools like Mimikatz. Custom tools were used like XServer for command and control, Agent for proxying, directory listing tools, keyloggers etc. PowerShell was used to execute scripts and tools. The group heavily focused on discovery, credential access, and collection of documents. Tools enumerated network resources, usernames, sessions, files, etc. Most data was exfiltrated over the XServer C2 channel. Tools like WinRAR were used to compress collected documents before exfil. The group was very consistent in cleaning up traces of their activity by overwriting and deleting files when no longer needed. Attribution to a Chinese group was made based on language settings, timezones, tool code overlap with public Chinese sources, and targeting of foreign govt entities. The report maps the TTPs of the group to the MITRE ATT&CK framework across the attack lifecycle categories of initial access, execution, persistence etc. In summary, the report provides a comprehensive profile of the TTPs of a sophisticated Chinese hacking group targeting foreign government entities for cyber espionage.
