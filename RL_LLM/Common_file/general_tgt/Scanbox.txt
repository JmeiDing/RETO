The document is a tactical intelligence bulletin from PwC dated February 2015 about a reconnaissance framework called ScanBox that has been used in espionage attacks. ScanBox is a JavaScript and PHP framework used by attackers to perform reconnaissance and key logging on compromised websites without requiring malware download or installation. PwC has identified 24 additional websites compromised with ScanBox since their previous report. The ScanBox codebase has remained largely unchanged, but there are subtle differences in some aspects of the code or software attackers choose to search for to evade signatures and identify real machines vs research environments. Software checks within the ScanBox code tend to be for the same original list of filenames, with some attackers customizing the list based on their target region's predominant software providers. The bulletin analyzes 4 previous clusters of ScanBox activity linked to different threat actors: - Cluster 1 (Flash Cluster): Linked to threat actor Deep Panda and believed to be behind Forbes compromise. Targets Uyghurs and overlaps with TH3Bug. - Cluster 2 (Deep Cluster): Linked to Deep Panda/Anthem breach. - Cluster 3 (Mystery Cluster): Unknown actor. - Cluster 4 (Evil Cluster): Linked to Stone Panda and malware EvilGrab/Vidgrab. PwC believes there is a 5th actor now using ScanBox based on differences in implementation. This group sends phishing emails with links to ScanBox sites rather than compromising sites. The report concludes these groups are sharing resources as part of a "digital quartermaster" model as hypothesized by FireEye. The nature of relationships between groups is unclear. Proliferation of ScanBox to new threat actors is a concern.
