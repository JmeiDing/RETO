The report documents an investigation by Citizen Lab into the apparent use of Sandvine/Procera Networks Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) devices to surreptitiously inject malicious content or ads into Internet traffic in Turkey and Egypt. In Turkey, the devices were being used to redirect users attempting to download legitimate Windows programs to versions bundled with spyware associated with the StrongPity APT group. Targets included government critics, Kurdish regions, and Syrian Internet users. In Egypt, a system called AdHose installed on Telecom Egypt's network hijacked users' web connections to redirect them en masse to affiliate ads and browser cryptocurrency mining scripts. AdHose had been operating for years. Extended technical analysis of the injection activities matched them to a fingerprint associated with Sandvine PacketLogic devices. Citizen Lab obtained and tested a PacketLogic device to confirm it could mimic the injections. The report documents how PacketLogic can be configured for regulatory blocking of sites and content. It raises concerns about Sandvine providing such powerful dual-use systems with potential for rights abuses to countries with poor human rights records like Turkey and Egypt. Citizen Lab notified Sandvine and owner Francisco Partners of the issues prior to publication. The companies asserted strong commitment to ethical practices but did not directly address the research findings. Overall, the report illustrates how DPI technology can enable covert attacks and mass surveillance when placed in the wrong hands. It highlights the human rights risks of the unregulated dual-use surveillance industry.
