1. Initial Access - Threat actors send phishing emails with malicious links pretending to be job recruitment messages. 2. Weaponization - The links lead to attacker-controlled sites or compromised legitimate sites hosting hidden iframes that load the exploit kit. 3. Delivery - When targets click the links and visit the sites, the iframes silently trigger the exploit kit in the background. 4. Exploitation - The exploit kit fingerprints the target's browser and OS first. - It then delivers the Chrome exploit (CVE-2022-0609) if the target is on Chrome. - Other exploits may be served if the target is on Safari or Firefox. 5. Installation - If the Chrome exploit is successful, additional JavaScript is loaded to execute the next stage - likely a sandbox escape. 6. Command & Control - The later stages of the exploit kit likely establish command and control to the attacker's infrastructure. 7. Actions on Objectives - The attackers leverage the remote access and persistence gained for espionage and data exfiltration.
