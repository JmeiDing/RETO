The PDF describes malware called OnionDuke that is being spread through malicious Tor exit nodes. When a user downloads an executable file through a compromised Russian Tor exit node, they receive a wrapper executable that contains the original file and a malicious executable. The wrapper executes both files, tricking the user into running the malware while believing the original executable ran normally. The malware is a dropper that decrypts and executes a DLL backdoor which connects to command and control servers. Additional malware components like credential stealers are also downloaded via the backdoor. OnionDuke shares infrastructure links with the MiniDuke APT group, suggesting they are connected despite being separate malware families. OnionDuke has been infecting executables since at least October 2013, and more recently through torrent files. There is evidence OnionDuke has been used in targeted attacks against European government agencies via unknown infection vectors. The malware exhibits a "mass-infection" strategy through modified binaries, contrasting with surgical targeting in the government attacks. The PDF analyzes the OnionDuke malware revealed through malicious Tor exit nodes and its connections to a sophisticated cyberespionage operation.
