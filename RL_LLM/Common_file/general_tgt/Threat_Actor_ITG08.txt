The PDF describes an investigation by IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) into recent attacks by the financially motivated cybercrime group ITG08 (also known as FIN6). ITG08 has been active since 2015 targeting point-of-sale systems and hospitality companies in the US and Europe. The investigation found ITG08 used spear phishing emails with fake job ads to target specific employees and trick them into downloading malware. The main malware used was More_eggs, a backdoor sold on the dark web. Other tools included Metasploit for lateral movement and signed binaries and DLLs to establish persistence. Once initial access was gained, ITG08 moved laterally with Windows tools like WMI and PowerShell. They escalated privileges using Mimikatz and harvested credentials. The group also made heavy use of obfuscation techniques like base64 encoding. Based on the TTPs observed, IBM assesses with high confidence that ITG08 was behind this new campaign. The use of More_eggs and fake job ads links it to previous ITG08 activity reported in 2018-2019. The group continues to evolve, expanding from POS malware to card-not-present fraud. Mitigation tips include user education on phishing, monitoring for ITG08 IOCs and TTPs, controlling Windows tools often abused by attackers, and implementing strong password policies and 2FA. Regular pen testing and incident response exercises also help strengthen defenses.
