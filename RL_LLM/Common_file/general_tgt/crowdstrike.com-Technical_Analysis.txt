In December 2020, a complex supply chain attack against SolarWinds was disclosed, affecting the company's Orion platform used by organizations worldwide. CrowdStrike and another firm are supporting SolarWinds in their investigation and root cause analysis of the events that led to the inclusion of unauthorized malicious code into its build cycle. SUNSPOT is StellarParticle's malware used to insert the SUNBURST backdoor into software builds of the SolarWinds Orion IT management product. SUNSPOT monitors running processes for those involved in compilation of the Orion product and replaces one of the source files to include the SUNBURST backdoor code. The design of SUNSPOT suggests StellarParticle developers invested a lot of effort to ensure the code was properly inserted and remained undetected, prioritizing operational security to avoid revealing their presence in the build environment to SolarWinds developers. SUNSPOT was identified on disk with a filename of taskhostsvc.exe (SHA256 Hash: c45c9bda8db1d470f1fd0dcc346dc449839eb5ce9a948c70369230af0b3ef168), and internally named taskhostw.exe by its developers.
