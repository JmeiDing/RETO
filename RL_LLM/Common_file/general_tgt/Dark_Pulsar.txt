The PDF analyzes a sophisticated cyberespionage malware platform called DarkPulsar. It is made up of two leaked NSA frameworks - FuzzBunch for reconnaissance and initial access, and DanderSpritz for post-exploitation actions on compromised systems. The DarkPulsar implant is a dynamic library that installs the backdoor in the system through exported functions. The backdoor can control authentication processes using various protocols like NTLM, Kerberos, TLS/SSL, Digest, and Negotiate. DarkPulsar is a FuzzBunch plugin that controls a passive backdoor implant named sipauth32.tsp. The implant injects into authentication functions in lsass.exe to hide malicious traffic inside legitimate protocols like SMB and encrypt communications. DarkPulsar allows disabling security features to access protected data and systems without valid credentials. It can also deploy further implants like PeddleCheap for extended control. Researchers were able to recover the previously undisclosed sipauth32.tsp implant based on constants in the DarkPulsar administrative module leaked from the NSA. The backdoor uses fake exports mimicking telephony and security interfaces to gain persistence and inject malicious code. DarkPulsar targets included organizations in sectors like nuclear, telecom, aerospace, and R&D, primarily in Russia, Iran, and Egypt. The modular frameworks demonstrate sophisticated techniques for stealthy control, data exfiltration, and loading further payloads post-compromise. Technical details are provided on DarkPulsar's installation, export hijacking, command handling, and how it bridges FuzzBunch and DanderSpritz. Indicators of compromise and detection methods such as monitoring network traffic and lsass injections are also discussed.
