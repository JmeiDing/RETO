The report provides an analysis of a recent attack attributed to the financially-motivated threat actor group FIN8. FIN8 typically targets financial services and POS systems through "living off the land" techniques that abuse built-in tools like PowerShell. The attack began with the compromise of user accounts, followed by network reconnaissance to gather domain information. The attackers then moved laterally using WMIC for remote code execution to distribute a PowerShell script that downloaded a payload from a FIN8 C2 server. When defenses blocked this, the group pivoted to using Python's Impacket wmiexec module. Once entrenched in the network, the attackers established persistence using WMI event subscriptions. The payloads were PowerShell scripts that decrypted and loaded .NET binaries from WMI objects. These next-stage binaries collected system info and communicated with domains associated with FIN8. Though the full attack was prevented by Bitdefender products, analysis is ongoing on the novel malware samples. Bitdefender assesses that FIN8 is testing and iterating new versions of their BADHATCH malware. Sharing threat intelligence about these early attacks can help bolster defenses across the security community. The report concludes with indicators of compromise and recommendations that financial firms separate POS systems, use layered security defenses, and work closely with vendors to stay on top of emerging financial sector threats like FIN8.
