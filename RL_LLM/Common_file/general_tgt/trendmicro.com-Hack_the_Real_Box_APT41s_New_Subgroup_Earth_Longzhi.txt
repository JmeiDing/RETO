The PDF describes research by Trend Micro on a new subgroup of the advanced persistent threat (APT) group APT41 called Earth Longzhi. Earth Longzhi has been active since 2020 targeting government, infrastructure, healthcare, banking and other industries in Taiwan, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan and Ukraine. The group uses spear-phishing emails to deliver malware, including custom Cobalt Strike loaders like Symatic, CroxLoader, BigpipeLoader and OutLoader. These use encryption and other techniques to evade detection. Earth Longzhi also uses custom hacking tools like all-in-one tools with Mimikatz, PrintNightmare, credential dumping, and security product disabling. By analyzing victimology, shared Cobalt Strike metadata, and code similarities between Earth Longzhi and other APT41 subgroups like Earth Baku and GroupCC, Trend Micro attributes Earth Longzhi as a new subgroup within the APT41 structure. The sharing of tools and TTPs between APT41 subgroups makes attribution more complex. Trend Micro notes that APT41 relies less on custom malware and more on commodity malware like Cobalt Strike. The group develops new loaders and tools focused on bypassing security products at the kernel level. They conclude that tool-based attribution is getting more difficult as groups share tools, requiring a more holistic analysis.
