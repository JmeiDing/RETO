The document analyzes a malicious RTF document targeting Vietnamese government officials. The RTF exploit CVE-2017-11882 to execute shellcode that decrypts and launches a PE file which drops a malicious DLL (RasTls.dll) and legitimate executable (dascgosrky.exe). The legitimate executable is hijacked to load the DLL. Analysis of the infrastructure shows the attack is attributed to a Chinese group called 1937CN, which has previously targeted Vietnam. The domain wonderfulu.impresstravel.ga resolves to an IP hosting other Vietnamese-themed domains used by this group before. The initial shellcode decrypts and executes the PE file EQNEDT32.exe which contains the main malicious functionality. EQNEDT32 drops and executes RasTls.dll and dascgosrky.exe using a custom decryption loop and zlib decompression. Dascgosrky then loads RasTls via DLL hijacking to run the final payload, identified as PlugX RAT. In summary, the document analyzes a 1937CN operation using an exploit RTF to infect Vietnamese officials via multi-stage shellcode and DLL hijacking techniques, attributed through infrastructure links to previous activity by this Chinese threat group.
