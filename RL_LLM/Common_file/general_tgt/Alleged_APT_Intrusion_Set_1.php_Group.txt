The report provides information on an alleged APT group referred to as the "1.php" group that has been active since at least 2008. The group conducts spear-phishing attacks sending emails with malicious PDF attachments or links to binaries containing a Poison Ivy RAT payload. Targets include China/US relations experts, defense entities, and the geospatial industry. Repeated infections of a cleared defense contractor by the group are analyzed. The group uses unique HTTP GET request patterns with XOR encoded system info to check-in with command and control servers registered with Chinese emails. Relationships between the group's infrastructure and previous APT incidents like campaigns against QinetiQ are outlined. Hostnames suggest other government and commercial entities were targeted. Lessons learned include the need for proactive logging and analysis to find anomalies indicative of compromise, correlating incidents and infrastructure to relationships and targets, and responsible disclosure of incident details. The report aims to increase awareness of the group's tactics and infrastructure to improve detection, response, and prevention of similar targeted attacks. Information sharing and collaboration within the security community are encouraged.
