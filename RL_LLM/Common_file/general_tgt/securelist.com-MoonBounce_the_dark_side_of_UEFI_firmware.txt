The report analyzes an advanced persistent threat campaign named MoonBounce that leverages a UEFI firmware rootkit for stealthy and persistent access. The rootkit was found injected into the DXE firmware component responsible for initializing boot services. It intercepts the boot process to propagate malicious code from firmware to kernel and user space. The implant is capable of persisting across disk formatting or replacement due to its location on SPI flash. The rogue UEFI firmware deploys a kernel driver that injects user-mode malware into svchost. This malware reaches out to a command and control server to download additional payloads. The UEFI infection provides persistence across operating system reinstallation or hard drive replacement. MoonBounce was seen along with other malware like ScrambleCross, Microcin, and custom backdoors in the victim network. Infrastructure analysis links the activity to the Chinese-speaking threat actor APT41. The group has continuously developed sophisticated UEFI and supply chain attacks for espionage. The full infection routine leverages multiple stages for stealth, including fileless components operating solely in memory. infection chain itself does not leave any traces on the hard drive, as its components operate in memory only. Technical details are provided on the DXE hooking, boot process hijacking, driver injection, and command and control. Indicators of compromise and Yara rules enable detection and threat hunting. The campaign exemplifies APT41's expertise in UEFI and firmware threats. As vendors improve boot security, attackers are expected to continue innovating in this area. Defenders should update firmware regularly, enable hardware protections like TPM and Secure Boot, and monitor firmware integrity to mitigate advanced persistent threats.
