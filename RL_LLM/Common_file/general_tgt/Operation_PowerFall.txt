The PDF describes an attack called Operation PowerFall that exploited two zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Windows. The attack targeted a South Korean company in May 2020 and was detected and prevented by Kaspersky technologies. The attack used a full exploit chain that consisted of: - A remote code execution exploit for a use-after-free vulnerability in Internet Explorer's JScript engine (CVE-2020-1380). This allowed arbitrary code execution in the context of the browser. - An elevation of privilege exploit for an arbitrary pointer dereference vulnerability in the Windows GDI Print/Print Spooler API (CVE-2020-0986). This allowed escaping the sandbox and executing code in splwow64.exe. The Internet Explorer exploit gained read/write access to the process's memory using corrupted JavaScript objects. It then bypassed Control Flow Guard to execute shellcode that loaded a DLL containing the Windows exploit. The Windows exploit achieved code execution in splwow64.exe with medium integrity. It executed an obfuscated PowerShell command to download a file called upgrader.exe which was prevented by Kaspersky. Kaspersky believes an APT group called DarkHotel may be behind the attack due to similarities with previous exploits, but definitive attribution is not possible. The attack demonstrates 0-day exploits being used in the wild against the latest Windows 10 versions.
