Microsoft observed a new phishing campaign from threat actor NOBELIUM, the group behind the SolarWinds attack. The campaign started in January 2021 and evolved over several waves. The phishing emails contained malicious ISO files delivered via links that were obscured by legitimate mailing service Constant Contact. The ISO files executed malware like Cobalt Strike. Targeting was focused on government, NGOs, IT companies, telecoms, and other organizations across over 150 entities. Attack waves exhibited experimentation with tactics. In May 2021, NOBELIUM escalated attacks, leveraging Constant Contact to send emails posing as USAID alerts containing links to attacker infrastructure and malicious ISO files. The ISO files executed hidden malware to achieve persistence on systems. Microsoft released IOCs from the campaign to help organizations detect activity. Mitigations include enabling antivirus cloud protection, running EDR in block mode, enabling network protection, and requiring multifactor authentication. Microsoft 365 Defender can detect the phishing emails and related malware. The attacks demonstrate NOBELIUM's continued experimentation and high level of sophistication. Microsoft recommends organizations actively monitor for signs of compromise using threat hunting.
