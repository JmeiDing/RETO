The PDF analyzes the recent cyberattack that disrupted Viasat's KA-SAT satellite internet network. It provides technical details based on analysis of firmware from an affected Surfbeam2 modem. The author confirms the attack involved a destructive payload that corrupted the flash memory of modems, rendering them inoperable. This aligns with Viasat's statement on the incident. The author believes the attackers likely abused an application layer management protocol like TR-069 rather than lower level MAC protocols. TR-069 is convenient for this type of attack. Analysis reveals issues with the Surfbeam2 firmware - new firmware is not properly validated and TR-069 enables installing arbitrary binaries without verification. This could have enabled the attackers to deploy the AcidRain wiper malware described by SentinelOne. Several questions remain unanswered like how the VPN appliance was compromised, how the attack propagated across countries over several hours, and whether other malicious code ran on the modems beforehand. The author concludes there are concerning vulnerabilities in the Surfbeam2 firmware that may have been exploited in the attack. More details from Viasat could help clarify the remaining technical unknowns.
