The cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab investigated an attack against a cryptocurrency exchange by the notorious Lazarus hacking group. Lazarus used a new malware variant called AppleJeus to target macOS users in addition to their traditional Windows malware. Lazarus distributed a fake cryptocurrency trading program called Celas Trade Pro. It claimed to be from a legitimate company Celas LLC but was likely a fake company set up by Lazarus. The Windows and Mac versions of Celas Trade Pro contained malware dubbed AppleJeus that infected machines. The malware collected system information and connected to a command and control server run by Lazarus. It downloaded additional malware called Fallchill, which is a Lazarus backdoor for remote control of the machine. Fallchill has been used since at least 2016 in attacks on banks and financial companies. Lazarus continues to target cryptocurrency exchanges and fintech companies. Their expansion into macOS malware indicates they are moving towards more sophisticated supply chain attacks against developers. Companies should not automatically trust third party software and should have security measures in place to detect malware from updates or installations.
