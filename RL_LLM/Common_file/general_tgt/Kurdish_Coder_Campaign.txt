This Trend Micro report analyzes a campaign they are calling "KurdishCoder" involving exploits from the Capesand exploit kit. The malware samples make heavy use of obfuscation tools ConfuserEx and Cassandra/CyaX to evade detection. Capesand exploits like the one delivering njRat use multiple layers of obfuscation. ConfuserEx and Cassandra tools provide fully undetectable capabilities. Analysis of the tools shows ConfuserEx was likely custom built, evident from module properties. CyaX also shows signs of modifications like leaked debug paths. The campaign distributes various payloads like njRat, Agent Tesla, Remcos, and keyloggers. All samples share tactics like the "KurdishCoder" module property. The report hypothesizes the attackers may be using the customized ConfuserEx and Cassandra tools from an obfuscation service like Cassandra Crypter. The combination of tools and consistent campaign indicators point to an active threat actor systematically applying advanced obfuscation to avoid detection, while delivering multiple malware families through Capesand and other means. Trend Micro is continuing monitoring for further developments around the KurdishCoder activity. The use of evasive malware and exploit kits highlights the challenges defenders face.
