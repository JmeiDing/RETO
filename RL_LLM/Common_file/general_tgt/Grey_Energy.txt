The document analyzes a cyberespionage threat actor dubbed GreyEnergy, which ESET researchers have been tracking for 3 years targeting critical infrastructure in Ukraine and Poland. GreyEnergy is assessed to be the successor group to the notorious BlackEnergy APT group behind several disruptive attacks on Ukraine's power grid. Links are based on technical indicators like code similarities in the modular malware frameworks. Notable aspects of GreyEnergy: Targets energy companies, ICS/SCADA systems, and other high-value targets. Focuses on stealthy espionage versus overt disruption. Uses spearphishing and web compromises to gain initial access. Moves laterally once inside networks. Encrypts modules and operates fileless in memory to avoid detection. Wipes artifacts from victim systems. Leverages Tor for command and control infrastructure. Reuses infrastructure linked to BlackEnergy. Deployed early version of NotPetya ransomware before its infamous 2017 outbreak. More evidence of links to TeleBots. Signed malware samples with stolen digital certificates to appear legitimate. The research reveals an active, capable, and stealthy threat actor likely preparing for future cybersabotage operations in eastern Europe against critical infrastructure.
