The PDF describes an analysis by Check Point Research of recent cyberattacks against Iranian targets, including Iran's railway system and the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development. The attacks involved malicious software that displayed fake delay messages on station information boards and wiped systems. Check Point's investigation found similarities between these attacks and previous unclaimed attacks on Syrian companies in 2019-2020. All the attacks used a custom wiper malware dubbed Meteor, Stardust, or Comet in different versions. The PDF provides technical details on how the malware works to corrupt systems. The earlier attacks on Syrian companies were claimed by a group calling itself Indra. Indra has an online presence and claimed responsibility for attacks on Syrian companies it accused of ties to Iran's Quds Force. While Indra did not claim the recent Iran attacks, Check Point believes they are responsible based on similarities in target selection, tactics, and the custom malware used. The report concludes that non-state actors have the capability to conduct sophisticated and highly disruptive attacks previously assumed to be solely in the realm of state-sponsored groups. It warns that as non-state groups become more advanced, equivalent attacks could occur anywhere globally.
