The report analyzes a multi-stage APT attack that starts with a malicious Word resume document distributing a .NET loader malware that used template injection to drop a .Net Loader. The loader decrypts and executes a file that uses Cobalt Strike's Malleable C2 feature to blend in command and control traffic. This allows the malware to download the final Cobalt Strike payload from a remote server. The attack shows several clever evasion techniques. The Word document's macro is set to delay execution until the victim reboots their machine. The shellcode loader runs solely in memory without writing files to disk. The malleable C2 mimics jQuery traffic over HTTPS. Attribution is still uncertain but may be a Chinese group. After initial infection via the boobytrapped resume, the attack progresses through multiple stages: 1. The document macro drops an executable, configuration file, and shortcut for persistence. 2. The .NET loader app checks the victim's country and decrypts/executes the next stage shellcode. 3. The shellcode uses Cobalt Strike's Malleable C2 to conceal C2 traffic as jQuery, downloading the final payload. 4. The executable payload allows the attackers to control the victim system via Cobalt Strike beacons. This attack exemplifies how advanced adversaries chain together evasive techniques to deliver malware while avoiding detection. Understanding this progression helps defenders catch and disrupt the attack at different points along the kill chain.
