The PDF discusses how cybercriminals are increasingly abusing collaboration platforms like Discord and Slack to distribute malware and carry out attacks. As more companies have shifted to telework and rely on these platforms, attackers see an opportunity to bypass security controls by using the legitimate infrastructure. The PDF examines how Discord, Slack, and similar platforms are being abused across three stages of malware attacks: - Delivery: Malware is distributed by uploading payloads to the platform's content delivery network (CDN) and sending links in emails/chats. The encrypted HTTPS hosting and compression obfuscation make it an appealing option. - Component Retrieval: The CDNs are used to host additional malware components or modules that are downloaded as part of a multi-stage infection process. For example, initial Word docs retrieve the next payload from Discord. - Command and Control: Features like webhooks allow malware to communicate with attacker control servers, send system info/data, and receive commands. RATs, ransomware, and other malware leverage Discord APIs. The report also discusses how attackers steal Discord account tokens to impersonate users and remain anonymous. Overall, the abuse of collaboration platforms is increasing as attackers adapt tactics to telework changes and leverage trusted infrastructure to evade defenses. Defenders need to assess risks of allowed apps and consider blocking high-risk domains.
