The report analyzes the resurgence of a cybercrime campaign called ShadowGate, which is using an upgraded version of its custom exploit kit, Greenflash Sundown, to infect victims worldwide with cryptocurrency mining malware. ShadowGate was active since 2015 but restricted operations after a takedown in 2016. It recently resumed attacks using compromised ad servers to redirect visitors to the Greenflash Sundown exploit kit. Greenflash Sundown has added encryption mechanisms and an evasion technique to collect victim system profiles before delivering payloads, allowing more targeted infections. It continues integrating new exploits like those for recent Flash vulnerabilities. The encryption uses public key cryptography but contains a flaw allowing offline decryption of payloads. The victim profiling helps avoid detection by security sandboxes. Attacks have expanded from primarily Asian targets to global victims across countries like the U.S. The exploit kit drops Monero cryptocurrency miners after infection. The report provides technical analysis of the new exploit kit capabilities and how its operators are refining techniques for evasion, targeting, and delivering payloads. It demonstrates ShadowGate's continued development of cybercrime tools and infrastructure despite previous disruptions. Recommendations include keeping software updated, using multilayered security, and deploying vulnerability shielding to mitigate such threats.
