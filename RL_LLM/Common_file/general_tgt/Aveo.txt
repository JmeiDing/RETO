Aveo is a type of malware that specifically targets Japanese-speaking users. It spreads by masquerading as an Excel document and removing the original file path at runtime. Aveo is distributed as an Excel document but is a self-extracting archive dropping a decoy document and the malware. It exfiltrates system information and can accept commands from its command and control server. Aveo shares code similarities with FormerFirstRAT which also targeted Japanese users. Once the victim information is extracted, it is sent to a remote server via HTTP. The command and control domain was registered with a disposable email address. Aveo also has C2 capabilities that can execute commands, get file attributes, write files, read files, and list drives. Additionally, Aveo shares many characteristics with other malware families such as FormerFirstRAT, including encryption routines, code reuse, and similar C2 capabilities.
