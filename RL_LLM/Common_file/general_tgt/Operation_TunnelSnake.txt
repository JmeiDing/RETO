The document analyzes a cyberespionage operation called Operation TunnelSnake that targeted several organizations in Asia and Africa. The operation involved a sophisticated rootkit malware named Moriya and other tools. The Moriya rootkit was used to infect public-facing servers and create a covert command and control channel to silently control them. It was detected on networks of regional diplomatic organizations since October 2019. Moriya has a kernel mode driver component that intercepts packets and filters out malicious traffic marked with a "magic value". This allows it to receive commands from the attacker while staying hidden. The rootkit was deployed by first hacking servers using vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-7269. The attackers then installed Moriya remotely using tools like China Chopper webshell. Moriya provided the attacker remote shell access, command execution, file exfiltration capabilities on the victim's network. The attacker used additional custom and open source tools for network discovery, lateral movement, and data exfiltration after gaining access. Tools like BOUNCER, Earthworm, Termite were observed. An older version of the rootkit called IISSpy with similar code was found dating back to 2018, indicating the threat actor has been active for years. The targeting of diplomatic and regional organizations points to a likely Chinese-speaking threat actor behind the campaign, based on tactics, tools, and procedures analysis. In summary, Operation TunnelSnake was a highly targeted and stealthy attack campaign relying on a custom rootkit, C2, and exfiltration tools to infiltrate select organizations silently and steal data.
