The report from enSilo analyzes a new stealthy malware called Furtim discovered in the wild. Furtim takes extensive measures to avoid detection and analysis: It checks for over 400 security products and virtual environments before installing. It blocks access to security sites and disables Windows notifications and popups. Unique machine info is sent to the C2 so payloads are only delivered once. Sleep and hibernation are disabled to maintain C2 connectivity. Three payloads were observed: A power configuration tool to keep the machine always on. Pony Stealer credential theft malware. An unknown payload that checks for security processes. Furtim's developers prioritized stealth over spreading widely. While attribution is unclear, clues point to Russian threat actors potentially conducting targeted attacks. Furtim exemplifies sophisticated evasion techniques used by advanced adversaries. The report recommends a real-time approach to cut malicious communications before damage can be done once such malware inevitably infiltrates a system.
