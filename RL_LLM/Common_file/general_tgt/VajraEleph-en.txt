In February 2022, the mobile security team at Qi'anxin Virus Response Center noticed that since June 2021, an APT group has been carrying out organized, planned, and targeted military espionage activities against Pakistani and Tanzanian military personnel. This APT group, named VajraEleph by Qi'anxin, has affected dozens of Pakistani military personnel over 9 months, mainly from the Pakistani border guards (FC) and special forces (SSG). A small number of FBI and police personnel were also targeted. VajraEleph uses social platforms to find targets, sending them malicious chat apps through links or images. The apps were hosted on domains registered in the last year. Once installed, the custom Android spyware VajraSpy exfiltrated data like contacts, SMS, files, and WhatsApp info. Analysis of the group's language, phone numbers, and links to other APTs indicates VajraEleph has a background with a regional South Asian government and is conducting cyber espionage against Pakistani military and intelligence. Qi'anxin makes several recommendations: separate work and personal devices, educate staff on security, update software, use security software, and build threat intelligence capabilities. Qi'anxin products can help detect such advanced attacks. In summary, VajraEleph is a new, independent APT conducting cyber espionage against the Pakistani military using social engineering and custom Android malware since mid-2021. Its activities and sponsor point to an association with a regional South Asian government.
