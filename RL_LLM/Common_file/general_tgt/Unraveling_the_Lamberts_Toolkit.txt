The report describes a sophisticated cyberespionage toolkit called The Lamberts used by an advanced threat actor since at least 2008. The toolkit includes various generations of modular Windows and OS X backdoors. The Lamberts toolkit first came to light in 2014 when FireEye discovered the Black Lambert malware using a Windows TTF zero-day exploit. White Lambert is a passive network-driven backdoor that decrypts special packets to extract commands. Blue Lambert appears to be second-stage malware and contains version numbers and codenames referring to victims. Green Lambert is an older but more reliable version of Blue. Pink Lambert is a suite of tools for beaconing, USB exfiltration, and multi-platform orchestration that shares infrastructure with White Lambert. Gray Lambert is the latest passive network backdoor running in user-mode. Codenames in the malware like FLASH GORDON, FUNNELCAKE, SPOCK, and APE ESCAPE reference pop culture, games, and anime. This is highly unusual for advanced threat groups. Attacks leverage sophisticated techniques like signed driver exploits to load kernels, avoid writing to disk, and sniff network traffic. The Lamberts toolkit is comparable to others like Regin, Equation, and ProjectSauron. The report provides a timeline of activity from 2008-2016 based on infrastructure analysis. Most activity was seen in 2013-2014. The threat actor behind The Lamberts has very good opsec, with few mistakes made.
