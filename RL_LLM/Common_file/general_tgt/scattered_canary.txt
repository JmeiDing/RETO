The report provides an in-depth look at a West African cybercriminal organization named Scattered Canary. It details how the group evolved over 11 years, starting from small-scale Craigslist scams into a major business email compromise (BEC) operation. The group's founder, Alpha, started with Craigslist scams under the mentorship of Omega. He branched into romance scams around 2010, learning how to recruit "mules" to move money. In 2015, Alpha partnered with Beta and shifted to targeting businesses, pivoting into BEC attacks. BEC attacks usually start with emails that contain links or attachments that induce victims to provide personal or banking details. Scattered Canary uses a variety of templates and formats to send BEC attack emails to improve efficiency and reduce the risk of detection. The group targets mainly businesses, especially those senior executives who have a lot of financial information. BEC attacks not only cause losses to individual users, but also pose a threat to the entire enterprise and economic system, because it may lead to the loss of millions of dollars in funds. Scattered Canary grew rapidly, adding over 30 associates to help with various scams. They used phishing kits, bank accounts of romance scam victims, VPNs, and burner phones to facilitate their fraud. The group diversified into tax fraud, payroll diversion, and other schemes while continuing BEC operations. By 2017, Scattered Canary had specialized roles and infrastructure to scale up their activities. They targeted government agencies for things like tax refund fraud. Recently, they focus on BEC payroll diversion using prepaid debit cards. The report highlights how Scattered Canary runs multiple scam types simultaneously, showing connections in the cybercrime ecosystem. It emphasizes the need to combat email fraud holistically based on threat actor identities, not just specific scam types like BEC. Understanding the relationships between scams and actors is key to disrupting cybercriminal enterprises.
