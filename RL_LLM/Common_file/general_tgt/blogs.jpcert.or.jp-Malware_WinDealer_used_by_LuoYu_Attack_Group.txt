The PDF document describes malware called WinDealer that is used by a threat actor group named LuoYu to target organizations in Korea and Japan since 2014. WinDealer steals information from infected computers and sends it to command and control (C2) servers. When executed, WinDealer reads configuration data from files in C:\ProgramData. It communicates with C2 servers specified in the configuration or random IP addresses if no C2 is configured. It sends an encrypted AES key to the C2, then uses that key to encrypt stolen data before sending it to the C2. WinDealer loads a DLL module from encoded data in its own executable file. This module steals data like files from USB drives, files from folders like Documents and Desktop, keyboard logs, and browser cookies. The stolen data is saved in folders under %TEMP% as .t files, encoded, then consolidated into .a files. WinDealer monitors these .a files, encrypts them, and sends them to the C2. The C2 can send commands to execute processes, delete files, write registry keys for persistence, and more. The report analyses the network communication and data formats used by WinDealer. It also provides indicators of compromise like file hashes and C2 IP addresses. In summary, the report provides a detailed analysis of the WinDealer malware, its configuration, C2 communication, data stealing capabilities, and related IOCs. This provides defenders with insight into the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by the LuoYu group in its cyber espionage operations.
