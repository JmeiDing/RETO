The document provides an overview and analysis of the Waterbug cyberespionage group. Waterbug is believed to be a state-sponsored group that has been systematically targeting government and embassy entities since at least 2005. Waterbug uses highly-targeted spear phishing emails and watering hole attacks to infect victims' computers with malware like Trojan.Wipbot and Trojan.Turla. Once infected, the malware allows persistent monitoring and data exfiltration capabilities. The document analyzes Waterbug's tactics, including exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, using stolen certificates to sign malware, and operating a sophisticated watering hole network called Venom to fingerprint and infect visitors. Venom has compromised over 80 websites, many government-related, to target potential victims. It also provides a technical analysis of the custom Trojan.Turla malware and its evolution over time into newer variants like Carbon and SAV. Turla is a sophisticated, extensible spyware platform tailored for long-term monitoring. The malware shares code and infrastructure with the BTZ espionage malware discovered in 2008. In addition to the analysis, the document contains indicators of compromise, YARA rules, and other guidance to detect and prevent Waterbug's tools and tactics. It concludes that Waterbug is a highly capable group that has made a significant investment in its malware tools over many years and continues to actively target government entities worldwide.
