The report describes recent attack activities by a threat actor group called Sidewinder or APT-C-17. Sidewinder has been active since 2012, targeting countries like Pakistan, China, Afghanistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. Their goals are stealing confidential information from government, military and academic organizations. - Recent attacks were observed using spearphishing emails with document attachments impersonating Pakistan military and academic institutions. - The documents contained no macros, but used remote template injection to download an RTF file that exploits CVE-2017-11882 to execute malicious payloads. - The payload downloads and executes a JavaScript file generated by the DotNetToJScript tool. This JavaScript decrypts and loads a .NET DLL, which downloads another JavaScript file from a command and control server. - The second JavaScript reflects a remote access trojan DLL that opens a backdoor. This allows the attacker to remotely execute commands on the victim's machine. - In other cases, the RAT payload was configured to bypass Windows 10's anti-malware scan interface to avoid detection. - Infrastructure and payload links show Sidewinder continues to use similar tactics, techniques and procedures in attacks, even after disclosure. - The report summarizes that Sidewinder relies on realistic social engineering lures and heavily obfuscates its malicious payloads to operate stealthily. Organizations are advised to avoid opening suspicious attachments and update systems to block known malware.
