The report by cybersecurity firm Group-IB details the return of the Russian-speaking ransomware gang OldGremlin, which had been inactive for over a year. OldGremlin is one of the few Russian groups that attacks Russian companies, violating the unspoken rule against domestic attacks. Since 2020, the group has conducted 13 phishing campaigns targeting sectors like finance, industry, healthcare in Russia. In March 2022, OldGremlin resumed attacks with two new campaigns using fake emails related to sanctions on Russia. The emails contained links to malicious ISO images and documents that installed the custom malware TinyFluff on compromised systems. TinyFluff is a sophisticated backdoor that uses DNS tunneling for command and control. Group-IB analyzed two versions of TinyFluff used in the attacks. The tools gather system info, steal files, proxy traffic, and run arbitrary commands from the attackers. While the first version was raw, the second more advanced one used domain generation algorithms, encryption, and other tactics. The report also examines the kill chain, commands, and infrastructure used in the campaigns. Overall, OldGremlin has upgraded its tactics, leveraging current events in carefully crafted phishing emails. Group-IB assesses that the recent attacks likely infected many organizations and the group will slowly move through networks undetected before deploying ransomware. The report aims to raise awareness of the group's latest TTPs mapped to MITRE ATT&CK to help organizations enhance defenses.
