The PDF document describes the activities of a threat actor group called DeathStalker. DeathStalker is believed to be a mercenary hacking group that offers hacking-for-hire services and acts as an information broker in financial circles. The group primarily uses spear-phishing emails containing LNK files that execute convoluted infection chains leading to the installation of Powersing malware on victims' machines. Powersing is a PowerShell-based backdoor that can take screenshots and execute arbitrary PowerShell scripts provided by the command and control server. Researchers were able to connect Powersing to two other malware families - Janicab and Evilnum - based on similarities in infection vectors, use of dead drop resolvers, IP address encoding schemes, and code overlaps. This suggests these three malware families were likely developed by the same group. DeathStalker appears to target private companies in the financial sector like law firms, wealth management firms, and fintech companies. Victims have been identified across several countries, but geography doesn't seem to limit their targeting. The group is believed to choose targets purely based on perceived value. The report concludes that groups like DeathStalker represent the kind of threat most companies are likely to face, rather than sophisticated state-sponsored threats. Defenders are advised to monitor use of scripting languages like PowerShell and disable them where possible. The report aims to raise awareness of threats posed by skilled individuals/small groups.
