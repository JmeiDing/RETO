The document provides a technical analysis of the Pegasus spyware created by NSO Group. Pegasus is a sophisticated mobile attack toolkit that can infect iOS and Android devices. It utilizes three zero-day exploits collectively called Trident to jailbreak devices and install the spyware persistently. The exploits target vulnerabilities in Safari Webkit (CVE-2016-4655), the iOS kernel (CVE-2016-4656, CVE-2016-4657), and a developer tool called jsc. Once installed, Pegasus can exfiltrate messages, calls, emails, logs from apps like Gmail, Facebook, Skype, Telegram, and WhatsApp. It can capture passwords, WiFi credentials, router passwords, GPS location, contacts, and calendar data. The spyware hooks into apps to spy on communications before encryption is applied. Pegasus uses advanced obfuscation, encryption, and stealth techniques to avoid detection. It monitors the device state and can self-destruct if it detects threats to its existence. The software is professionally developed with clean, modular code. The report concludes Pegasus is one of the most sophisticated mobile spyware encountered given its evasion abilities, modules for exfiltrating data, and real-time monitoring/recording of users. Defenders should block associated command and control infrastructure.
