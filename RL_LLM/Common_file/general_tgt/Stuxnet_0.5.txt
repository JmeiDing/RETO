The document analyzes Stuxnet 0.5, the earliest known version of the Stuxnet malware discovered in 2007. Stuxnet 0.5 spread only through infected Siemens Step 7 project files and had limited command and control capabilities compared to later versions. It targeted Siemens 417 PLCs at uranium enrichment facilities, likely Natanz in Iran. Stuxnet 0.5 fingerprinted the industrial control system by parsing human-designated symbol labels of devices. It then constructed a special data block DB8061 used to attack the system. The attack involved replaying normal input signals while modifying output signals to close valves controlling uranium hexafluoride gas flow through centrifuges. This was intended to cause excessive gas pressure and damage centrifuges. Later Stuxnet versions switched to attacking centrifuge speeds rather than valves, suggesting the valve attack in 0.5 failed or did not fully achieve its goals. 0.5 shows Stuxnet originally developed a PLC attack on valves before evolving toward its more aggressive and stealthy form targeting centrifuge speeds in 2009-2010. Stuxnet 0.5 provides the missing link in understanding Stuxnet's origins, early strategy, and development process.
