The PDF describes a cyberespionage operation called Operation Oceansalt that has targeted South Korea, the United States, and Canada. The attackers use a custom malware implant named Oceansalt that shares code with a 2010 implant called Seasalt used by the Chinese state-sponsored hacker group Comment Crew. The Oceansalt malware is delivered via spear phishing using weaponized documents with macros that download the implant. Oceansalt has capabilities for reconnaissance, remote command execution, and data exfiltration. It connects to command and control servers in several countries. The report attributes Oceansalt to an unidentified threat actor that somehow obtained access to the Seasalt source code from Comment Crew. After years of inactivity, this code reappeared reused in the Oceansalt malware, raising questions about whether Comment Crew is involved or if code was leaked. The targets include government, military, financial, agriculture, and technology organizations. The objective appears to be espionage and data theft rather than financial gain. The report provides IOCs, malware analysis, and recommendations for security controls like spear phishing protections, web filtering, and adaptable endpoint malware detection.
