The PDF provides an analysis of a cyberespionage campaign called Operation Desert Eagle conducted by a politically-motivated threat group known as Molerats or the Gaza cybergang. The attackers used spear-phishing emails containing weaponized documents purporting to be news articles of interest. When opened, the documents installed a remote access trojan on the victim's system. The malware communicates with command and control servers through DNS requests and encoded beacons to identify victims and receive commands. It also obscures its presence through obfuscation techniques and hiding in registry keys. Researchers uncovered overlaps in infrastructure with previous Molerats campaigns, indicating this is likely the same group. Specific indicators of compromise are provided, including IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, and patterns in network traffic. The targeting aligns with the group's politically-motivated origins, as decoy documents refer to Middle East affairs. By revealing the tactics, techniques, and procedures used in this campaign, the analysis aims to help organizations enhance defenses and attribution.
