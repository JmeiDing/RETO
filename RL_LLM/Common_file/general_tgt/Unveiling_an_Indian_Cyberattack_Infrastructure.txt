The report unveils a cyberattack infrastructure originating from India that has been active for over 3 years, conducting espionage campaigns against political, business, and security targets worldwide. The investigation began when Norwegian telecom Telenor was compromised via a phishing attack. This revealed the use of a decade-old malware family called Infy and uncovered a large infrastructure of domains, IP addresses, and additional custom malware tools. Detailed analysis links these attacks to a threat actor group operating out of India. Tactics include spear-phishing emails with malware, social engineering using documents tailored to targets, and exploitation of vulnerabilities in documents. Custom malware like the Hanove information stealers are used to harvest documents and data from infected systems. There are indications the activity may be state-sponsored, with a focus on targets like Pakistan government, military, and critical infrastructure. Other targets detected include Chinese academics, businesses in the UK and Indonesia, and political independence movements within India. The report concludes that organizations today should expect to be compromised and have response plans in place. Attackers rely on basic tactics but are persistent and invest time in tailored social engineering for high-value targets.
