The cybersecurity company SentinelOne has identified new malicious activity targeting Ukraine that they attribute to the threat actor group known as UAC-0056, also referred to as SaintBear, UNC2589, and TA471. This activity centers around a Python-compiled binary that masquerades as Ukrainian language translation software. SentinelOne assesses that UAC-0056's activity involving the malware strains GrimPlant and GraphSteel began in early February 2022, while preparation began as early as December 2021. The translation software "dictionary-translator.exe" was first uploaded to VirusTotal on February 11, 2022. When launched, it drops and executes four malicious files that match the names, paths, and functionality described in a report by the Ukrainian CERT agency. The GraphSteel variant runs reconnaissance commands to harvest credentials and achieves persistence by setting a run key in the registry to execute its downloader at logon. It attempts to connect to a command and control server at a specific IP address. UAC-0056 has a history of targeting Ukraine and was likely behind the WhisperGate wiper malware that impacted Ukrainian government agencies in January 2022. SentinelOne believes the actor was building infrastructure for this campaign starting in December 2021. In summary, the report details a new wave of cyberattacks attributed to an advanced persistent threat actor targeting Ukraine with malware disguised as translation software, demonstrating an ongoing campaign likely aimed at government and critical infrastructure.
