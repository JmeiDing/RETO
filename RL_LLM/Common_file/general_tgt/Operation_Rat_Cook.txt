The PDF describes a spearphishing campaign distributing a remote access trojan (RAT) called 9002 or DeputyDog. The attackers sent emails with Game of Thrones lures containing malicious Word docs. The docs have embedded shortcuts that execute PowerShell scripts to download and install the 9002 RAT. 9002 provides extensive surveillance capabilities like keylogging, webcam access, and remote shell. It uses HTTP and fake SSL for command and control. The traffic uses custom encoding algorithms in addition to XOR and base64. The campaign shares technical overlaps with previous 9002 activity by a suspected Chinese group called DeputyDog or APT17. Similarities include payload, file names, volume serial numbers, themes, and old IP/domains. A campaign in 2014 also distributed 9002 RAT via similar shortcut link files. That campaign targeted Asia and resembled APT17. The latest campaign started around July 2017 and remains ongoing. The report provides indicators of compromise including C2 domains/IPs, malware hashes, and Yara rules. Defenses should focus on detecting delivery documents, monitoring for C2 traffic, and disabling PowerShell. With numerous technical overlaps, the campaign is likely conducted by a Chinese group known for using 9002 RAT over the years.
