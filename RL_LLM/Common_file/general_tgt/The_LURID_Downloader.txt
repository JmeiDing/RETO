The document describes research into a targeted malware campaign called "Lurid Downloader" or "Enfal" that has compromised over 1465 computers across 61 countries, primarily in Russia and other CIS states. - The attackers send socially engineered emails with malicious PDF attachments that install malware on target systems if opened. The malware then connects to attacker-controlled command and control servers. - The malware allows the attackers full remote control over compromised systems to exfiltrate data. It can upload/download files, execute commands, activate remote shells, etc. - 15 domain names make up the command and control infrastructure, registered by emails traced to China. The servers are spread across IP addresses in the US and UK. - Over 300 specifically coded malware campaigns were tracked, with victims concentrated in particular countries. 60% of campaigns infected only 1-2 targets, indicating precise targeting. - Victims identified include government, diplomatic, military, research, and space-related organizations primarily in Russia/CIS states. Some EU, US, China victims found too. - Campaign codes and command data indicate the attackers sought files related to government, technology and research activities. The isolated regional targeting suggests political motives. - While attribution is unclear, the malware code contains Chinese language project paths. Enfal malware historically tied to Chinese actors. The attack vector analyzed targeted Tibet. In summary, a sophisticated, targeted malware operation precisely compromised sensitive organizations in specific regions, likely for cyberespionage purposes. Industry collaboration is needed to detect and mitigate such threats.
