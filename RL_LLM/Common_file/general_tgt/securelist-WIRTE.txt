The PDF describes research by Kaspersky on a threat actor group named WIRTE that has been active since at least 2019 targeting entities in the Middle East. WIRTE uses spearphishing emails containing Excel spreadsheets or Word docs that drop a VBS malware implant. The implant collects system info and can execute arbitrary commands from the attacker. It uses hidden Excel formulas and macros to evade detection and achieve persistence using registry modifications. A secondary PowerShell script connects to command and control servers to receive additional commands. WIRTE customizes decoy documents to mimic themes relevant to the target. Infrastructure analysis uncovered hosting in Ukraine and Estonia along with 75+ infections across finance, government, military, and tech sectors. Targets are primarily located in the Middle East. WIRTE exhibits similarities to the Gaza Cybergang group based on VBS/PowerShell malware, focus on Palestinian matters in decoys, and usage of Cloudflare on C2 servers. The report concludes WIRTE has operated quietly since 2019 using simple "living off the land" techniques for long-term surveillance. Indicators of compromise are provided. Kaspersky expects WIRTE operations to continue and evolve. Protection requires updated behavioral detection and threat intelligence given the use of common administration tools like Excel, Word, PowerShell for stealthy attacks.
