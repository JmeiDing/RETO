The report analyzes LoJax, which is malware created by the threat group Sednit (also known as APT28, Fancy Bear). LoJax leverages an old anti-theft software called LoJack/Computrace, which has a UEFI/BIOS persistence module. The malware exists in several stages - a trojanized version of the LoJack agent, a UEFI module called SecDxe, and final payloads. The trojanized LoJack agent contacts attacker infrastructure instead of Absolute Software. Researchers discovered tools to read, modify, and write back UEFI firmware in order to install SecDxe. This malicious DXE driver runs early in the boot process and drops the later-stage payloads before Windows starts. SecDxe uses a modified version of Hacking Team's leaked UEFI NTFS driver to write the final payloads (rpcnetp.exe and autoche.exe) to the Windows partition. It also modifies a registry key to run autoche instead of the legitimate autochk. Autoche sets up persistence for rpcnetp, the LoJax agent. Rpcnetp has remote access capabilities and contacts the attacker's servers. The report provides IOCs for multiple versions of the agent and C2 infrastructure. In summary, LoJax demonstrates Sednit's ability to compromise even low-level firmware like UEFI to gain persistence on systems. The report provides both an in-depth analysis of the malware's operation and detection guidance for the threat.
