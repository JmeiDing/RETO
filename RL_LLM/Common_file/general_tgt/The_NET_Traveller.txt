The document provides technical analysis of a malware family called NetTraveler, also known as TravNet. NetTraveler is a cyberespionage tool used by threat actors to exfiltrate data from victims. It has been active since at least 2005, with most samples seen between 2010-2013. The primary attack vector is spearphishing emails with weaponized Office documents that exploit known vulnerabilities like CVE-2012-0158. When opened, NetTraveler is installed and phones home to a command and control server. It collects system information and receives configurations from the C&C. A custom compression algorithm is used to exfiltrate documents, keylogs, and other files. Analysis of the C&C infrastructure reveals organized operations with geo-specific victim targeting and proxy servers to avoid detection. Logs show over 350 victims across 40 countries, with a focus on Mongolia, Russia, and India. Custom versions target specific industries like oil to collect CAD and engineering files. NetTraveler works together with other malware like ZeGost and Saker (Xbox). Saker has remote access capabilities like file management, command execution, and downloading additional modules. It uses simple string obfuscation and steals system info to send to its C&C server. While the malware itself is unsophisticated, NetTraveler continues to successfully compromise high-value targets, likely for espionage purposes. Recommended defenses include blocking malicious attachments, monitoring outbound connections, and threat intelligence sharing to counter this persistent threat.
