The cybersecurity firm Volexity discovered that the website of the Daily NK, a South Korean online newspaper focusing on North Korea, was compromised in a strategic web compromise (SWC) attack from late March to early June 2021. The attackers injected malicious JavaScript code into legitimate JavaScript files on the Daily NK website. This code redirected visitors to malicious subdomains on jquery[.]services that served browser exploits. Two exploits were observed - CVE-2020-1380 targeting Internet Explorer and CVE-2021-26411 targeting IE and legacy Microsoft Edge. Successful exploitation led to a Cobalt Strike payload being executed. In another instance, the subdomain hosted a custom malware called BLUELIGHT. This malware used the Microsoft Graph API for command and control. It gathered system reconnaissance, uploaded files, and could execute commands downloaded from the C2 server. Volexity attributes this activity to a threat actor they track as InkySquid, which aligns with publicly known groups ScarCruft and APT37. The attackers leveraged recently patched browser exploits that would only impact a limited number of users, but could avoid detection through clever obfuscation and using unique custom malware.
