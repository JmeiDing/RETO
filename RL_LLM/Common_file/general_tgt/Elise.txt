Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF: The document analyzes a malicious PowerPoint file that was distributed via spear-phishing to target individuals in Taiwan. The PowerPoint file exploits the Sandworm vulnerability CVE-2014-4114 to drop malware onto the system. This malware, dubbed ELISE by the researchers, establishes persistence and connects to command and control servers to enable further exploitation. Analysis of the malware shows it is likely associated with a threat actor group called Lotus Blossom that has been actively targeting Taiwan for espionage objectives. ELISE shares code similarities with other Lotus Blossom malware. It runs commands to gather system info, upload/download files, and open a remote shell. To evade detection, the malware creates an obese 500MB file with junk padding that likely triggers antivirus engines. The malware campaign shows Lotus Blossom is still actively targeting Taiwan using spear-phishing documents exploiting known vulnerabilities to gain a foothold on systems. Recommendations include enabling the provided Yara rules and network detection signatures to identify ELISE malware and C2 traffic. The document provides an in-depth look into the technical tactics, techniques, and procedures used in this targeted attack campaign against Taiwan.
