The document describes a new variant of the Disttrack malware that was uploaded to VirusTotal in December 2018. This malware shares code with versions used in previous Shamoon attacks against organizations in the Middle East. The malware contains a dropper component that installs a communications module and a wiper module onto infected systems. The dropper spreads across the local network using stolen credentials. This sample does not have functioning credentials, so it could only infect the system it was executed on. The wiper module overwrites the MBR, partitions, and files with randomized data to render the system inoperable. It utilizes a legitimate disk driver called RawDisk to wipe the data. The communications module connects to command and control servers to download additional malware or set a wipe date. However, this sample does not have active C2 domains configured. The malware has a hardcoded wipe date of December 7, 2017. If the system date is past this date, it will initiate the data wiping routine. Around the time this malware sample appeared, the oil company Saipem disclosed they were attacked by Shamoon malware. While the impacted company is unconfirmed, the timing suggests potential links between this new Disttrack variant and the attack on Saipem. The malware utilizes some of the same tactics as past Shamoon versions, but lacks spreading and C2 capabilities in this sample. It represents an evolution of the data-wiping tool first seen in 2012.
