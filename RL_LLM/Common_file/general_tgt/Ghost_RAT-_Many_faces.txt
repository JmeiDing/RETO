The document analyzes different variants of the Gh0st Rat remote access trojan (RAT) and maps out the connections between different botnet campaigns that use Gh0st Rat. It examines over 1200 malware samples collected over 6 months and identifies over 30 different variants based on their network communication "magic words." The analysis found several logical links between the different Gh0st Rat campaigns: Links between variants based on shared network communication protocols and magics words. Links in command and control infrastructure, with some campaigns using the same domains or IP addresses. Links in WHOIS registration data, with some campaigns registered under the same emails or using similar info The research identified "superclusters" of interconnected campaigns sharing infrastructure and protocols. One of the largest superclusters contained campaigns using the magics words cb1st, KrisR, and Gh0st. Another supercluster contained smaller campaigns like IM007, BeiJi, and Wangz. Through attribution research, some campaigns were tied to individuals involved in various cybercrime activities within China. Smaller, targeted campaigns were more difficult to attribute but had been observed targeting Tibetan groups and government organizations. Overall, the analysis demonstrates that examining malware network traffic can reveal connections between campaigns and provide insights into the relationships between threat actors using the same malware codebase.
