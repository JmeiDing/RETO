The report from Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) provides an analysis of the ShadowPad malware, which has been used by multiple Chinese state-sponsored threat groups since 2017. ShadowPad is a modular remote access trojan (RAT) deployed in software supply chain compromises by the group BRONZE ATLAS, linked to Chinese company Chengdu 404 and an individual known as Rose. ShadowPad is typically deployed in a two-file execution chain, with the malware payload embedded encrypted in a DLL loader that is sideloaded by a vulnerable legitimate executable. The loader decrypts ShadowPad in memory using a custom algorithm. Analysis revealed versions with distinct decryption schemes. ShadowPad gathers system information, executes commands, interacts with the filesystem and registry, and can deploy modules. The malware contains configuration detailing its C2 and actions like process injection for persistence. Since 2019, CTU identified new clusters of ShadowPad activity attributed to Ministry of State Security-affiliated groups BRONZE ATLAS and BRONZE UNIVERSITY. Other clusters aligned geographically with People's Liberation Army theater commands, suggesting use by PLA-linked groups. Infrastructure and malware overlap indicates possible collaboration between groups operating in the same theater command. To mitigate exposure, CTU recommends reviewing access to provided indicators like C2 domains and hashes. Continued vigilance is advised for all organizations that may be targeted by Chinese threat groups since multiple groups now leverage ShadowPad.
