The report analyzes an ongoing cyberespionage campaign called Operation Ghost conducted by a threat actor group known as the Dukes. The Dukes are also referred to as APT29 and Cozy Bear and have been active since 2008, known for breaching the DNC in 2016. The report reveals that despite public inactivity after 2017, the Dukes never stopped their espionage campaigns. Operation Ghost has been ongoing since 2013 and uses new custom malware families unseen before: PolyglotDuke, RegDuke, and FatDuke. The operation continues to target foreign affairs ministries of European governments, a pattern consistent with the Dukes' previous targeting. The new malware uses stealthy communications like Twitter and steganography for command and control. The report provides technical analysis of the stages of infection, C2 protocols, and capabilities of the new malware families. It also examines an old backdoor called LiteDuke used previously by the group. The report concludes the Dukes remain a highly sophisticated and persistent threat actor that continues to fly under the radar.
