The PDF describes a malware framework called Ponmocup that has infected over 15 million victims since 2009. Ponmocup is believed to be created and operated by Russian-speaking actors, likely for financial gain through means like credential theft and ad fraud. Ponmocup uses a modular framework with separate components for delivery, installation, command and control, and plug-ins that provide specific functionality. It employs several sophisticated techniques to avoid detection, including per-victim encryption keys, regular domain rotation for command and control servers, and anti-analysis checks that can deliver fake payloads. Some notable plug-ins include stealing browser history and credentials, scanning for SIP and router devices on networks, and ad fraud through injecting code into browsers. Plug-ins allow Ponmocup's operators to distribute specific capabilities to subsets of infected machines. The PDF provides extensive technical details on Ponmocup's operation, including indicators of compromise in the command and control traffic patterns, registry keys used, and signatures to detect components in memory. It outlines Ponmocup's prolonged timeline, large victim count, and advanced techniques as reasons why it is a successful and underestimated threat.
