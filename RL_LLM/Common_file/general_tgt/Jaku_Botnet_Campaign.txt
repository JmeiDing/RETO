The document analyzes an ongoing botnet campaign called JAKU investigated by Forcepoint. JAKU involves both indiscriminate targeting of thousands of victims as well as precision targeting of specific individuals related to North Korea. Technical analysis reveals a multi-stage infection process involving poisoned BitTorrent files and fake image files containing malware. The malware communicates with command and control (C&C) servers via encrypted protocols. It gathers system information and can execute commands from the attacker. The C&C servers store victim data in SQLite databases. Analysis of the data shows victims are predominantly in South Korea, Japan, and China. Many appear to be running counterfeit Windows installs and pirated software. The malware uses resilient, custom communication channels including DNS, TCP, UDP, and UDT protocols. It employs evasion techniques like process injection and deletion to avoid detection. The malware continues to be actively developed. The report documents the infection process, capabilities, infrastructure, victimology, and attribution clues uncovered during the JAKU investigation. It aims to provide insights into the inner workings of botnets and modern cybercrime campaigns.
