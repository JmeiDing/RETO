The document describes activity by the cybercrime group TeamTNT targeting Kubernetes deployments, specifically those running Weave Scope for monitoring and visualization. - TeamTNT has previously targeted exposed Docker APIs to spread crypto miners. - A new campaign was observed deploying docker images containing miners and self-propagation code. - Initial infection leveraged an exposed Docker API honeypot, consistent with past behavior. - In addition, infections were seen in AKS Kubernetes clusters running Weave Scope with public exposure. - Weave Scope allows container shell access without authentication by default. - The TeamTNT docker image contains a script that scans for and compromises exposed Docker APIs. - It also leverages exposed Weave Scope to gain root access to Kubernetes nodes and deploy itself. - Once deployed, the image downloads and executes crypto miners, killing competing malware. - The campaign infrastructure suggests a German origin. - Exposed management services like Docker API and Weave Scope are high-risk and frequently targeted. - Hardening and monitoring for misconfigurations is recommended. Policy and behavior monitoring can detect related activity. The summary outlines how TeamTNT has expanded tactics to not only leverage exposed Docker APIs, but also target Kubernetes deployments running internet-facing management tools. Their malware leverages multiple vectors to gain footholds, deploy miners, and self-propagate. Proper configuration and monitoring is key to detection.
