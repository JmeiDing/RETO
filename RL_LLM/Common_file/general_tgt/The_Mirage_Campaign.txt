The Mirage Campaign is a report by Dell SecureWorks detailing an ongoing cyber espionage operation that uses a remote access trojan (RAT) called Mirage or MirageFox. The campaign has targeted high-profile companies in the energy, oil, and military sectors across the Philippines, Taiwan, Canada, Brazil, Israel, Egypt and Nigeria since April 2012. The primary attack vector is spearphishing emails containing malware that installs Mirage. The emails target mid to senior level executives and pretend to be legitimate attachments like PDFs. Once executed, Mirage copies itself to system folders, creates registry keys for persistence, and phones home to command and control servers for further instructions. It collects system information like MAC address, CPU details, usernames etc. and encodes it before sending. Researchers identified two main variants that differ in their HTTP requests and payloads encoding. Custom versions were found with hardcoded credentials for specific targeted environments. Debugging artifacts point to the malware being developed as 'MirageFox' and kept in a central repository. Sinkholing domains revealed around 100-120 infected hosts across the targeted countries, including an executive level victim at the Philippine oil company. While the attackers use dynamic DNS and hosting in the US to hide their identities, overlaps between IP addresses, domains, and emails point to an actor tracked previously in the HTran and Sin Digoo cases. The campaign shows that only a small number of infections are needed to successfully steal intellectual property and secrets from targeted companies. Recommended defenses include strong perimeter security, intrusion detection, DNS monitoring, and scanning for known indicators of Mirage.
