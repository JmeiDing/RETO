The document analyzes an advanced persistent threat (APT) group called the Elderwood Project by Symantec. The group has been actively targeting defense, human rights, IT services, and other sectors since at least 2009 using zero-day exploits and custom malware. The attackers utilize a sophisticated platform to quickly deploy new zero-day exploits for delivery via spearphishing emails or watering hole attacks. They compromise websites and inject iframes to exploit visitors. The malware installs remote access Trojans with shared code connections between campaigns. The primary targets are defense supply chain manufacturers to breach top-tier defense contractors. Secondary targets are NGOs and human rights sites focused on China/Taiwan. The attacks escalated in 2012 with three zero-days used in a month. The malware contains clever features like time-delayed communications, selective infection routines, and evasion techniques. The attackers operate an infrastructure of compromised servers and build re-usable tools for crafting exploits and payloads. Symantec has tracked the group across dozens of zero-days over years, believing the resources required point to a nation state or large criminal organization. The attacks are highly systematic and focus on long-term access for intellectual property theft. Ongoing vigilance and protection are recommended against the capable Elderwood group.
