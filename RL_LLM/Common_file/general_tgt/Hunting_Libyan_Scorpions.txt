The document describes an investigation by Cyberkov Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) into a malware campaign targeting high-profile Libyan political and influential figures. In August 2016, CSIRT received reports of Android malware spreading in Libya via the Telegram messaging app. The malware was first discovered after a high-profile Telegram account was compromised from an IP address in Spain. The attackers then used the compromised account to spread malware disguised as a voice message to the account's contacts. Analysis revealed this was part of an ongoing politically-motivated malware operation since September 2015, aimed at intelligence gathering and spying. CSIRT named the threat actor group behind it the Libyan Scorpions. The Libyan Scorpions used social engineering and phishing to spread malware targeting Android and Windows devices. The malware allowed them to track locations and monitor targets. While not highly sophisticated technically, these kinds of attacks can still be effective. The report contains further details on the tactics, techniques and procedures used by the Libyan Scorpions. It also includes indicators of compromise to help the security community mitigate this threat. CSIRT notes that using malware to spy on and track individuals in an unstable warzone like Libya puts them at grave risk of assassination or kidnapping.
