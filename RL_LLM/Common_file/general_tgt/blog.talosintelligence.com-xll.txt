The PDF discusses the emergence of malicious Excel add-ins (XLL files) as an attack vector, as Microsoft starts blocking Excel macros in downloaded documents. It provides background on XLLs, which are essentially DLLs that can add functionality to Excel. Malicious actors are creating XLLs with exports like xlAutoOpen that execute code when opened in Excel. The FIN7 XLL downloaders are created with the Excel-DNA .NET framework and have been used by various threat groups, These XLL files are modified Excel-DNA shim libraries that connect to an attacker-controlled host to download additional components. The PDF tracks the evolution of malicious XLLs, which first appeared in mid-2017 from APT groups but have increased significantly recently as commodity malware adopts them. It profiles notable campaigns from threat actors like APT10, TA410, Donot, and FIN7. Dridex and FormBook campaigns drove an increase in XLL malware in late 2021. Recent interesting examples are highlighted like a Warzone RAT campaign targeting Hungary and a Ducktail information stealer campaign. The PDF concludes that as macro-based Office malware declines due to Microsoft's changes, threats actors will likely increase adoption of alternative Office add-ins like XLLs to execute malicious code without relying on macros.
