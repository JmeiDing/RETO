The PDF describes research done on malware droppers known as GuLoader. GuLoader is used to deliver various types of malware using cloud drives like Google Drive. The research uncovered that GuLoader evolved from an older crypter called DarkEyE, developed by an Italian threat actor. Through investigation, the researchers connected DarkEyE and an associated product called CloudEyE to the same Italian threat actor. CloudEyE is advertised as a legitimate software protection tool, but contains features to encrypt payloads, bypass AV checks on cloud drives, and generate randomized code. Testing confirmed CloudEyE generates droppers identical to GuLoader samples found in the wild. The company behind CloudEyE has thousands of customers and likely earns a substantial monthly revenue stream, despite enabling significant malicious activity. In summary, the research traced the major malware dropper GuLoader back to a service developed by an established Italian threat actor. This threat actor now provides an encrypted dropper builder advertised as software protection, but widely used to distribute malware undetected via cloud drives.
