The Japan Computer Emergency Response Team (JPCERT/CC) analyzed a malware loader called HUI Loader that has been used since around 2015 by multiple threat actor groups including APT10, Blue Termite, A41APT, and DEV-0401. HUI Loader is used to load and decode encrypted malware payloads like PlugX, PoisonIvy, and Quasar. It has evolved over time to add persistence mechanisms, randomize passwords, disable security features like ETW and AMSI, and remove distinctive strings. Early versions used fixed passwords to decrypt payloads while newer versions randomize them. For persistence, HUI Loader uses techniques like services, Run registry keys, and startup folders. It bypass Windows protections by disabling ETW trace logging and AMSI scanning interfaces. While HUI Loader itself has minimal functionality, it hides the malware payload and makes analysis harder. Its continued use over years by multiple threat actors makes it an effective first-stage malware. JPCERT/CC has released IOCs on GitHub and expects HUI Loader to remain an ongoing threat given its consistent use and evolution. The analysis provides insight into its loading methods and evasion techniques.
