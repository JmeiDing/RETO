The cybersecurity company Symantec has uncovered a hacking campaign by a state-sponsored group called Billbug that targeted multiple government agencies and a certificate authority in several Asian countries. Billbug is believed to have been active since at least 2009 and focuses on targets in Asia. In 2019 and 2020, Symantec tracked this group's activity under the name Thrip, but after further investigation, it was determined that Thrip and Billbug were likely the same group. The attackers gained initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications. They then used publicly available dual-use tools like AdFind, WinRAR, and Certutil along with custom malware like the Hannotog and Sagerunex backdoors to compromise victim networks. The backdoors gave the hackers remote access, command execution, and data exfiltration capabilities. While no data theft was observed, espionage is believed to be the motivation given Billbug's history and the nature of the victims. The certificate authority was likely hacked to gain the ability to sign malware with valid certificates to avoid detection. However, there is no evidence this was achieved. Billbug's reuse of known tools and targeting of multiple victims simultaneously demonstrates this is a sophisticated, persistent threat actor that remains undeterred. The campaign has been ongoing since at least March 2022. Protection methods and indicators of compromise are provided. Overall, the report exposes an active espionage operation by a capable state-sponsored group in Asia.
