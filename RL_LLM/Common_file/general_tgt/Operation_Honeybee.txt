The document describes an operation called Operation Honeybee that was discovered by McAfee researchers. The operation involved a malicious document campaign targeting humanitarian aid groups. The malicious documents contained North Korean political themes as lures to get victims to open the documents. Once opened, the documents installed a malware backdoor called SYSCON on the victim's computer. Researchers found that the campaign heavily targeted victims in Vietnam in mid-January 2018. Analysis showed the documents were authored by a Korean speaker. The malware used unique encoding keys that matched previous SYSCON campaigns dating back to August 2017. The malware established persistence on systems and exfiltrated data like system info and running processes back to a command server. The malware variants used new droppers not seen before, indicating the threat actors created new tools specific for this campaign. The malware bypassed Windows UAC protections in its installation process. In addition to Vietnam, researchers saw targeting in South Korea, Singapore, Argentina, Japan, Indonesia, and Canada. The campaign specifically went after those involved in humanitarian aid and North/South Korean affairs. The report provides IOCs like file hashes, domain names, and MITRE ATT&CK techniques used by the malware. It concludes that this was a unique operation using custom malware to target a specific set of victims related to Korea issues and aid groups.
