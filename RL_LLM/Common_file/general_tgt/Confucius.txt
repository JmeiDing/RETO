The PDF discusses two malware families called CONFUCIUS_A and CONFUCIUS_B that use legitimate websites like Yahoo and Quora to obtain command and control servers rather than using DNS lookups, which helps them evade detection. CONFUCIUS_A has links to attacks associated with a backdoor called SNEEPY that targeted Pakistan starting in 2013. It is delivered via phishing emails with attachments pretending to be invites, porn, software updates, news, etc. CONFUCIUS_A pieces together IP addresses for command and control servers by decoding keywords hidden in the content of Quora and Yahoo pages. CONFUCIUS_B is similar but uses a different obfuscation method. It has loose links to the Operation Patchwork and Hangover attacks. Like CONFUCIUS_A, it uses keywords from Quora and Yahoo pages to derive IP addresses for command and control. There is evidence CONFUCIUS_B may have originated from the same developer(s) as CONFUCIUS_A. While the two malware families use different infrastructure, their novel technique of abusing legitimate sites to hide command and control communication suggests a common origin. The targets appear to be primarily in the Middle East and Asia. The PDF provides indiciator of compromise information like malware hashes, domains, IP addresses, and resolver URLs associated with the two malware families.
