The document describes new research from ESET on campaigns by the cyberespionage group Turla. Turla has long used fake Adobe Flash Player installers to distribute malware to targets. Recently, Turla has started bundling real Flash installers along with their malware installers. The fake installers use IP addresses and URLs that appear linked to legitimate Adobe infrastructure. This tricks users into thinking they are only downloading authentic Adobe software. The campaigns distributing these installers have been targeting embassies and consulates in former Soviet states since at least July 2016. The installers drop various Turla backdoors including Mosquito, a JavaScript backdoor, and an unknown backdoor. Mosquito backdoor samples were heavily obfuscated, tampered with the registry for persistence, and logged actions on compromised machines. The JavaScript backdoor communicated with a Google Apps Script web app. Researchers propose several methods Turla could be using to intercept victim traffic and serve the fake installers, including compromising the local network, ISPs, or using BGP hijacking. However, no compromise of Adobe itself was detected. Once installed, the backdoors exfiltrate data like system IDs, usernames, and security products. Finally, the fake installer drops a real Flash installer or downloader, running legitimate Flash in the end. The continued evolution of Turla's social engineering and distribution tactics highlights the group's persistence in compromising high-value diplomatic and government targets across Eastern Europe.
