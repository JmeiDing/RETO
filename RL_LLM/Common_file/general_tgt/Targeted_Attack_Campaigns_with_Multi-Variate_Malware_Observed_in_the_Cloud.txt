The PDF discusses targeted cyberattack campaigns that Netskope Threat Research Labs observed in enterprise cloud environments. The attacks involved sending emails with zipped JavaScript attachments that would sync and share themselves via cloud storage apps. File names resembled recipients' email addresses to appear more legitimate when shared. The JavaScript attachments contained varying obfuscation techniques but ultimately dropped a remote access trojan, keylogger, or ransomware payload on the victim's system. Payloads included Adwind RAT, iSpy keylogger, and Locky ransomware variants. The automated file sharing spread the infection rapidly in the cloud. Netskope detected the attacks at multiple stages, including the initial zipped JavaScript attachment, obfuscated code, and final payload. The JavaScript exploited Windows Script Host to download the malicious payload and used domain generation algorithms to avoid blocking. Payloads employed anti-virus evasion and remote scanning resistance. To counter such threats, Netskope recommends detecting and remediating malware in sanctioned cloud apps, blocking unsanctioned cloud access, using remote file scanning, backing up critical data, avoiding suspicious attachments, tracking risky cloud usage, updating systems/AV, and enforcing data policies. The layered defense highlights the importance of cloud-based security to cover the entire attack chain.
