The PDF describes a series of ongoing malware attacks targeting Colombian government institutions and private companies, called Operation Spalax. The attackers use phishing emails containing malicious links or attachments to distribute remote access trojans (RATs) to victims. The RATs allow them to spy on targets by logging keystrokes, taking screenshots, accessing webcams/microphones, and exfiltrating documents. Three different RATs have been observed: Remcos, njRAT, and AsyncRAT. They are distributed via droppers packed with various obfuscation techniques to avoid detection. The droppers decrypt and execute the RAT payloads. The attackers have a large, dynamic infrastructure to hide their activities, including 24+ IP addresses and 70+ domain names registered with free dynamic DNS services since mid-2020. Most IPs are residential addresses in Colombia, likely compromised machines proxying traffic. The attacks are still active and expected to continue targeting Colombian entities. The attackers tailor phishing emails to targets using native Spanish and Colombian themes. While their motives appear to be cyber espionage, some targets like lotteries suggest possible cybercrime links too. In summary, the PDF provides an overview of the ongoing, targeted RAT attacks against Colombian entities using phishing and obfuscated droppers to distribute spyware, supported by a large, hidden network infrastructure. The threat actors are persistent and expected to continue intrusion attempts in the region.
