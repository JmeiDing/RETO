ESET researchers discovered a previously unknown cyberespionage platform called Attor that has been active since at least 2013. It uses curious GSM fingerprinting and Tor-based communications. Attor is used in highly targeted attacks against diplomatic, governmental, and privacy-concerned users, primarily in Russia and Eastern Europe. It has a complex architecture with a dispatcher and loadable modules. The espionage modules collect sensitive data like documents, audio, screenshots, and keystrokes. Data is exfiltrated over Tor using FTP to a C2 server. One module fingerprints GSM/mobile devices using AT commands to gather info like IMEI, phone model, SIM details. The purpose is unclear but concerning. Attor incorporates several evasion techniques like process injection, timestomping, virtualization checks, and multilayer encryption. Updates can be pushed from the C2. The platform can be executed through API, modules, rundll32, scheduled tasks, and as a service. It also has obfuscation techniques for files and information, file deletion after exfiltration, hidden files and directories, registry modifications, process injection, and disguises itself as a legitimate task.
