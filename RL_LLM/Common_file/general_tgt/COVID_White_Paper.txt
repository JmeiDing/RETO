The white paper provides an overview of how various advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have been using the COVID-19 pandemic as a lure in cyberattacks. It categorizes the techniques used by these groups into four main types: template injection, malicious macros, RTF exploits, and malicious LNK files. Template injection refers to embedding a script in a document that fetches a remote malicious template. Groups like Kimsuky and Gamaredon have used COVID-19 themed documents with template injection to target victims. The malicious templates typically contain macros that collect system information and exfiltrate it. Embedding malicious macros directly in documents has been the most common technique. Groups like Kimsuky, Konni, APT36, Patchwork, Hades, TA505, TA542, Bitter, and Ocean Lotus have used macro-enabled COVID-19 themed documents that drop malware like remote access Trojans after being opened. The macros are usually obfuscated and decrypt malicious payloads. Some Chinese groups have used COVID-19 themed RTF files exploiting the equation editor vulnerability to drop backdoors. Calypso group and Winnti are examples of actors using this technique recently. Malicious LNK files have also been observed in campaigns by groups like Mustang Panda and Higaisia. Opening the LNK file leads to execution of the command embedded in the property section, which decodes an embedded base64 payload and drops it into the victim's machine. The dropped payload is a cabinet file that contains multiple files, and content is extracted using the legitimate Windows executable "extract.exe".The LNK files link to scripts that eventually drop remote access Trojans. In summary, the white paper provides an overview of how various sophisticated threat actors have quickly adopted COVID-19 themes and current events in their social engineering tactics and cyberattacks. Their techniques involve using the pandemic crisis as a lure in phishing emails and weaponized documents that infect systems with malware like remote access Trojans upon opening.
