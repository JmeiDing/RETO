Secureworks investigated a ransomware incident in June 2022 that was attributed to the Iranian threat group COBALT MIRAGE. The threat actors exploited ProxyShell vulnerabilities to gain access and deployed their customary web shells and TunnelFish malware. In examining the artifacts left behind, researchers discovered a ransom note PDF file created by an individual named Ahmad Khatibi. Metadata showed it was made in Iran, and further investigation revealed Khatibi is CEO of Iranian company Afkar System. Leaked information indicates Afkar System works on behalf of Iranian intelligence. Additional infrastructure analysis connected other Iranian companies Najee Technology and Secnerd to COBALT MIRAGE operations. Their CEO Mansour Ahmadi was linked to COBALT MIRAGE domains and malware. reports describe Najee Technology and Afkar System supporting the group's activity. This shows COBALT MIRAGE works with Iranian companies who may act as fronts or provide infrastructure support. Some attacks appear politically motivated, while other ransomware campaigns seem focused on revenue generation. The connections between contractors and Iranian intelligence are blurred. To mitigate exposure, Secureworks recommends restricting access to the provided indicators of compromise which include domains, IPs, hashes associated with this activity. Continued patching against exploits like ProxyShell is also advised.
