The document provides an in-depth analysis of the WastedLocker ransomware attacks targeting major US corporations. WastedLocker is attributed to the Evil Corp cybercrime group. The initial infection involves a JavaScript-based framework called SocGholish that pretends to be a software update. It profiles the system and downloads additional discovery scripts. Next, Cobalt Strike malware is deployed to escalate privileges, dump credentials, spread across the network, and disable security software. The Windows Sysinternals PsExec tool is used to disable Windows Defender and stop services. Finally, WastedLocker is launched to encrypt files and demand ransom. Symantec discovered 31 targeted organizations, mostly large corporations and Fortune 500 companies across manufacturing, IT, media and other sectors. The attacks are professionally executed, allowing the attackers to penetrate sophisticated networks and move with ease to prepare for ransomware deployment. The report provides technical details on WastedLocker's capabilities and step-by-step stages of the attack sequence. Indicators of compromise are included such as file hashes, domains, IPs, and YARA rules. Protection details outline how Symantec products detect and block the threat. The attacks represent a serious threat to corporations that could result in significant damages if not prevented. In summary, the document provides an extensive analysis of the sophisticated, multistage WastedLocker ransomware attack campaign impacting major US corporations and Symantec's efforts to detect, block, and notify targets to defend against the threat.
