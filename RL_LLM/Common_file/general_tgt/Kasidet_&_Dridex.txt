Zscaler ThreatLabZ analyzed a malicious Office document campaign delivering both Dridex banking trojan and Kasidet backdoor. The macro inside the Office document downloads the malware payload from URLs hosted on compromised sites. Kasidet installs itself in the appdata folder and uses anti-VM checks to avoid sandboxes. It steals data via memory scraping and browser hooking, sending it to a C2 server. The browser hooking injects code into Firefox, Chrome, and IE to steal sensitive data from these browsers. Network communication uses hardcoded HTTP headers and encrypted C2 commands. Locale checks disable theft from Russian systems. Dridex is also delivered by the same macro document. The shared infrastructure shows criminals reuse delivery mechanisms. Zscaler recommends blocking the identified C2 domains and IOCs listed. The campaign shows blended threats combining banking trojan and backdoor for maximum monetization.
