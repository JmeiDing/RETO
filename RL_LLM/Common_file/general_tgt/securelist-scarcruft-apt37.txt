The PDF describes research by Kaspersky on a threat actor group called ScarCruft, also known as APT37 or Temp.Reaper. ScarCruft is a nation-state sponsored group that conducts cyberespionage and surveillance against targets related to North Korea, including journalists, defectors, and government organizations. Recently, Kaspersky assisted a news organization investigating ScarCruft activity. Analysis of a compromised host revealed a new PowerShell backdoor called CryWiper that disguises as ransomware but actually destroys data. Additional investigation uncovered Windows and Android variants with similar capabilities called Chinotto. The Windows malware uses HTTP for command and control. After an initial beacon, it can exfiltrate data, run commands, take screenshots, etc. The Android variant requests excessive permissions and can collect sensitive user info. Analysis suggests Chinotto development began around mid-2019, evolving from PowerShell scripts to standalone executables. Links were also found to older malware like POORWEB, based on code reuse. Infrastructure analysis uncovered 75 infections in South Korea and a control panel for monitoring victims. Spearphishing documents suggest targeting since at least mid-2020. Victimology fits ScarCruft's interest in North Korea-related entities. The report concludes that ScarCruft ran a long-term surveillance campaign against individuals using evolving malware. The findings will help protect targeted groups like journalists and defectors. Indicators of compromise are provided to aid detection.
