The PDF analyzes a new banking trojan called Lampion that was used in a spear phishing campaign targeting Portugal. It uses multiple techniques to evade detection: - Obfuscated VBS downloader fetches encrypted next stage payloads. - Payloads protected by VMProtect packer to avoid analysis. - Loads malicious DLLs directly into memory only. - Dependency on additional encrypted DLL prevents dynamic analysis. Infection starts with emails about fake tax documents. These contain links to download a zip file with the VBS downloader. The VBS achieves persistence and fetches two more payloads - the Lampion trojan and an encrypted DLL. Lampion exfiltrates system info and credentials to a C2 server. The malware is not widely detected yet. Attribution clues include Portuguese language messages and registrar info pointing to Chinese origins. Recommendations include blocking unneeded Office macros, monitoring unusual outbound connections, and user education on phishing techniques.
