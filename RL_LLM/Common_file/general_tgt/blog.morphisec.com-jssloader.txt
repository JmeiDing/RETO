The post details a new wave of infections utilizing a trojan called JSSLoader, which has been tracked since late 2020. JSSLoader is a .NET remote access trojan (RAT) used by the FIN7 hacking group that has capabilities like data exfiltration, persistence, updating, and more. This new JSSLoader variant is being delivered through weaponized Excel .XLL add-in files in phishing emails. When executed, the XLL file downloads the obfuscated JSSLoader payload from a remote server and executes it. The xlAutoOpen function in the XLL is responsible for the malicious activity. While functionality is the same, this JSSLoader version introduces a new obfuscation layer to evade detection by splitting strings into substrings and concatenating them at runtime. This aims to break string-based YARA rules used to detect JSSLoader. The post notes that most next-gen antivirus and endpoint detection/response solutions will fail to detect these day zero XLL-JSSLoader attacks, leaving networks exposed. However, Morphisec's Moving Target Defense technology can instantly stop these and other unknown attacks by hiding critical system assets. In summary, the post analyzes the infection chain and obfuscation techniques in a new JSSLoader variant being spread through weaponized XLL Excel add-ins to highlight detection issues faced by traditional security tools.
