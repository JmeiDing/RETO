The document analyzes watering hole attacks conducted by a cyberespionage group called StrongPity. The group set up fake sites mimicking the distribution sites for popular encryption software WinRAR and TrueCrypt. Links on legitimate distributor sites redirected users to the fake sites with trojanized installers. StrongPity targeted primarily Italian and Belgian encryption users starting in May 2016. The malware installed from the fake sites provided backdoor access and stole disk contents and communications. Configuration data showed a focus on stealing data from SSH, SFTP, and RDP applications. In total, StrongPity compromised over 1000 systems across Europe and North Africa. Their innovative tactics and interest in encryption software users showcase an advanced threat actor willing to take risks to steal sensitive data. The report aims to expose their methods to help potential targets defend against such watering hole attacks and supply chain compromises.
