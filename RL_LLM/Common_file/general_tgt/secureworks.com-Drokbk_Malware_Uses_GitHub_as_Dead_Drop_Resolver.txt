The Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) researchers have been investigating the Drokbk malware used by the Iranian government-sponsored threat group COBALT MIRAGE. Drokbk is comprised of a dropper and payload written in .NET. It was first observed in February 2022 being used in an intrusion of a US local government network. Drokbk is deployed post-intrusion for additional persistence. It uses a technique called dead drop resolving to determine its command and control (C2) server by connecting to GitHub. The C2 information is stored in a README file that the malware checks. Between June-July 2022, the threat actors changed the C2 server multiple times. The dropper installs the payload as a service called SessionService.exe in the SoftwareDistribution folder. The payload sends an initial beacon to the C2 server containing the infected host's hostname and current time. During analysis, Drokbk created temporary files but did not receive any additional payloads or commands. To mitigate exposure, CTU recommends reviewing access using the provided indicators which include hashes, domain names, IPs, and URLs associated with Drokbk and the COBALT MIRAGE group. The IP addresses can be reallocated so may contain new malicious content if accessed.
