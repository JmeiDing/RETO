The Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence team discovered a new remote access trojan (RAT) named Woody Rat that has been active for at least a year. This advanced, custom RAT is used by a threat actor mainly targeting Russian entities through spear phishing emails containing archive files or Office documents exploiting the Follina vulnerability. Based on a fake domain registered by the threat actor, the target appears to be a Russian aerospace and defense entity known as OAK. The earliest versions of Woody Rat were distributed through zip archive files pretending to be specific Russian documents. More recently, the threat actor has switched to using the Follina Office vulnerability to distribute the payload. The malware uses a machine-specific cookie derived from system info to communicate with the command and control server (C2) along with a combination of RSA-4096 and AES-CBC encryption. The malware supports a wide variety of commands classified into _SET and _REQ requests, which are executed by a separate thread from the one used to communicate with the C2. After creating the command threads, the malware deletes itself from disk using ProcessHollowing technique and sets the entry point of the thread to resume deletion. Woody Rat has a diverse set of capabilities enabled through C2 commands. It can execute processes and scripts, upload/download files, take screenshots, list directories, inject code into processes, and more. Two embedded .NET DLLs (WoodySharpExecutor and WoodyPowerSession) allow it to execute .NET code and PowerShell commands/scripts received from the C2. After creating its threads, Woody Rat uses process hollowing to delete itself from disk. The threat actor behind Woody Rat is currently unknown. While Chinese and North Korean groups have targeted Russia in the past, there are no definitive attribution indicators. Malwarebytes proactively blocks the Follina exploit used recently and detects Woody Rat via heuristic engines.
