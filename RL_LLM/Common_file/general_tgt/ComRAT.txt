The report by ESET analyzes the evolution of a sophisticated malware family called ComRAT, used by the cyberespionage group Turla (also known as Snake). Turla has been active for over 10 years targeting high-profile organizations like governments and militaries in Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East. ComRAT originated as the malware Agent.BTZ which was involved in a 2008 breach of the US military. It has gone through several iterations over the years, with version 4 released around 2017 being a complete code rewrite. ComRAT v4 uses complex features like a virtual FAT16 file system to store its configuration and modules. It has two command and control channels - one using HTTP like older versions, and one newly added that utilizes the Gmail web interface to send commands and exfiltrate data. ESET has identified at least 3 targets of ComRAT v4 - two foreign ministries and one national parliament. It is used to gather sensitive documents which are compressed and exfiltrated via public cloud storage services. ComRAT v4 is attributed to Turla based on victimology, shared code, and infrastructure links to other Turla tools. It is still in use as of early 2020, showing the group's continued development. The report concludes that Turla remains a highly capable threat actor through long-term use and constant evolution of advanced malware like ComRAT.
