The document analyzes a new variant of destructive "wiper" malware that has received media attention. Cisco's Talos team has seen this type of malware since the 1990s. The malware overwrites systems to render data inaccessible, similar to ransomware. It can also cover up other malicious activity. Proper backups and defense strategies help protect against it. Analysis of sample files shows the malware contains IP addresses of command and control servers. The files had to be modified to capture network traffic for analysis. The malware sends beacons to C2 servers containing the infected host's IP address and hostname. But the code allocates too large a buffer, resulting in extra data. This provides a detection signature. Further debugging and analysis of the assembly code confirms how the beacon payload is constructed and sent. The extra data comes from the stack. Based on the analysis, Talos developed more robust detection rules that identify all hardcoded parts of the payload across Windows versions. The post concludes quality detection requires full threat understanding. This enables better customer protection as malware evolves. Cisco security products help prevent, detect, and block such threats.
