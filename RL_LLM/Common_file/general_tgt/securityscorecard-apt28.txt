CredoMap is a malware stealer developed by the Russia-based threat actor APT28/Fancy Bear and used to target victims in Ukraine. CredoMap was spread via a document exploiting the Follina vulnerability to download the .NET stealer. The analysis found that CredoMap’s process first obtains the path of the current executable file and then connects to port 143 (IMAP) on the hard-coded C2 server (162.241.216.236). It logs in using hardcoded credentials and reads the server's response. The malware uses IMAP email protocols to exfiltrate stolen data to a command and control server. The malicious binary creates a TcpClient object, gets read and write client streams, and then reads the response from the server. It selects the INBOX folder and performs multiple function calls to steal the browser’s credentials and cookies. It decrypts credentials stored in the browsers using AES-GCM and DPAPI. Extracted credentials and cookies are serialized to JSON and sent to the C2 via IMAP APPEND commands masquerading as emails. Next, the malicious binary opens a connection to the Cookies database and executes a SQL query to extract some fields. It also opens and reads a file named "Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/Local State", extracts a Base64-encoded random key from it, and decrypts it using DPAPI. Finally, CredoMap stores the extracted information in a dictionary and exports it to IMAP via JSON serialization. Newly created files will be deleted using the File.Delete method. Indicators of compromise include the C2 IP, spawned cmd processes, and code strings found via reverse engineering. A YARA rule can detect the malware. The use of Follina, stealthy IMAP C2, and encryption shows sophisticated tradecraft by APT28 to stealthily steal and exfiltrate sensitive browser data from targets.
