The document describes the technical details of zero-day exploits used in a cyberattack campaign called Operation WizardOpium discovered in October 2019. The exploits targeted vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and the Windows kernel component win32k. The Chrome exploit abused a use-after-free vulnerability in the WebAudio component, assigned CVE-2019-13720. It involved intricate JavaScript code to trigger the bug, build arbitrary read/write primitives, and use WASM for executing shellcode. The shellcode exploited an elevation of privilege vulnerability in win32k (CVE-2019-1458) to escape the Chrome sandbox. The win32k exploit allowed overwriting pointer values during window creation to achieve arbitrary pointer dereference. It parsed kernel structures to find token handles and steal the system token for privilege escalation. It supported Windows 7, 10 v10240, and v14393 by using different techniques like GDI handle table parsing. The exploits delivered a malware payload. The report analyzes the technical aspects of the vulnerabilities, memory corruption, RCE chains, privilege escalation, payload delivery, and impacted versions. It notes that Chrome's Win32k lockdown mitigation prevented exploitation on the latest Windows 10. The attack targeted older Windows 7 systems. In summary, the document provides an in-depth analysis of the zero-day exploits used in Operation WizardOpium - from triggering the Chrome and win32k bugs, building primitives, and payload execution, to the targeted systems and vulnerability impact. It reveals details of the exploit development, inner workings, and delivery mechanism.
