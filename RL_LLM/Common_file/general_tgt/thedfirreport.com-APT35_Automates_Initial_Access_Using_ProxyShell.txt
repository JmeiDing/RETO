The PDF analyzes an intrusion campaign observed in December 2021 exploiting the Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell vulnerabilities to gain initial access. The threat actors' tactics, techniques, and procedures aligned with the suspected Iranian state-sponsored group APT35. After exploiting ProxyShell, the attackers uploaded web shells and disabled antivirus. They established persistence via scheduled tasks and account creation, adding the new account to admin groups. The attackers enumerated the environment and disabled security features like LSA protection. The attackers dumped LSASS process memory to obtain credentials, zipped the dump, and exfiltrated it. They also downloaded and executed a suspicious golang binary exhibiting similarities to a modified Fast Reverse Proxy tool. This connected to domains likely for C2. The activity occurred in two short bursts within 3 days, suggesting the use of automation scripts given the rapid repeat of steps. The user agents linked to Python requests libraries, further indicating scripting. In total, the intrusion followed the typical attack lifecycle - initial access via Exchange exploit, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, and C2 communication. The report concludes APT35 is automating the early attack stages for efficiency in compromising targets of interest.
