Here is a summary of the Duqu Trojan Questions and Answers PDF: The PDF provides an overview and analysis of the Duqu trojan malware threat discovered in 2011. Duqu is composed of a Windows kernel driver that loads encrypted DLLs implementing a remote access trojan (RAT) payload. An additional information stealing module logs keystrokes and system data. While there are some similarities between Duqu's kernel driver injection techniques and those used in Stuxnet, analysis shows the ultimate payloads are very different. The evidence is insufficient to definitively prove Duqu and Stuxnet come from the same source. Duqu does not target industrial control systems like Stuxnet. Duqu's main purpose is to provide an attacker with remote access and the ability to run arbitrary code on a victim system. No specific targets are evident in the code. Indicators of infection include network connections to Duqu command and control servers, DNS lookups for Duqu domains, presence of files named "~DQ", and non-SSL traffic over port 443. Protection measures include monitoring network connections and egress traffic, detecting Duqu-related files, and using antivirus, antimalware and host-based security controls. However, Duqu variants can bypass antivirus detection. holistic security encompassing network controls and monitoring, segmentation, access controls and policies is recommended. In summary, Duqu is a remote access trojan exhibiting some technical similarities to Stuxnet but lacking specifics linking it to ICS attacks. It provides flexible malware capabilities allowing an attacker to control compromised systems. Ongoing monitoring, network security controls, and host protections can help mitigate the threat.
