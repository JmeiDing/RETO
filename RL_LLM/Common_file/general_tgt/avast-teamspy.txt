TeamSpy is malware that abuses the remote access tool TeamViewer to take control of infected computers. It spreads via malicious Excel attachments that have macros to silently install TeamViewer and the malware component. The malware hooks APIs to hide TeamViewer windows and activity from the user. It sends system info and TeamViewer ID to a C&C server for the attackers to connect remotely. Commands are sent to the malware via the TeamViewer chat to perform actions on the infected system. Using TeamViewer for C&C communication encrypts traffic and makes it hard to distinguish from legitimate use.
