The blog post is a technical analysis by Cyble Research Labs of a new Android malware named capraRAT. This malware is used by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group called APT36, also known as Transparent Tribe, which targets the Indian government and military. When installed, capraRAT hides its app icon and continuously communicates with a command and control server. It can steal sensitive data like contacts, SMS messages, call logs, location, take screenshots, record audio, and more. It can also send SMS messages, make calls, update itself, and delete files based on commands from the control server. The malware requests extensive permissions like reading SMS, contacts, call logs, location data, recording audio, accessing cameras, etc. Technical analysis of the code shows how it implements these capabilities. The malware communicates with a control server at android.viral91[.]xyz, which has been associated with other malware from APT36. The post provides indicators of compromise like the SHA256 hash of the malware sample analyzed and the control server URL. It also gives recommendations on how to prevent, identify, and respond to such malware infections for both individuals and organizations. Overall, the post provides an in-depth look at the capabilities and operation of a sophisticated new Android spyware used by a threat actor group targeting the Indian government and military.
