The PDF analyzes a cyberespionage campaign called Operation Double Tap conducted by a Chinese threat actor group known as APT3 or UPS. The group sent spearphishing emails containing exploits for two vulnerabilities - CVE-2014-6332 and CVE-2014-4113. The exploits delivered a multi-stage malware payload which established a connection to command and control servers. Researchers uncovered links between the infrastructure and previous APT3 campaigns, attributing the activity to this group. Notably, APT3 has historically relied on zero-day exploits for infrequent but widespread attacks. Their use here of known exploits and more frequent attacks may indicate a shift in strategy. The targeting and tolls align with APT3's previous cyberespionage campaigns aimed at stealing data. By revealing their latest tactics, techniques, and procedures, the analysis aims to help organizations improve defenses against this advanced threat actor. The report concludes that APT3 appears to have increased attacks and no longer relies solely on rare zero-days, but remains a sophisticated and active threat.
