The PDF analyzes a malware campaign that targeted the Russian real estate company PIK Group. The malware combined ransomware, a trojan, and a cryptocurrency miner. The initial infection vector was a JavaScript file posing as a PIK Group order confirmation. The JavaScript was heavily obfuscated but eventually loaded a fake image file that contained malware. The malware installed the Troldesh ransomware to encrypt files, the Nheqminer cryptocurrency miner, and a trojan that brute forced WordPress sites to install a backdoor. The ransomware encrypted files and displayed a ransom note demanding payment. The miner mined Monero cryptocurrency for the attackers. The trojan brute forced WordPress sites and installed a backdoor to compromise them. The PDF provides IOCs including file hashes, C2 servers, malware download URLs, and a list of 200+ compromised WordPress sites from the trojan's brute forcing. The unusual combination of ransomware, miner, and trojan point to an attacker focused on different methods of monetization rather than espionage. The attacks did not appear targeted specifically at PIK Group.
