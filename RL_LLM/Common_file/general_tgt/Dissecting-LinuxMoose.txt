Here is a summary of the key points from the Linux/Moose malware analysis PDF: Linux/Moose is a router-based malware that spreads by compromising Linux-based routers and embedded devices using default or weak credentials. Once infected, the device's resources are used to steal network traffic and offer proxy services to the malware operators. The operators leverage the infected devices to perform fraudulent actions like fake follows, views, and likes on social media sites. The malware has extensive capabilities to spread across networks and evade detection. It scans for nearby IP addresses and pivots through routers to penetrate private networks. It can traverse NAT firewalls using a custom tunneling protocol. The malware listens on port 10073 but only allows a specific whitelist of IPs to connect as a proxy service. It can also hijack DNS settings during infection to enable man-in-the-middle attacks. A major goal is to steal HTTP cookies from social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. The operators then abuse the proxy service on port 10073 to access these sites. Traffic analysis reveals the proxies are predominantly used to access Twitter, Instagram, and SoundCloud. Hundreds of fraudulent social media accounts have been spotted as a result. Linux/Moose periodically kills off competing malware processes to monopolize the resources of the infected system. It has no persistence mechanism itself, relying on credentials and IP address knowledge to reinfect devices. The malware communicates with multiple hardcoded command and control servers to obtain configurations. ESET researchers monitored an active infection to gain insights into the operation. They provide configuration details, network protocol analysis, and indicators of compromise to help defenders detect infections and inhibit the malware's operation. A list of potentially affected router vendors is included, though many devices could be impacted given Linux/Moose's spreading methods.
