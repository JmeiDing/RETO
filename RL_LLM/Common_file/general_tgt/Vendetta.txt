The document analyzes a new threat actor named Vendetta that has been active since April 2020. Vendetta appears to originate from Europe based on language clues in their malware code. Vendetta conducts cyber espionage campaigns that rely heavily on social engineering, forging phishing emails posing as government agencies and companies to get users to open malware. Email topics include police investigations, COVID-19 alerts, and corporate communications. Vendetta's malware uses code obfuscators like RoboSki to hide malicious payloads and execution logic in image files.
