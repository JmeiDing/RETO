ChChes is a malware that communicates with C&C servers using HTTP. It can execute multiple functions, including uploading files, downloading files, loading DLLs, executing shell commands, and encrypting communication. Spearphishing emails containing ZIP archives are sent to targets. ZIP archives contain executable files disguised as Word documents. Victims are tricked into executing the malware executable. ChChes makes an initial HTTP request to the C2 server sending system info. The C2 responds with an ID to identify the infected host. ChChes requests modules and commands using the ID in cookie headers. C2 sends back encrypted modules and commands. Modules extending functionality are loaded into memory. An early module enables AES encrypted C2 communications. ChChes executes commands received from the C2. Additional data like command outputs are exfiltrated to the C2. Process repeats to receive more modules and commands.
