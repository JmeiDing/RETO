The document analyzes two malware downloaders used by a threat actor group called CNC to target the military and education sectors. The first downloader, named PrivateImage.png.exe, either spreads itself via removable drives or downloads a second stage payload if internet access is available. It evades detection by disguising itself as an image file and hiding copied documents in folders named after the username. The second downloader, YodaoCloudMgr.exe, uses an untrusted digital certificate for command and control communication. It generates random strings to construct URLs to download additional payloads from a GitHub repository controlled by the attackers. Analysis suggests both downloaders are attributed to CNC based on code similarities with previous malware from the group. CNC has been active since at least 2019 and typically uses remote access Trojans. The updated malware shows the group's continued development. The attacks are mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, with behaviors spanning 15 techniques across 8 tactics. This demonstrates CNC's proficiency and systematic approach to penetrating isolated networks, a key goal of advanced persistent threat actors. The report concludes that APT groups are increasingly targeting and developing specialized malware to infiltrate air-gapped networks. Regular monitoring and updates are required to detect and defend against these types of threats.
