The document is a threat advisory from Fidelis Security Systems about malware called Darkseoul/Jokra that was used in cyberattacks against South Korean companies. The malware overwrites the master boot record (MBR) and volume boot record (VBR) to make systems unusable. It writes patterns like "HASTATI" and "PR!NCPES" when overwriting data. The malware gains disk access by opening the physical drive as a file. It first overwrites the VBR location, which is sector 56 on XP systems. It then continues overwriting in a loop using 512 byte patterns on XP and 1023 byte patterns on Windows 7. The malware creates threads to overwrite all fixed drives it finds. It runs commands to kill security processes from AhnLab and HAURI, then reboots the system. The wiping happens quickly, in 10-15 minutes. While the malware makes the system unusable, it does not wipe all data. Using forensic tools like EnCase, the backup VBR can be recovered to restore the file system and recover files. The MBR can also be repaired manually with a hex editor to boot the system, though some corruption will likely remain. Overall, the malware aims to corrupt and disable systems quickly by overwriting key parts of the boot process. However, a significant amount of data can be recovered by leveraging backup boot records and forensic tools. The Fidelis XPS system can detect this threat and research continues into mitigation techniques.
