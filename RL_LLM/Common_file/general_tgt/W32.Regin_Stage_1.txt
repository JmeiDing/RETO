The document analyzes the first stage malware component of Regin, a complex cyberespionage threat. Stage 1 is designed to retrieve and load an encrypted payload (stage 2) from an already compromised system and make it harder to detect. Analysis of 27 samples shows stage 1 targets Windows, supports NT 4.0 and up, and samples fall into "pure" or "augmented" categories. The malware retrieves the payload from extended file attributes or the registry if that fails. It decrypts the payload using an XOR algorithm. Stage 1 uses an unusual "trampoline" technique to hide the payload's calls to external functions. It resolves imports but redirects calls through chunks of code that mask the origin of API calls. This fools monitoring tools into thinking calls come from trusted modules. The malware maps the payload into memory like a PE loader, processes relocations, and masks certain data directories. It then transfers control to stage 2. The report concludes stage 1 is purely support code to hide additional components, but shows the developers are skilled coders with significant resources. Indicators of compromise, code examples demonstrating the trampoline technique, and other technical details are provided. The author speculates there may be a 64-bit version based on supported relocation types.
