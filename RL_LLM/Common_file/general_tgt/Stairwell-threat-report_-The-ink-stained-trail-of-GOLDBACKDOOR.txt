The report analyzes a new malware family called GOLDBACKDOOR used in spear phishing campaigns targeting journalists reporting on North Korea. The malware shares code similarities with BLUELIGHT, attributed to North Korean APT37. The infection chain starts with emails containing links to ZIP files on compromised sites impersonating media organizations. The ZIP files contain weaponized LNK shortcut files that use PowerShell scripts to deploy the malware. The PowerShell drops a decoy document and executes multiple stages of position-independent shellcode to evade detection. The shellcode uses process injection to load the final GOLDBACKDOOR payload. GOLDBACKDOOR exfiltrates data to cloud drives and has keylogging, screen capture, and remote shell capabilities. The PDB path indicates potential shared developers with BLUELIGHT. Lure documents with web beacons track if victims open attachments. The report provides indicators, YARA rules, and mitigation advice. It highlights the ongoing cyber espionage threat to journalists and dissidents from North Korean APT groups like APT37 using custom malware like GOLDBACKDOOR for stealthy data theft.
