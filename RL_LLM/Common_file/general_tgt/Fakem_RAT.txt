The report describes a family of remote access trojans (RATs) called "FAKEM" that disguise their network traffic to avoid detection. The FAKEM RAT variants were distributed via spear-phishing emails containing malicious attachments that exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word, Excel, and .exe files. Once installed, FAKEM connects to command-and-control servers and allows attackers to remotely control the compromised system. FAKEM disguises its traffic to appear as normal protocols like Windows Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, and HTML. While experts can distinguish the disguised traffic from real traffic, the disguises may allow FAKEM to avoid scrutiny in large networks. The RAT encrypts its traffic by XOR-ing each byte with a repeating key. Analysis found FAKEM variants clustered into campaigns focused on specific domains, suggesting distribution among multiple threat actors rather than one group. The capabilities provided by the C&C server include executing commands, uploading files, taking screenshots, and harvesting passwords. While popular RATs like PoisonIvy are well-known, FAKEM shows attackers are developing new tools that blend in better. The disguises may provide enough cover for attackers to persist undetected. Solutions like Trend Micro's Deep Discovery can detect and protect against FAKEM by identifying the patterns in its disguised traffic.
