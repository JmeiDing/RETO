The report analyzes a router malware implant named SoWaT used by the Chinese threat actor APT31. SoWaT targets Linux-based routers and functions as a remote access trojan (RAT), tunnel, and proxy. SoWaT was likely developed over several years and compiled in early 2019. It uses TLS for command and control communication, implementing encryption and verification procedures that indicate efforts to evade detection. The implant can run commands, exfiltrate files, set up proxies between the attacker and victims, and more. It relies on a custom "swt" file likely used to manipulate the router's firewall. SoWaT expects an encrypted configuration file detailing C2 servers. The report examines SoWaT's execution flow, encryption schemes, command handling, RAT and proxy capabilities, and other technical details. It assesses SoWaT has been under long development with legacy code. The sophistication shows APT31's interest in compromising routers as operational relay boxes. Detection guidance focuses on suspicious processes, YARA rules, and network signatures. The report concludes that routers remain a detection blind spot and sophisticated threats like SoWaT underline the need for better security in network infrastructure.
