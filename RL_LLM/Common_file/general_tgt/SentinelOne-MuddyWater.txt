The report from SentinelOne provides an analysis of recent activity by the Iranian state-sponsored threat actor group MuddyWater, attributed by U.S. CyberCommand to the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS). MuddyWater continues to use and evolve the Powershell-based malware PowGoop, modifying it to abuse different legitimate software to sideload malicious DLLs and evade detection. The new versions execute shellcode payloads Core.dat and Dore.dat which retrieve and execute commands from config.txt files. The group heavily relies on tunneling tools like Chisel, setting up tunnels from victim machines to command servers to mimic being inside target networks. This enables access to inner parts of networks and the tunneling of various protocols. MuddyWater was observed exploiting Exchange servers using public exploits for CVE-2020-0688 to deploy webshells, and the Ruler exploitation framework to create malicious Outlook forms. The activities demonstrate MuddyWater's persistence and continued effort to refine tools and techniques, including adopting publicly available exploits, to achieve their objectives despite lacking sophistication compared to other APT groups. Indicators of compromise and mitigation techniques for the malware variants, exploits, and tunnels are provided. The report highlights the ongoing threat posed by this Iranian actor targeting public and private sector organizations in the Middle East and globally.
