The document discusses an advanced persistent threat (APT) group called CozyDuke (also known as CozyBear, CozyCar or Office Monkeys). CozyDuke is a threat actor that became more active in 2014 and targeted high-profile victims like the White House and Department of State. The group uses spearphishing tactics to target victims, sending emails with malicious attachments that appear harmless, like funny videos of monkeys in an office. The videos covertly install malware like droppers, spyware, and backdoors on the victim's system. The malware uses anti-detection techniques to avoid security products, collects system information, and communicates with command and control servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data. The malware components share similarities with other APT malware families like MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, and OnionDuke, suggesting the authors are the same or working together. Based on the malware analysis and attack tactics, the report expects ongoing activity from this group using improved variations of the described malware. It provides recommendations for protecting against similar APT attacks through security awareness and technical protections.
