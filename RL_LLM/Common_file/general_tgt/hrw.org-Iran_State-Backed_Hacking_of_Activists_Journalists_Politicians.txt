The PDF discusses a phishing and hacking campaign targeting human rights activists, journalists, and politicians focused on Middle East issues. The campaign is attributed to an Iranian government-backed entity known as APT42 or Charming Kitten. The attacks involved sending suspicious messages over WhatsApp pretending to be from a think tank and containing links to fake login pages to harvest credentials. If successful, the hackers gained access to email accounts, contacts, calendars, and cloud storage. Researchers at Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International identified 18 additional targets beyond 2 HRW staff members. The targets included journalists, activists, and a diplomat. At least 3 individuals had accounts compromised by the phishers. Technical analysis revealed the infrastructure and tactics used in the campaign, including custom phishing pages designed to bypass two-factor authentication. Some evidence like an Iranian IP address connects the activity to Iranian threat actors. The report concludes that Iranian state-backed hacking poses serious risks to civil society groups and journalists focused on the Middle East. It recommends tech companies like Google strengthen account security protections. Overall, the report illustrates the ongoing cyberthreat posed by state-sponsored hacking campaigns aimed at high-risk groups through sophisticated social engineering.
