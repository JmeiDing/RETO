APT-28, also known as "Cozy Bear" is a state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) group that has been targeting the hospitality and tourism industry in Europe and the Middle East since at least 2016. The group has been using several notable techniques such as sniffing passwords from Wi-Fi traffic, poisoning the NetBIOS Name Service, and spreading laterally via the EternalBlue exploit. FireEye has uncovered a malicious document sent in spear phishing emails to multiple companies in the hospitality industry, including hotels in at least seven European countries and one Middle Eastern country in early July. The successful execution of the macro within the malicious document results in the installation of APT28’s signature GAMEFISH malware. The document contains a macro that base64 decodes a dropper that then deploys APT28’s signature GAMEFISH malware. APT28 is using novel techniques involving the EternalBlue exploit and the open source tool Responder to spread laterally through networks and likely target travelers. Once inside the network of a hospitality company, APT28 sought out machines that controlled both guest and internal Wi-Fi networks. This is the first time we have seen APT28 incorporate this exploit into their intrusions. Cyber espionage activity against the hospitality industry is typically focused on collecting information on or from hotel guests of interest rather than on the hotel industry itself, though actors may also collect information on the hotel as a means of facilitating operations. Travelers must be aware of the threats posed when traveling – especially to foreign countries – and take extra precautions to secure their systems and data. Publicly accessible Wi-Fi networks present a significant threat and should be avoided whenever possible.
