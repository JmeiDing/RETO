The document is about the analysis of two exploits, EpMo and EpMe, which are related to the EternalBlue and EternalRomance exploits. The authors found that these exploits exploit vulnerabilities in the DanderSpritz NtElevation API, which was supported by the Houston Disk font exploits. They also found that both exploits share a similar memory layout and use a common string "h" as the window name. The author's conclusion is that the original authors of the exploits could have been Equation Group. However, this conclusion should be taken with a grain of salt as none of the CVE-IDs were actually marked as "exploited in the wild."
