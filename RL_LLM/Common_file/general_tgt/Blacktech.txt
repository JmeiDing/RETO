The PDF describes the cyberespionage campaigns of a group called BlackTech, which has targeted organizations in East Asia, particularly Taiwan. BlackTech is connected to three malware campaigns - PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and Waterbear. PLEAD has been active since 2012, targeting government agencies and private companies in Taiwan. It uses spearphishing emails to deliver malware that can harvest credentials and documents. Shrouded Crossbow emerged in 2010 and purchased hacking tools to enhance. It targeted companies in various industries globally. Waterbear is an older campaign that uses modular malware which can be updated remotely. Analysis of the campaigns' tactics, techniques, objectives, and infrastructure links them to the same group - BlackTech. The campaigns share some of the same command and control servers. In some cases, different malware from the campaigns infected the same targets in coordinated phases. The malware uses similar techniques like disguising installers as documents. The campaigns' goal is to steal sensitive documents from targets. The type of documents stolen provides insights into BlackTech's targets - government agencies and companies in sectors like defense, technology, and more. The report recommends organizations employ layered security solutions and be proactive to detect signs of intrusion. It provides an overview of Trend Micro's security offerings that can help defend against such targeted attacks.
