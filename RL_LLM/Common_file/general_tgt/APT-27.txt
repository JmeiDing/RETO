A security researcher discovered an open repository containing malicious Android apps posing as messaging apps like WhatsApp. Apps contained RAT capabilities like device information collection, command execution etc. Communication was over port 1740. One app had a Windows executable inside that installed malware on Windows machines communicating over port 5005. Attacks seemed targeted at Syria based on language of website hosting the repo and location of C2 server. C2 server had an unusually large number of open ports - over 1300. This was likely to enlarge attack surface or operate as a honeypot. Malware capabilities and tactic similarities suggest the attack may be by an APT group, though attribution is not fully conclusive.
