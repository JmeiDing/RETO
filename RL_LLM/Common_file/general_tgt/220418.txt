The FBI, CISA, and Treasury Department have released a joint advisory about ongoing cyber threats from North Korean state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) actors targeting the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. The actors are using social engineering tactics on various platforms since at least 2020 to trick targets into downloading trojanized cryptocurrency applications for Windows and macOS. The apps are then used to steal private keys and enable fraudulent blockchain transactions. The main malware being distributed is referred to as "TraderTraitor." It contains malicious code disguised as auto-update functions that download additional payloads. Observed payloads include remote access trojans like Manuscrypt. The actors have compromised legitimate websites to host the malware. TraderTraitor variants use encryption and decryption to retrieve payloads from command and control servers. The advisory contains technical details on Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, including spearphishing, encryption, living off the land binaries, and social media impersonation. Indicators of Compromise provided include domain names, hashes, IP addresses, and YARA rules. Affected organizations are encouraged to enforce multifactor authentication, patch systems, disable macros, and educate users on phishing. Detailed mitigation strategies are also provided.
