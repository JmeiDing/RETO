This PDF document is about APT hacking, named "APT_Hackers_for_Hire.pdf". It details an attack against Autodesk's 3ds Max software that uses a special encryption method and embedded DLL files. The attackers execute malicious code by sending HTTP POST requests, and regularly sanitize some known third-party MaxScript scripts to avoid detection. The attackers had an entire toolset for powerful spying capabilities including harvesting documents, keylogging, taking screenshots and stealing browser data. The document also mentions that the attackers created a periodic task on the C&C server to download and decompress the victim's files. These files include certain tools, such as LogViewer and HddUnpacker, used to control and manage the victim's information. Additionally, the attackers used some special filenames and hashes to ensure their activities were not easily detected. Similar APT groups offering hacking-for-hire services are on the rise, representing a commoditization of APT capabilities available to the highest bidder.
