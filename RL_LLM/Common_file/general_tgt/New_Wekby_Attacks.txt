The document describes a new malware campaign by the APT group Wekby targeting a US organization. Wekby has been active for years targeting healthcare, telecoms, aerospace, defense, and tech sectors. The malware used has ties to the HTTPBrowser family and uses DNS requests for command and control. Palo Alto Networks has named this malware pisloader. The initial dropper sets persistence in the registry Run key and drops/executes the pisloader payload. The payload uses heavy obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques including return-oriented programming and garbage code insertion. Pisloader sends DNS requests with random alphanumeric subdomains to resolve TXT records that contain base32-encoded commands. It sends periodic beacons and supports commands like system info collection, file listing, upload, and command shell. The C2 server is hardcoded as ns1.logitech-usa[.]com. Pisloader is likely a variant of HTTPBrowser due to metadata, supported commands, and formatted command responses. New domains were registered for this campaign like globalprint-us[.]com hosting the droppers. Other Poison Ivy and pisloader samples were hosted on these domains. Palo Alto Networks has detection mechanisms including WildFire classification, AutoFocus tags, malicious IP/domain blocking, and IPS rules to detect pisloader. The Wekby group continues to use sophisticated techniques like DNS for C2, return-oriented programming, and anti-analysis measures. Pisloader allows them to bypass certain security products incorrectly inspecting DNS traffic.
