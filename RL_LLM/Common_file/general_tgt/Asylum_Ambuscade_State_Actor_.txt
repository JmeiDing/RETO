Proofpoint identified a phishing campaign sending emails from a possibly compromised Ukrainian military email account. The emails contained a macro document that installed a Lua malware called SunSeed when enabled. SunSeed contacts a C2 server to download additional payloads. It targeted European government personnel managing refugee logistics. The campaign shares TTPs with previous activity by TA445/Ghostwriter, but attribution remains unclear currently. The malware infection chain and targeting align with TA445's interests around refugees and NATO countries. Indicators of compromise and Yara rules are provided for the macro document, MSI installer, and Lua malware.
