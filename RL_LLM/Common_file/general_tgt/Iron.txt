The report analyzes malware developed by an Iranian cybercrime group called Iron. The group has been active for around 18 months and has created backdoors, crypto-miners, and ransomware for Windows, Linux, and Android. Researchers discovered a new Iron backdoor using leaked HackingTeam source code. The backdoor installs the Xagent crypto-miner worm or Iron ransomware onto systems. It also steals cryptocurrency wallet files and hijacks crypto transactions. The malware uses a signed Chrome extension for stealthy crypto-mining and payment hijacking. It abuses HackingTeam anti-VM checks and dynamic function calling to avoid detection. The attackers used a network of Pastebin pastes for C2. Based on forum links and Chinese language artifacts, Iron is suspected to be a Chinese group. While not the most advanced actor, the rapid development across platforms shows the group's capabilities and business model. The report includes full technical analysis and indicators of compromise.
