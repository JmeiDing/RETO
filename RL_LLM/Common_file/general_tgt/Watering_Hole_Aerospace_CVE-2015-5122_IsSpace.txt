The document describes a watering hole attack discovered by Palo Alto Networks in July 2015 targeting the website of an aerospace company. The attack exploited the recently disclosed Adobe Flash vulnerability CVE-2015-5122 from the Hacking Team data breach. The exploit delivered a malware payload called IsSpace, which appears to be an evolution of the NFlog backdoor associated with threat groups in Southeast Asia like DragonOK and Moafee. IsSpace shares code similarities with NFlog but contains some updates like additional logging and commands. The Flash exploit is nearly identical to the public proof-of-concept for CVE-2015-5122. It drops a binary called Rdws.exe in the temp folder which executes IsSpace. IsSpace gathers system info and beacons to a C2 server at 172.246.109.27. It can exfiltrate data and accept commands like file upload/download, command execution, etc. IsSpace uses a technique called side-loading to gain persistence on the infected system. On 32-bit Windows it drops a DLL and batch script to extract and load the DLL using a signed executable sysprep.exe. This gives the malware elevated privileges. The infrastructure links and WHOIS registration details for the C2 domain suggest the attack originates from threat actors in Southeast Asia, consistent with attribution for the NFlog malware. The attack demonstrates how adversaries quickly leverage new vulnerabilities and reuse effective malware code. The document highlights the need for behavior-based security controls rather than relying solely on signature-based defenses.
