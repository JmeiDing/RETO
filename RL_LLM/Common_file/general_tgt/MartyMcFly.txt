Here is a summary of the key points from the CERT-YOROI report on the MartyMcFly cyber-espionage campaign targeting the naval industry: In October 2018, the Italian cybersecurity firm CERT-YOROI uncovered a phishing campaign targeting Italian naval and defense companies. The attacker sent emails with weaponized Excel attachments that downloaded a QuasarRAT malware module. Emails impersonated vendors and suppliers in the naval industry to trick recipients into enabling macros that would execute the attack. The QuasarRAT payload is an open-source remote access tool capable of keylogging, screenshot capture, file exfiltration, and more. Technical analysis is provided on the phishing lures, macro code, anti-analysis tricks, and QuasarRAT module extracted from memory. APT groups like Stone Panda have used QuasarRAT in prior cyber espionage campaigns, but the report cannot attribute MartyMcFly to a known threat actor. Indicators of compromise are listed, including sender info, malicious documents, C2 servers, and file hashes associated with the attack. The report speculates the campaign targeted Italian naval interests for cyber espionage purposes but does not confirm the actual effects.
