The post analyzes the Win32/Potao malware family, used in targeted cyberespionage campaigns against high-value targets in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and other post-Soviet states since 2011. Potao has been delivered via phishing SMS messages and by trojanizing the open-source TrueCrypt encryption software. The trojanized TrueCrypt serves clean versions to most visitors but gives selected targets a backdoored version that exfiltrates encrypted files. While not technically advanced, Potao uses some interesting techniques like spreading via USB drives and disguising executables as Office documents. A modified TrueCrypt backdoor called Win32/FakeTC has also delivered the Potao malware in some cases. FakeTC has separate triggering logic to only steal data from long-term TrueCrypt users to remain undetected. Potao has targeted government, military, and media entities in Ukraine, while also spying on members of a Ponzi scheme in Russia and Ukraine. The full whitepaper provides further technical analysis of Potao and FakeTC's plugins, command and control communication, and additional spreading campaigns. Indicators of compromise are shared to help identify infections by this cyberespionage malware active for over 5 years.
