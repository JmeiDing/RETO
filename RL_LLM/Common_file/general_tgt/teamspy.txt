The document provides a technical analysis report by the CrySyS Lab on a malware campaign they call TeamSpy, used in targeted attacks over the past decade. - TeamSpy utilizes legitimate TeamViewer software for remote access, modified through DLL hijacking and encrypted configuration. Recent attacks were seen in late 2012. - The attacks appear to mix targeted cyber espionage with cybercrime, also potentially tied to the Sheldor banking malware campaign. - A wide range of custom malware tools exist, suggesting a small but skilled group of attackers. The tools have gone undetected for years. - The attackers have made many errors, indicating they are not afraid of being caught after long undetected activity. - Victimology and targeting of specific documents suggests high-profile victims are targeted, potentially government related. - Infrastructure analysis uncovered multiple C&C servers and campaign IDs, potentially dating back to 2004 with new activity in 2012. - Malware capabilities include keylogging, screenshotting, document stealing, system enumeration, and credential theft. Encryption is used. - Searched documents suggest an interest in diplomatic, government, and military related information. - Victim geolocation concentrated in Russia/former USSR, but international presence detected. The report provides deep analysis into the technical capabilities and infrastructure of the TeamSpy campaign, revealing its cyber espionage motivations and long undiscovered activities.
