The PDF analyzes cyberespionage activity by Chinese state-sponsored actors originating from infrastructure at Tsinghua University. The report focuses on a new Linux backdoor called "ext4" used to target Tibetan networks, as well as wider reconnaissance activities against organizations in countries strategically important to China's economic goals. Key findings: - The Tsinghua IP 166.111.8.246 conducted network scans against entities in Alaska, Kenya, Brazil, and Mongolia during periods of economic dialogue with China. The scans likely supported Chinese intelligence gathering. - Scans of Alaskan oil, gas, and government networks spiked around an Alaskan trade delegation trip to China. Targets aligned with delegation discussion topics. - Scans of Kenyan telecoms and government increased after Kenya declined a China trade deal, showing interest in the aftermath. - The IP scanned a German automaker the day after it warned of profit hits from US-China trade tensions. - The Tsinghua IP repeatedly attempted to connect to a Tibetan network compromised with the "ext4" Linux backdoor. But it did not activate the backdoor, suggesting the reconnaissance activities and backdoor presence were not linked. - "ext4" is a sophisticated backdoor that only accepts specially crafted TCP packets during a small time window. It was likely used to monitor Tibetan targets. - The reconnaissance aligns with China's intelligence activities furthering economic goals and monitoring dissident groups like Tibetans. - Defenders should block known malware and actor infrastructure, monitor for scans and C2 traffic, and use threat intelligence to identify new cyberespionage campaigns.
