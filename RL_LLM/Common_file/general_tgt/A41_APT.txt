The presentation analyzes an APT campaign called A41APT that was active from March 2019 to January 2021, targeting Japanese companies including overseas branches. The campaign leveraged vulnerabilities in SSL-VPNs for initial intrusion then used RDP for lateral movement. It deployed multi-layer malware like DESLoader and payloads such as SodaMaster, P8RAT, and FYAntiLoader. The malware was fileless, encrypted C2 communications, and deleted logs to evade detection. Infrastructure analysis found distinctive hostnames were used for initial intrusion and IP addresses rather than domains for C2 servers. There was little IP address reuse. Attribution assessment showed potential connections to Chinese APT groups APT10 and BlackTech based on malware similarities. However, specific attribution could not be made conclusively. The presentation outlines detection and mitigation measures like multi-factor authentication, patching, enhanced monitoring, payload detection, and information sharing. It notes that with vigilance, even stealthy targeted attacks can be detected.
