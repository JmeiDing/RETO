Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 has discovered a new malware family written using the Microsoft .NET Framework which the authors call “VERMIN”; an ironic term for a RAT (Remote Access Tool). Cursory investigation into the malware showed the attackers not only had flair for malware naming, but also for choosing interesting targets for their malware: nearly all the targeting we were able to uncover related to activity in Ukraine. Pivoting further on the initial samples we discovered, and their infrastructure, revealed a modestly sized campaign going back to late 2015 using both Quasar RAT (url and VERMIN. This blog shows the links between the activity observed, a walkthrough of the analysis of the VERMIN malware, and IOCs for all activity discovered.
