The document analyzes a cyberespionage campaign dubbed "Operation Honey Trap" conducted by APT36, a threat actor linked to Pakistan. The attacks targeted personnel in Indian defense organizations and government agencies over the past 3 months. The hackers used fake social media profiles of attractive women to trick targets into opening malicious attachments from emails or chats. The attachments installed a remote access trojan called Crimson RAT to steal data. The infection tactics involved sending spear phishing emails with either macro documents or ZIP archives containing the malware. The macros or archive files installed the RAT on systems. Crimson RAT can gather system info, take screenshots, search for files, and exfiltrate data to attacker-controlled servers. The RAT provides backdoor access and surveillance capabilities. While APT36 has targeted Indian strategic organizations before, this campaign notably went after eastern states of interest to China. The use of honey trapping indicates APT36 is evolving its social engineering tactics. The report highlights the need for heightened awareness given the sensitive targets and adaptability of APT36. IOCs are provided to detect malware and emails associated with the Operation Honey Trap campaign. In summary, it describes a sophisticated, targeted attack by APT36 threat actors leveraging social engineering and custom malware to compromise Indian defense and government entities.
