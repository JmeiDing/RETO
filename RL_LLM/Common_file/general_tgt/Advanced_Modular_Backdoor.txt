The document analyzes a sophisticated backdoor malware called T9000, which is a newer variant of the T5000/Plat1 malware family. T9000 has multiple stages and advanced evasion techniques to avoid detection. It can capture encrypted data, take screenshots, and target Skype users to record audio, video, and chats. The initial infection starts with a weaponized document exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The document remotely loads Flash files that use RSA and AES encryption to decrypt and execute the malware stages. After achieving arbitrary code execution, T9000 drops multiple components to disk including DLLs, EXEs, and encrypted plugin files. T9000 evades security products by checking for 24+ anti-virus products and altering installation if found. It uses Windows INF files or direct DLL injection for persistence, ensuring it loads on reboot. The core malware functionality is contained in the decrypted hjwe.dat file. This file exfiltrates system info and receives commands from the C2 server. Three main plugins extend T9000's capabilities: - tyeu.dat captures screenshots and logs foreground windows. - vnkd.dat finds files on removable drives and exfiltrates them. - qhnj.dat hooks APIs to log file/clipboard operations and encryption. The tyeu.dat plugin specifically targets Skype by using the Skype API to record audio, video, and chats after a user accepts access. Files are encrypted and saved to disk. T9000 evades analysis by encrypting payloads, deleting files after use, and checking running processes/parents against blacklists. It uses proxy-aware C2 communications to blend in. The author has gone to great lengths to avoid scrutiny. Defenses include restricting Office Flash usage, monitoring for Flash exploitation, blocking unknown encryption, and identifying unusual network patterns. Protections also include AV signatures, sandboxing, and blocking based on IOCs. Overall, T9000 shows sophisticated malware continues to leverage Flash and Office exploits for distribution.
