The PDF describes an operation called Prowli that infects servers and websites to monetize them illegally. The attackers compromise over 40,000 machines using various techniques like exploits, brute forcing passwords, and targeting vulnerable services. The attackers infect web servers running Joomla, WordPress, and other CMS platforms. They also target SSH servers, IoT devices, and servers exposing vulnerable services. The compromised machines are used for cryptocurrency mining and traffic redirection fraud. In the cryptocurrency scheme, the attackers use an automated worm called r2r2 to infect servers and mine Monero coins. For traffic fraud, they inject code into websites to redirect visitors to tech support scams and malicious sites. The traffic is monetized via a service called roi777. Prowli uses several custom malware like r2r2 worm, website injectors, and an exploit for HP Data Protector. The main command and control server is hosted on a compromised Joomla site wp.startreceive[.]tk. To detect compromises, organizations can monitor traffic to the C2 domains, scan code for snippets from injectors, and look for unauthorized cryptocurrency mining. Preventative measures include strong passwords, patching software, and segmenting vulnerable systems. In summary, Prowli is a broad campaign infecting thousands of servers for financial gain by abusing their resources. Defenses should focus on hygiene and monitoring to detect malicious activity. The report provides indicators of compromise and advice for preventing similar attacks.
