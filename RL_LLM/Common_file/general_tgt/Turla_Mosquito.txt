The document analyzes a campaign by the Turla cyberespionage group distributing malware via fake Adobe Flash installers. The installers appeared to download from legitimate Adobe URLs and IP addresses. Possible interception methods are proposed including compromising the local network, ISPs, or BGP hijacking. Adobe was not compromised directly. The installers drop Turla's Mosquito backdoor or JavaScript backdoors. They exfiltrate system info to a bogus get.adobe.com URL with a legitimate Adobe IP address. Mosquito uses custom encryption and a detailed log file. It communicates with C&C servers and can execute commands, download files, launch processes, and exfiltrate data. The JavaScript backdoor connects to a Google Apps Script web app for C2. Both backdoors achieve persistence via registry modifications and DLL hijacking. After staging data, the fake installers run a legitimate Flash installer to complete the ruse. Victims are diplomatic and government entities in former USSR states. Turla's continued innovation in distribution and covert communications highlight the group's capabilities and motivation to compromise high-value targets.
