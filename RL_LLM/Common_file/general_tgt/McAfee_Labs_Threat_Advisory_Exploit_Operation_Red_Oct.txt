The document provides a threat advisory on Operation Red October, a cyberespionage campaign targeting diplomatic and government agencies that was active since at least 2009. The attackers used spear phishing emails with malicious Office documents and Java exploits as attachments to compromise targets. The exploits dropped malware payloads that collected system information and encrypted data to send to command and control servers. The malware utilized various techniques for persistence, camouflage, and evasion. Exploits targeted CVEs in Word, Excel, Java Rhino, and other products. Two main groups of payloads were identified - one based on a batch script and encrypted DLL, the other injecting itself into processes to monitor activities. Restart mechanisms and command and control domains are provided. Statistics show the majority of attacks leveraged the CVE-2012-0158 Word exploit. Recommendations include keeping software patched, using firewalls to monitor traffic, disabling autoplay, and exercising caution with emails. The threat actors behind Red October appeared to have Russian origins based on language artifacts. The campaign demonstrates the sophistication of cyberespionage threats targeting government entities with custom malware.
