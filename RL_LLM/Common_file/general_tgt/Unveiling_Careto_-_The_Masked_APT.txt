The report provides an analysis of a cyberespionage operation called "The Mask" that has been active for over 5 years. The attackers appear to be Spanish-speaking and the campaign targets government, diplomatic, energy, and private sector entities in 31 countries. The Mask uses highly sophisticated malware tools including rootkits, bootkits, and exploits for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS. Two main backdoor malware families are used called Careto and SGH, along with a third backdoor called SBD. Careto intercepts network traffic, keystrokes, and exfiltrates documents. SGH operates in kernel mode for stealth and has extensive surveillance capabilities. Spear-phishing emails distribute the malware, often using tailored documents pretending to be news articles. An exploit server hosts various browser and plugin exploits as well as fake plugin installers. Careto and SGH communicate with command servers using encrypted protocols. Signs point to the attackers being well-resourced and able to quickly adapt and upgrade their malware. Over 380 victims have been observed, with targets in government, diplomacy, energy, and research organizations. The report provides indicators of compromise and advice for detection and mitigation. It illustrates an example of a long-running, highly sophisticated cyberespionage operation.
