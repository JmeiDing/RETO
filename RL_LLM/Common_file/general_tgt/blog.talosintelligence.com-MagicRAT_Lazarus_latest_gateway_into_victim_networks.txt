The blog post from Cisco Talos details their discovery of a new remote access trojan (RAT) called MagicRAT that they attribute to the North Korean state-sponsored cyber threat actor Lazarus Group. MagicRAT was found on victims initially compromised through exploits of publicly exposed VMware Horizon servers. It is programmed in C++ using the Qt Framework, likely to make analysis harder. It achieves persistence through scheduled tasks and contacts command and control servers for further instructions, allowing operators remote shell access and file management capabilities on infected machines. The operators can also use MagicRAT's infrastructure to deliver additional malware payloads, like a lightweight port scanner and updated versions of the Lazarus RAT called TigerRAT. TigerRAT has new capabilities like USB file dumping and skeleton code for webcam capture, though that code isn't implemented yet. Overlap between MagicRAT's infrastructure and previous Lazarus campaigns like Dtrack provides additional evidence for attribution to Lazarus. Cisco Talos assesses that the discovery of MagicRAT shows Lazarus' intent to rapidly develop bespoke malware alongside existing tools to target organizations globally.
