The PDF details the activities of a likely China-based cyberespionage threat group named BRONZE PRESIDENT that targets non-governmental organizations (NGOs), political groups, and law enforcement agencies, primarily in South and East Asia. The group has been active since at least 2014 and uses a variety of custom and publicly available hacking tools to compromise target networks and steal sensitive data. BRONZE PRESIDENT's custom tools include ORat, RCSession, and modified DLL files, while they also leverage Cobalt Strike, PlugX, WMI, and more. BRONZE PRESIDENT uses multiple directories to install tools on compromised hosts and employs various tools and techniques during multiple intrusions to understand network environments. The group gains initial access through phishing and then moves laterally across networks, collects credentials, elevates privileges, and installs tools on a large number of systems. They are adept at maintaining long-term access and have diligent operational security procedures. Some of BRONZE PRESIDENT's malware has persistence capabilities, such as using a WMI event consumer to maintain its presence on a compromised host and creating scheduled tasks to achieve this purpose. Researchers detail BRONZE PRESIDENT's tactics, malware, infrastructure, targeting, and provide indicators of compromise to help network defenders combat this threat. The report concludes that organizations should apply controls to mitigate common intrusion techniques the group leverages.
