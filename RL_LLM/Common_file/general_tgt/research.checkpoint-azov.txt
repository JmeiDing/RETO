The report by Check Point Research provides an in-depth analysis of the Azov ransomware/wiper. Azov first appeared as a payload of the SmokeLoader botnet distributing cracked software. Technical analysis shows Azov is written manually in assembly and exhibits sophisticated techniques like anti-analysis measures, polymorphic code for evasion, and backdooring of executables. It intermittently overwrites files in 666 byte blocks and adds the .azov extension. Two versions of Azov exist, an older one and a newer one that uses a different ransom note and file extension. The ransom note contains propaganda, indicating Azov is not traditional ransomware. Over 17,000 Azov-related samples have been submitted to VirusTotal. Azov does not communicate over the network or exfiltrate data. It spreads via trojanized executables and has a logic bomb set to activate wiping at a certain time. The wiping is fast and unrecoverable. The report provides IOCs, Yara rules, and screenshots of the ransom note. It outlines Azov's victimology, tactics, and capabilities at each stage. Defenders are advised to use anti-ransomware protections and threat emulation to detect Azov early before detonation. Overall, the analysis confirms Azov is an advanced wiper disguised as ransomware, aimed at destruction rather than financial gain. The report gives valuable insights to protect against this threat.
