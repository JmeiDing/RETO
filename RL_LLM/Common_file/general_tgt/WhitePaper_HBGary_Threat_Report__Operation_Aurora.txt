Operation Aurora refers to cyberattacks targeting major companies like Google and Adobe to steal intellectual property. The attacks used a JavaScript exploit in IE 6 to install a backdoor Trojan on target systems. The malware has been under development since at least 2006 and is of Chinese origin based on forensic evidence like the CRC algorithm. The command and control infrastructure uses dynamic DNS provided by a Chinese service. The initial infection downloads an encrypted dropper which installs the payload as a Windows service. The payload connects to command servers using a custom encryption scheme on port 443. The malware is controlled by operators to execute commands like stealing files or running remote commands. The full capabilities are flexible based on command numbers sent by the command server. The attacks are attributed to threat actors in China based on malware analysis, though definitive proof of Chinese government involvement is lacking. The malware economy has adopted the IE exploit for other operations. Recommended response includes blocking known command and control domains, using antivirus signatures to detect malware, and HBGary's inoculation tool to scan for and remove infections across a network. The report summarizes the technical details, capabilities, attribution and recommended response for the Operation Aurora attacks that targeted major corporations to steal intellectual property.
