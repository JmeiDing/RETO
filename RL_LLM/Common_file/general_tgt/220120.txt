The FBI has released information about a ransomware called Diavol that they first learned about in October 2021. Diavol is associated with the developers of the Trickbot malware. It encrypts files using RSA encryption and appends ".lock64" to the encrypted files. Diavol generates a unique ID for infected machines that connects to command and control servers. Once files are encrypted, the ransom note directs victims to a Tor site to pay the ransom, which has ranged from $10,000-$500,000. The FBI has not observed Diavol leaking stolen data so far. Technical details show Diavol uses specific filenames, directories, whitelisted file extensions, and PDB paths. The ransom note threatens to publish stolen data if the ransom is not paid. The FBI recommends mitigation measures like offline backups, network segmentation, account management, security awareness training, and patching. Resources are provided for ransomware prevention and the FBI encourages reporting infections to local offices. Feedback on the value of the FLASH is requested through an online survey.
