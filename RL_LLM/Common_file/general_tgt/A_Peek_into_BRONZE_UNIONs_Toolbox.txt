The article discusses research from Secureworks on the threat group BRONZE UNION, also known as Emissary Panda. BRONZE UNION is a China-based threat actor that conducts cyber espionage campaigns to collect political and military intelligence. In 2018, Secureworks observed BRONZE UNION utilizing both publicly available and proprietary tools. This included updated versions of the ZxShell and Gh0st RAT remote access trojans with added capabilities. The group continues to modify and enhance these publicly available tools. BRONZE UNION has also used custom malware like SysUpdate and HyperBro. SysUpdate is a multi-stage malware that provides remote access, while HyperBro is a proxy tool. After gaining initial access, the group relies more on widely available tools to maintain persistence. By selectively utilizing public and custom tools, BRONZE UNION can match capabilities to operational requirements, limit exposure of full capabilities, and hinder detection. The group is highly adaptable, able to bypass security controls and maintain long-term access to high-value systems. The article provides technical analysis of the group's tactics, as well as indicators of compromise including IP addresses, hashes, and malware samples associated with BRONZE UNION campaigns.
