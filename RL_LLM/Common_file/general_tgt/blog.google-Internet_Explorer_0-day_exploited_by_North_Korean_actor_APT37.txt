Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered that a group of North Korean government-backed hackers known as APT37 exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Internet Explorer to target users in South Korea. In late October 2022, TAG found malicious documents exploiting the vulnerability (CVE-2022-41128) in the JScript engine of Internet Explorer. The documents referenced a recent tragic accident in Seoul to lure targets. When opened, the documents fetched remote content that triggered the IE exploit. TAG reported the zero-day to Microsoft within hours of discovery. Microsoft released patches on November 8, 2022 to fix the vulnerability. APT37 has previously used IE exploits to target North Korean defectors, journalists, activists and others in South Korea. The exploited bug is similar to another IE vulnerability APT37 exploited in 2021. The exploit tried to avoid detection by clearing the browser cache and history after execution. While the final payload was not recovered, APT37 has previously delivered backdoors like ROKRAT and DOLPHIN for surveillance and data theft. TAG shares this research to raise awareness of APT37's tactics in the security community. Quick patching of the vulnerability prevented more widespread abuse. TAG continues efforts to improve Google product security and protect users from emerging threats like APT37.
