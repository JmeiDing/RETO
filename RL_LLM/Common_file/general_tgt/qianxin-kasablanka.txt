The cybersecurity company QiAnXin discovered that the hacking group Kasablanka conducted campaigns targeting organizations in Russia between September and December 2022. The group sent phishing emails with .vhdx virtual hard disk files attached that contained malicious payloads. The emails posed as communications related to the Russian government and current events to encourage targets to open them. The virtual disk files contained lnk files, zip files, and executables that installed remote access Trojans like Warzone RAT and Loda RAT on target systems. Loda RAT was packed in an obfuscated executable over 700MB large. It could stealthily capture screenshots, keylogs, files, and other data. Warzone RAT connected to a command and control server to allow the attackers full remote control. Earlier versions embedded the RATs directly in the Word documents. Later versions hid them in image files downloaded by the initial scripts. The PowerShell code used string obfuscation techniques to avoid detection. QiAnXin believes the attackers aim to gather intelligence and conduct espionage. While Loda RAT was previously tied to Kasablanka, other groups could be copying its code. The targeting of Russian organizations and use of the Russian language/current events suggests a nation-state actor likely conducted this campaign. QiAnXin recommends updating software and not opening suspicious emails or files.
