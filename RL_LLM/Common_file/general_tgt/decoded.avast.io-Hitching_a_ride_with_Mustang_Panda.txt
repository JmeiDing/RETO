Avast discovered a malware toolset distribution point being used by a Chinese APT group linked to Mustang Panda. The FTP server in Malaysia acts as a transition point for exfiltrated data from victims before it is moved elsewhere. The group uses tools such as USB launchers and side-loaded DLLs to infect devices and carry out malicious activities. Several gigabytes of documents, recordings, webmail dumps, and other data are exfiltrated daily from compromised targets in Myanmar. Victims include government ministries, police, military, opposition groups, NGOs, and more. Sensitive data on visa applicants, meetings, military sites, etc. was found. The exfiltrated data matches the capabilities of the modular Remote Access Trojan tools found on the server. The tools use clever techniques like side-loading for stealth. Some have not been publicly described before. Multiple links connect the tools to previous Mustang Panda campaigns. The group has previously targeted Mongolia, Vietnam, and Myanmar. The build infrastructure appears to be in the US Pacific time zone. A sophisticated JavaScript RAT was found that uses TLS client auth to communicate with a network of C2s impersonating a legitimate hosting company. Other identified C2s further link the activity to Mustang Panda. Avast assesses with high confidence the operation is still active due to the ongoing exfiltration of large amounts of data. The scale of compromised victims and sensitive data stolen indicates a highly successful espionage campaign targeting the Myanmar government and related entities.
