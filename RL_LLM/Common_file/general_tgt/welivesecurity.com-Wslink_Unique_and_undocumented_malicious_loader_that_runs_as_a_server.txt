The PDF describes a new and unique malware loader called Wslink discovered by ESET researchers. Wslink runs as a service on compromised Windows systems and listens on a specified port for incoming connections. Unlike other loaders, Wslink executes received modules directly in memory rather than writing them to disk. It uses a sophisticated cryptographic protocol involving RSA and AES encryption to securely receive and decrypt modules from a command and control server. After establishing a connection, Wslink performs an RSA key exchange to securely transmit a symmetric AES key. The encrypted module is then sent along with a signature and decryption key. The decrypted module is loaded into memory using a library and its export function executed. Modules can reuse Wslink's communication functions to send data over the existing socket. The most recent module and signature are stored globally, allowing the C2 to just send the decryption key for previously sent modules. ESET has seen limited detections of Wslink in Europe, North America, and the Middle East. The initial infection vector is unknown. Samples are packed and code virtualized, hampering analysis. No links to known threat groups have been found. ESET implemented a Wslink client to connect to a modified server and send modules, confirming the protocol and aiding detection methods. The client source code may help beginners in malware analysis by interacting with real malware functions. In summary, Wslink is a sophisticated loader implementing novel techniques like server-based module loading and an RSA-AES encrypted communication protocol. While current impact is low, its capabilities highlight continuing evolution of malware loader tactics.
