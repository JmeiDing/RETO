A new sample of ATM malware ATMitch was discovered in the wild, possibly active since 2017. ATMitch was originally revealed by Kaspersky after compromise of a Russian bank. It is manually installed on ATMs after network compromise. The sample has a custom loader that injects the payload DLL into the fwmain32 process of Wincor ATM software. Once the payload is injected into the "fwmain" process, it shows a popup window reporting the outcome of the injection phases. The final steps of an attack involving ATMitch involve connecting to the ATM machine using Remote Desktop, transferring the loader EXE, running it, deleting the initial file to remove tracks, writing commands in the appropriate file, executing new commands, and writing them in the log file. The malware can retrieve info from the ATM and dispense money usingWFSDISPENSE command. The discovery suggests ATMitch is still actively used by sophisticated attackers like Carbanak targeting banks and ATMs.
