The report by Bitdefender details the discovery of a new rootkit malware called FiveSys that has a valid digital signature issued by Microsoft. Rootkits allow attackers to gain privileged access on systems by hiding in the OS kernel. The FiveSys rootkit intercepts and redirects web traffic to malicious servers, likely for credential theft related to online games in China. Analysis shows FiveSys is similar to past malware like Undead but has new capabilities like blocking competing malware. The rootkits used in these attacks protect the malware from being detected and removed, further undermining the credibility of protection mechanisms. It is estimated to have been active for over a year, spreading through infiltrated driver files and using advanced evasion techniques. The rootkit proxies victim connections, hijacks traffic, and can deploy ransomware. The ability to get a Microsoft-issued signature helps FiveSys bypass protections. While malware abusing stolen certificates is common, directly obtaining signatures from Microsoft is rare. Bitdefender speculates requirements for Microsoft-signed drivers may aid such abuse. Revocation was requested and Microsoft revoked FiveSys' signature. But similar incidents are expected as long-running groups like FiveSys work around security hurdles. Affected organizations are advised to monitor for indicators of compromise and strengthen defenses against signed, kernel-level malware.
