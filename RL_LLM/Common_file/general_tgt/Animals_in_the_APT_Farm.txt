The document describes the activities of a sophisticated cyberespionage threat actor that Kaspersky Lab researchers have dubbed "Animal Farm." Animal Farm has been active since at least 2009 and targets a wide range of organizations globally, including government agencies, military contractors, humanitarian groups, private companies, journalists, activists, and more. Animal Farm uses several custom malware families as part of its operations, which Kaspersky has categorized into 6 groups: Bunny, Dino, Babar, NBot, Tafacalou, and Casper. Each malware family has different capabilities and is deployed at different stages of Animal Farm's attacks. For example, Tafacalou is used as an initial infection vector to then deploy more advanced malware like Dino or Babar on high-value targets. By analyzing command and control server logs, Kaspersky has identified numerous Animal Farm victims, with concentrations in Syria, Iran, Malaysia, the US, China, Turkey, and various European countries. The name Tafacalou may derive from the Occitan language and mean "so it's getting hot," suggesting the malware is heating up or escalating its attacks. Animal Farm has used at least 3 zero-day vulnerabilities over the years to distribute its malware, including via PDF and watering hole attacks. The group continues to evolve its tactics, techniques, and procedures. Kaspersky assesses with high confidence that Animal Farm operates on behalf of a nation-state sponsor based on its sophisticated capabilities and global targeting aligned with espionage objectives. Kaspersky did not attribute Animal Farm to a specific country in this report. In summary, Animal Farm is a highly capable, long-running cyberespionage actor that deploys multiple custom malware families and constantly innovates to compromise new targets globally, likely in support of a nation-state's intelligence requirements. Ongoing monitoring and research is required to track this advanced persistent threat.
