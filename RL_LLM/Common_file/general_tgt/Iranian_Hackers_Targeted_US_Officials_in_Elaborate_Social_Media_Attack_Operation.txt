The PDF describes a cyberespionage operation by Iranian hackers that targeted over 2000 individuals starting in 2011. The hackers created fake personas on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn pretending to be journalists or young women. They connected with targets like US government officials, military personnel, journalists, defense contractors, and supporters of Israel. After making connections, the hackers sent spearphishing emails to targets attempting to harvest credentials and gain access to accounts. They also used custom malware capable of exfiltrating data from compromised systems. The social engineering focused campaign managed to operate undetected since 2011. The attackers worked hours that matched schedules in Tehran. The selection of targets also suggests the activity stems from Iran. Technical indicators point to Iranian threat actors as well. The fake accounts have since been removed by social platforms. The report concludes that the unsophisticated but brazen social engineering tactics allowed the group to operate quietly for years. It serves as a reminder that human weaknesses like trust and connections can be exploited as much as technical vulnerabilities. Organizations dealing with sensitive data should be especially wary of these types of social media spying campaigns.
