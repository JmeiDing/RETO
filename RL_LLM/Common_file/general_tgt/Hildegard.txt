This document analyzes a new malware campaign called Hildegard that is targeting Kubernetes clusters. The key points are: The Hildegard malware is attributed to the TeamTNT threat actor group based on TTP similarities. It represents their shift to targeting Kubernetes vs just Docker. The attackers gain initial access by exploiting misconfigured Kubelets. Once inside a pod, they use the API to execute commands and drop payloads into containers. Payloads establish reverse shells and IRC channels for C2, spread cryptojackers, and use various tactics like library injection to hide malicious processes. Tools are gathered for container breakout, IAM credential theft, and lateral movement. Cryptomining is performed for monetary gain. The malware is under active development with frequently updated scripts, encrypted binaries, and new evasion techniques. But it already has potent persistence and spreading capabilities. Specific IOCs are provided including domain names, IPs, file hashes, and MITRE ATT&CK mappings. Recommendations given for prevention and detection. In summary, this document provides an in-depth look at Hildegard, a new and rapidly evolving malware campaign from TeamTNT targeting Kubernetes for cryptomining and potential data theft. It highlights the details of initial access, tactics, tools, command and control, and recommendations for security teams.
