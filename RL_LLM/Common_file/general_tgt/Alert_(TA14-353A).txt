Here is a summary of the key points. US-CERT was notified of cyber threat actors using destructive SMB worm malware against a major entertainment company. The malware has 5 components: SMB worm propagation tool, listening implant backdoor, lightweight backdoor, proxy tool, destructive hard drive wiper, and destructive target cleaning tool. The SMB worm spreads via brute force attacks on Windows SMB shares. The listening implant backdoor communicates over TCP ports 80, 195, and 444. The destructive hard drive wiper overwrites portions of up to 4 physical drives and the MBR, shutting down the system after 2 hours. The destructive target cleaning tool disables services and overwrites the MBR to render systems inoperable. Indicators of compromise are provided including Yara rules, network signatures, and host artifacts. Recommended mitigations include backing up critical data, restricting account privileges, segmenting networks, keeping systems patched and updated, monitoring logs, and other cyber hygiene best practices. The alert aims to provide actionable threat intelligence on the destructive malware so organizations can detect and defend against similar attacks on critical infrastructure. Rapid sharing and adoption of countermeasures is key to disrupting adversaries.
