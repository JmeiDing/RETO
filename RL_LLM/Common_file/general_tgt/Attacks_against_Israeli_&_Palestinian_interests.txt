The report details techniques used in attacks against Israeli and Palestinian interests starting in summer 2014. The decoy documents suggest political targeting. The attacks use a custom malware family called DownExecute that researchers have not seen before. It is basic downloader malware that checks for antivirus and calls home to C2 servers. DownExecute delivers second stage malware like XtremeRAT and PoisonIvy. C2 domains impersonate Israeli news outlets, suggesting targeting. An Arabic decoy document shows possible Palestinian targeting too. Infrastructure analysis shows use of dynamic DNS providers popular with Middle East groups. Hosting in Belize is unusual compared to volatile hosting normally seen. The size of the campaign infrastructure implies limited resources. The malware development approach fits known Middle East campaigns targeting the region. Defenders should look for the DownExecute malware signature and related C2 traffic. Broader monitoring for reconnaissance and custom malware is advised.
