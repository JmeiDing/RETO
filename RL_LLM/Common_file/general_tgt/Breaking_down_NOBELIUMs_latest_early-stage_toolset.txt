The document analyzes the tactics, techniques, and malware tools used by the threat actor NOBELIUM in recent phishing campaigns targeting government entities. It provides a breakdown of the four main tools used: - EnvyScout: A malicious HTML attachment that decrypts and drops an ISO file containing the next-stage malware. - BoomBox: A downloader that gathers system info, exfiltrates it via Dropbox API, and retrieves additional payloads from Dropbox. - NativeZone: A loader DLL that executes the next-stage malware component. - VaporRage: A shellcode downloader that retrieves and executes Cobalt Strike beacon shellcode from a compromised site. The tools utilize HTTPS communications and profiling of the environment before executing payloads, likely for operational security. One of their tools, VaporRage, is a unique shellcode loader used as the third-stage payload. VaporRage can download, decode, and execute an arbitrary payload fully in-memory, making it difficult to detect and analyze. The report also documents new variants of NativeZone used to load Cobalt Strike beacons, some with anti-analysis features. It provides indicators of compromise and detection opportunities in Microsoft Defender and Sentinel. Microsoft Security has observed various LNK files containing different shortcut targets and metadata variations among NOBELIUM's tools. The tools often use staging techniques on compromised websites to hide their payloads from traditional forensic investigations. In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at NOBELIUM's latest toolset, infection chain, communications, evasion tactics, and relevant detections, equipping defenders with insights to combat this advanced threat actor.
