The cybersecurity firm Recorded Future has developed new algorithms to identify and analyze influence operations on social media. Using these methods, they discovered a coordinated influence campaign called "Fishwrap" that spreads old terror news stories as if they were new, likely to provoke fear and uncertainty. Recorded Future identified over 200 social media accounts participating in Fishwrap. The accounts exhibit similarities in timing of activity, topics posted, use of specific URL shortening services, and account suspension rates. This leads Recorded Future to believe the accounts are part of the same influence operation. The influence operation uses a network of 10 URL shortening services that appear identical in design and are hosted on the same infrastructure. The URLs allow the operators to track those who click through, possibly to analyze the effectiveness and target audience. The domains are anonymously registered, making attribution difficult. Given the significant time and infrastructure investment, Recorded Future speculates this is an influence operation by a political entity or nation-state rather than individuals. The goal seems to be spreading fear by repackaging old terror stories as new news. While not outright fake news, the stories are presented deceptively via the network of social media accounts.
