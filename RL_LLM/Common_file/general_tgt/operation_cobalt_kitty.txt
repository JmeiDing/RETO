The report analyzes an advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign dubbed Operation Cobalt Kitty carried out by a threat actor group called OceanLotus or APT-C-00. The group targeted a large Asia-based global corporation to steal proprietary data. The attack occurred in four phases over more than a year. Initial access was gained via spear-phishing. The attackers first used a fileless PowerShell infrastructure with Cobalt Strike and other payloads. After being detected, they quickly shifted to custom backdoors exploiting DLL side-loading in legitimate software. The backdoors used DNS tunneling for command and control, avoiding detection by firewalls. The attackers also developed a stealthy Outlook macro backdoor for command execution and data exfiltration. Credential harvesting and lateral movement followed using tools like Mimikatz. In later phases, the attackers continuously adapted their tactics, creating new variations of tools, bypassing mitigations like PowerShell restrictions, and restoring access. Their arsenal included customized credential dumpers, obfuscators, and bypass tools. In total, over 40 systems including critical servers were compromised over the year-long campaign. The attacker's tools went undetected by traditional security products, demonstrating APT groups' capabilities to evolve and evade defenses. The report provides extensive technical analysis of OceanLotus' tactics, techniques, and procedures.
