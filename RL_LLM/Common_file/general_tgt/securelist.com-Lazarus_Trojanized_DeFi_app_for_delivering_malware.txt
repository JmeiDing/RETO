The cybercriminal group Lazarus has been trojanizing decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to deliver malware and gain financial profits. Researchers discovered a trojanized DeFi wallet app compiled in November 2021 that implants a backdoor when executed. The backdoor allows full control of the compromised system. The infection starts with a trojanized installer that drops the next-stage backdoor and a legitimate DeFi wallet app. It launches the backdoor, overwriting itself with the legitimate app to cover its tracks. The backdoor disguises itself as Google Chrome and connects to command and control servers, receiving directives to gather system info, download files, and control the victim's machine. The Trojanized application gets removed from the disk, allowing it to cover its tracks. The malware uses encrypted HTTP requests to communicate with multistage command servers hosted on compromised South Korean websites. Analysis of a command script shows overlaps with previous Lazarus malware, like CookieTime/LCPDot. The backdoor functionality and infrastructure links it to Lazarus campaigns targeting the defense industry. Lazarus continues to evolve techniques to compromise cryptocurrency and blockchain businesses, drawn by financial profits as the industry grows. The report details indicators of compromise and ATT&CK techniques used by the malware. It highlights the ongoing threat Lazarus poses to the cryptocurrency sector through trojanized apps and sophisticated backdoors for control and data exfiltration.
