Here is a summary of the key points from the report on the Sardonic and F5 malware used by the White Rabbit ransomware group: - White Rabbit is a ransomware group linked to the cybercrime group FIN8 in previous research. - Lodestone security researchers analyzed a new FIN8 backdoor called F5 that shows strong similarities to an earlier backdoor called Sardonic. - Both Sardonic and F5 use RC4 encryption for shellcode, gzip compression, and minor differences in decryption routines. F5 removed some features like process killing. - The PowerShell loader script downloads the backdoor DLL from a server using random URLs, likely indicating manual control by a human operator. - F5 checks for "powershell.exe" as the parent process, copies the LSASS access token, and connects to a C2 server after encrypting the system ID. - The White Rabbit ransomware itself is highly obfuscated, uses invalid certificates, and command line arguments to specify encryption parameters. It deletes itself after encrypting files. - Technical details, IP addresses, domains, filenames, YARA rules, and other IOCs are provided for detection of the malware and its C2 infrastructure. - The report examines the evolution of FIN8's malware arsenal from Sardonic to F5 based on code reuse and shared tactics, reinforcing the link between FIN8 and White Rabbit.
