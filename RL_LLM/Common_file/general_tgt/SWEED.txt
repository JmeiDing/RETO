This blog post from Cisco Talos exposes years of malware campaigns conducted by a threat actor they are calling SWEED. SWEED has been active since at least 2017 distributing info-stealing malware like Agent Tesla, Formbook, and Lokibot through spear-phishing emails. The campaigns rely on weaponized Office documents, Java droppers, and other attachments to distribute packed versions of Agent Tesla to victims globally. SWEED abuses known vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-8759 and CVE-2017-11882 for initial infection. Talos provides technical analysis on SWEED's evolving tactics from Office exploits to VBA macros and AutoIt droppers in recent campaigns. They use crypters, packers, and obfuscation to evade detection. SWEED infrastructure like RDP servers and DDNS domains reveal potential associates. By linking various online personas like "SWEE D" on hacking forums back to registration details, Talos believes a Nigerian actor known as "[redacted] Daniel" may be a key member of SWEED. The group heavily targets manufacturing and logistics companies in particular. The post reveals SWEED's lack of operational security over years of unchanged accounts. Talos assesses they are a relatively amateur yet persistent threat actor that continues to distribute commodity malware for financial gain. Recommended protections for customers are provided.
