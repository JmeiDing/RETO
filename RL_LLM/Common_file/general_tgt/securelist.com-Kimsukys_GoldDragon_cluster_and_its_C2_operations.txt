The report analyzes the operations and malware of an APT group called Kimsuky or GoldDragon that conducts cyberespionage campaigns primarily against South Korea-related targets. Kimsuky uses spear phishing emails with weaponized Office documents to deliver a multi-stage malware framework. Initial documents contain macros that fetch additional payloads from command and control servers. These include scripts, downloaders, keyloggers, and remote access tools. The group sets up elaborate C2 infrastructure using commercial hosting across the world. Victim traffic is carefully verified before delivering payloads. Lookalike domains impersonate legitimate software used by targets. Server-side scripts reveal tactics for evading detection and avoiding malware analysis. These include dedicated redirects and fake blogs for each target, user-agent checks, and filtering on IP addresses. Attribution suggests the group has been active since at least 2009. Historic targeting includes defectors, journalists, activists and government entities in South Korea. The technical analysis provides IOCs and Yara rules. Defenders should focus on detecting phishing lures, monitoring software deployment systems, and profiling the group's TTPs. Kimsuky continuously modifies its malware and infrastructure indicating ongoing operations. Victimology suggests cyberespionage motivations rather than financial crime.
