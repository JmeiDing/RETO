The document describes research by Palo Alto Networks into a cyberespionage campaign they call "Magic Hound." Active since at least mid-2016, Magic Hound has targeted organizations in the energy, government, and technology sectors, primarily those linked to Saudi Arabia. Magic Hound uses spearphishing emails containing weaponized Office documents with malicious macros as its main infection vector. The macros download and install various payloads like remote access trojans. Technical analysis links Magic Hound to an Iranian threat group called Rocket Kitten. Magic Hound's toolkit includes droppers, loaders, IRC bots, and the open source Pupy RAT. It uses infrastructure like compromised websites and typosquatted domains for command and control. The campaign exhibits advanced tradecraft, evolving its tactics continuously and iterating through diverse malware. The end goal appears to be espionage and data exfiltration from high-value targets. In summary, Magic Hound is a sophisticated, ongoing cyberespionage operation likely run by Iranian state-sponsored actors to steal data from organizations linked to Saudi Arabia through spearphishing and diverse custom malware. The threat actors continuously change their tools and infrastructure to avoid detection.
