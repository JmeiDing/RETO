The cybersecurity firm PwC analyzed activity from a threat actor they have named White Tur. In January 2021, PwC found White Tur using a phishing page spoofing the Serbian Ministry of Defence to steal credentials. Tracing infrastructure and techniques back to 2017, PwC found White Tur employs a variety of methods in its campaigns, including weaponized documents, HTA and PowerShell scripts, phishing lures, and modified open source tools. PwC focuses on White Tur's modification of the open source temperature monitoring tool OpenHardwareMonitor to execute payloads. The group injected PowerShell code to download malware payloads disguised as a OneDrive DLL. Another Powershell script sent system info to a C2 server before retrieving the malware. PwC also examined a Windows binary backdoor from White Tur that performed functions like file operations, command execution, and setting sleep times. While attribution is still unclear, White Tur appears focused on targets in Serbia and Republika Srpska, particularly government, defense, and research organizations. PwC aims to encourage further info sharing and dialogue on this lesser known threat actor.
