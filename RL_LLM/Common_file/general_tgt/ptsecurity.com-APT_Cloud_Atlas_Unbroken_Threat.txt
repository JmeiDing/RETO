The report from Positive Technologies provides an analysis of the cyberespionage group Cloud Atlas, which has been active since at least 2014. - Cloud Atlas uses phishing emails with malicious attachments as its initial infection vector, often using geopolitical lures relevant to its targets. The attachments contain links to download remote templates that contain exploits. - The group's tools haven't changed much over the years. They use a multi-stage infection chain involving Equation Editor exploits in Office docs, HTA files, Powershell scripts, .NET loaders, and custom malware. - The main malware payload communicates with command servers on legitimate cloud storage sites to receive modules and exfiltrate data. A recently analyzed module was designed to search for and steal documents from systems. - Encryption, obfuscation, polymorphic code, and other techniques are used to evade detection. Infrastructure domains are registered anonymously. - Cloud Atlas has targeted government and aviation entities in Russia, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Slovenia and other countries since at least 2019. Latest campaigns in 2022 suggest the group is still active. - The report provides indicators of compromise, Yara rules, detection guidance for security products, and recommendations like patching and restricting outbound network traffic to counter Cloud Atlas. - Positive Technologies predicts the group will continue evolving as its tools and techniques attract more researcher attention.
