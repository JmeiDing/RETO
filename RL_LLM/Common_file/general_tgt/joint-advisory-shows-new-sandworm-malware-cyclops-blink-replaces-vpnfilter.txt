The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have identified that a Russian cyber espionage group called Sandworm (also known as Voodoo Bear) is using new malware called Cyclops Blink. Sandworm has previously been attributed to cyber attacks including BlackEnergy in 2015, NotPetya in 2017, and attacks on the 2018 Winter Olympics. Cyclops Blink appears to replace the group's previous VPNFilter malware that was exposed in 2018. Cyclops Blink has been deployed since at least June 2019 on WatchGuard devices and uses sophisticated modular malware to steal data. It establishes persistence on devices, beacons back information, and can download additional modules. It masquerades as a Linux process and modifies firewall rules to enable command and control. The advisory provides indicators of compromise and recommends mitigations including not exposing management interfaces on network devices to the internet, keeping devices updated, using multi-factor authentication, training staff on phishing, and implementing monitoring. If organizations find they are infected, they should assume credentials are compromised, remove malware following WatchGuard's guidance, and report compromises. The malware's indiscriminate targeting means organizations infected may not have been the primary target.
