The document analyzes a new malware campaign dubbed MiniDuke that exploits a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe Reader. MiniDuke was first uncovered in February 2013 and uses spearphishing emails with malicious PDF attachments to target government organizations and think tanks worldwide. The PDF attachments exploit CVE-2013-0640 to install a multi-stage backdoor written in Assembler on the victim's system. The backdoor uses obfuscation, custom encryption per victim, and other anti-analysis techniques. It contacts command and control servers via encoded tweets from compromised Twitter accounts and fake GIFs. Multiple versions of the backdoor with varying capabilities are described, from tiny 20KB first stage implants to larger 300KB second stage backdoors sent to specific victims. The backdoors can fingerprint the system, exfiltrate documents, and download additional modules. Attacks were observed across 23 countries with 59 victims. The attackers' techniques are unusual, reminding researchers of past groups like 29A and Duqu/Red October APTs. The report concludes that MiniDuke represents an advanced threat actor but questions remain about its origins and relationship to the Itaduke attacks using the same PDF zero-day. Recommendations include applying patches and blocking domains/IPs used in MiniDuke.
