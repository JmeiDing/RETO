The PDF discusses findings by threat analyst Sebdraven on campaigns by the Chinese hacking group Goblin Panda targeting Cambodia and South Korea. Goblin Panda used similar techniques as another Chinese group, Temp Periscope, to drop malware and RATs onto victim machines. Specific findings: Goblin Panda targeted Cambodia with an RTF file that exploited a vulnerability to install a legitimate file and a new RAT malware. The RAT contacted a command and control server at weather.gbaycruise.com, which has ties to infrastructure used in attacks on Vietnam. The exploit tools, malware, and infrastructure show strong overlap between the operations targeting Cambodia and past campaigns by Goblin Panda against Vietnam. There are additional connections through domain registration patterns linking infrastructure used in the Cambodia and Vietnam attacks to Temp Periscope. An RTF targeting Cambodia contacted IP address 103.243.175.181, associated with domain chemscalere.com which was used in attacks on the Cambodian elections. The tactics, techniques, procedures, and infrastructure suggest Goblin Panda carried out these intrusion campaigns against Cambodia and South Korea, leveraging tools and techniques also used by Temp Periscope and past Goblin Panda activity.
