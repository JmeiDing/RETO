The article details updates to the Windows malware framework used by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group called APT-C-35 or DoNot Team. Active since 2016, this group targets organizations in South Asia, particularly India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, with a focus on government, military, and foreign affairs entities. DoNot Team utilizes spear phishing with document attachments exploiting vulnerabilities to initially compromise systems. Their Windows framework, also known as YTY or Jaca, has a modular architecture written in various languages. It includes capabilities like keylogging, screenshots, file collection, reverse shells, and stealing browser data. The group frequently updates their toolkit. It encrypts the victim's data and beacons back to its C2 server using AES-256 encryption with two sets of embedded keys and IVs. The post analyzes new samples showing updates to DoNot Team's framework, including: - A shellcode loader using encrypted blobs and API calls to decrypt and execute payloads. It checks for antivirus software and has fallback routines. - The main DLL component that installs persistence and beacons to the C2 server with system info. It downloads the next stage loader module. - The loader module that fetches the C2 address from Google Drive and downloads configured modules per the C2 command. - An upgraded browser stealer module that uses separate executables to steal Chrome and Firefox data. - A new reverse shell module implemented as a DLL vs an executable. Defending against sophisticated APTs requires a defense-in-depth approach. The post suggests a solution called Moving Target Defense that protects from attacks on the runtime environment without signatures or behavior models.
