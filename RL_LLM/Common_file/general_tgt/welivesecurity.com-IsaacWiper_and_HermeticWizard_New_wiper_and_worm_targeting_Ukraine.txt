The PDF describes two destructive malware campaigns targeting organizations in Ukraine in late February 2022, around the time of the Russian invasion. The first campaign on February 23 used a disk-wiping malware called HermeticWiper. HermeticWiper corrupted data on systems by overwriting the master boot record, master file table, registry files, and wiping folders. It was spread through compromised Active Directory servers and by a worm called HermeticWizard that propagated through SMB and WMI. HermeticWizard scanned for local IP addresses and used stolen credentials to spread. A ransomware called HermeticRansom was also deployed, likely to disguise the data destruction. The second campaign on February 24 used a wiper called IsaacWiper, which had no code similarity to HermeticWiper. IsaacWiper recursively wiped files on disks using an ISAAC pseudorandom number generator. An updated version with debug logs was deployed, indicating attackers were trying to understand failures. The attacks targeted multiple Ukrainian organizations and preceded the Russian invasion. The malware artifacts suggest planning for months in advance. The attacks have not been officially attributed, but the report provides technical details on the malware, timelines, and MITRE ATT&CK techniques used in the campaigns. The attacks showcase new destructive capabilities targeting Ukraine amidst the crisis.
