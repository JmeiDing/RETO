The document analyzes an Indian cyberattack infrastructure referred to as "Operation Hangover" that was uncovered during an investigation into a 2013 attack on the Norwegian telecom company Telenor. Further analysis revealed the operation had been active since at least 2010 and targeted government, military, and corporate entities, especially those related to Pakistan. The attacks typically started with socially engineered phishing emails containing malicious attachments that installed a remote access trojan on target systems. Custom malware families were developed in an apparent managed framework involving multiple developers. These included information stealers, keyloggers, and uploaders for exfiltrating data via encrypted C2 channels. Technical details are provided on the malicious tools, infection tactics, command and control, and anti-detection methods. Decoy documents were tailored to targets with regional and cultural themes. Stolen data and logs revealed a heavy focus on Pakistani interests. Code artifacts and domain registrations point to individuals and companies in India as likely developers and/or operators. While the initial Telenor intrusion appeared focused on industrial espionage, the expanded view revealed a broader likely state-sponsored campaign for strategic intelligence gathering and surveillance. The report highlights an active, organized threat actor adept at staying under the radar through sophisticated malware development and social engineering tactics.
