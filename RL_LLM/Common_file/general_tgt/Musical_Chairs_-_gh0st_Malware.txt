The PDF analyzes a multi-year cyberespionage campaign called Musical Chairs that uses variants of the Gh0st remote access trojan (RAT). Gh0st originated in China in the early 2000s and has been used in targeted attacks before. The Musical Chairs campaign has been operating since at least 2010. The attackers send phishing emails with malware attachments, relying on targets opening them rather than exploiting vulnerabilities. The emails come from compromised accounts and are blasted indiscriminately. A key server at 98.126.67.114 has been used as a command and control server for Musical Chairs since 2013. The attackers host multiple Gh0st command servers on this Windows server and frequently change the listening ports. In July 2015, the group began using a new Gh0st variant called Piano Gh0st. It uses a dropper to install and execute the RAT payload. The RAT itself is typical Gh0stRAT version 3.6 functionality. Piano Gh0st maintains persistence by adding a Run registry key and batch script to execute itself. It communicates with the command server using the magic tag "clarkclar1". While the overall motivations are unclear, Gh0stRAT provides full remote control of the system for espionage. The PDF contains indicators of compromise for the new variant and infrastructure. In summary, the analysis profiles a long running cyberespionage campaign distributing evolved variants of Gh0stRAT via large phishing campaigns. The new Piano Gh0st variant shows the group is still active.
