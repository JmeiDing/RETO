The PDF is a report from Trend Micro about a Russian-speaking hacker-for-hire group called Void Balaur. Void Balaur offers services like hacking email accounts, flooding phone numbers, and selling private data like cell tower logs and passport details. Void Balaur advertises in Russian underground forums, but also conducts politically-motivated attacks. The group has targeted journalists, activists, politicians, and others in over a dozen countries. Some victims felt so threatened they went into exile. Void Balaur's campaigns can be long-lasting, like a year of attacks on one Russian conglomerate. The group tries to get sensitive personal data, targeting telcos, banks, IVF clinics, and more. Void Balaur likely gets data by compromising insiders or exploiting vulnerabilities. Void Balaur uses custom malware like information stealers and Android spyware. The group overlaps some with the APT group Pawn Storm, sharing targets like religious leaders. But Void Balaur has more diverse targets motivated by money, while Pawn Storm focuses on espionage. Trend Micro recommends target hardening like patching and MFA. But skilled groups like Void Balaur are difficult to deter. Trend Micro suggests regulations could help curb cybermercenary activities. The report provides technical details on Void Balaur's tactics, techniques, and procedures.
