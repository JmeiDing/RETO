The document is a research paper by Trend Micro that exposes a targeted cyberattack campaign called "HeartBeat" that has been actively pursuing the South Korean government and related organizations since 2009. Targets: The campaign appears to target South Korean government organizations like political parties, media outlets, research institutes, military branches, small business groups, and government branches. This suggests the attacks may be politically motivated. Attack Vector: The attackers install a remote access Trojan (RAT) disguised as a fake document sent likely via spearphishing emails. The bundled RAT executes in the background while a decoy document is displayed to the user. Various document formats are used as lures. RAT Capabilities: The RAT allows the attackers to remotely execute commands on the infected system like uploading/downloading files, running processes, collecting system info, and opening a remote shell. It uses encryption and randomized file names to hide its presence. Command & Control: The C2 servers use domain redirection to hide the true IP locations. Compromised hosts act as proxies. Campaign codes in the RAT malware track the attacks. Attribution: The attackers appear to be English-speaking and comfortable using English in their malware code. The isolated nature of the campaign targeting only South Korean groups makes attribution difficult. Timeline: 19 sample attacks collected from Nov 2009 to June 2012, with the bulk occurring in 2011-2012. This shows the persistent nature of the campaign over years. Defenses: Blocking the RAT traffic patterns, isolating compromised systems, keeping software patched, monitoring connections, and end-user education help defend against the attacks.
