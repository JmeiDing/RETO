The PDF analyzes recent cyberattacks conducted by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group called Bahamut that has been active since at least 2017. Bahamut targets the Middle East and South Asia and is believed to operate as a cyber mercenary group. Researchers observed a phishing campaign starting in January 2022 that distributed a previously unknown Android remote access Trojan (RAT) attributed to Bahamut. The phishing sites pretend to offer secure chat software for download but deliver the RAT payload. Analysis of the RAT, which has not been publicly documented before, shows it has separate chat functionality and remote control capabilities that use the same command and control infrastructure. This suggests the malware was independently developed by Bahamut. The RAT exfiltrates extensive data from the mobile device including messages, contacts, and information from various social media and chat apps. It can also capture the device's location. Connections were made between this RAT and other Bahamut tools based on similar C2 patterns, showing the group has been active since at least October 2020. Victims are primarily located in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The report concludes Bahamut has strong malware development capabilities evidenced by this new Android RAT. Their continued phishing campaigns and evolution of tools indicates imminent cyberespionage activities likely against Middle Eastern targets.
