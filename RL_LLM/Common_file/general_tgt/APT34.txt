This PDF document is about a macro-based attack used by APT34, also known as Iran's APT34. The macros are designed to evade anti-virus software and communicate with a command and control server (C&C) through DNS tunneling. The macros drop an executable file on the target device with a "doc" extension and register a Windows schedule task to launch the file every few minutes. The C&C server sends information to the macros, which then perform various tasks such as downloading and uploading files, executing shell commands, and communicating with other servers. The backdoor in this attack uses a variant of the DNSpionage backdoor and provides functionality similar to other C-based backdoors used by APT34, such as DNSpionage and TONEDEAF. The persistence mechanism is established by the 1st stage macros, while the 2nd stage payload does not have any persistence mechanism of its own. The backdoor starts by collecting basic information about the victim's machine and calculating a 4-byte long victim identifier based on the user-name, computer-name, and domain name of the target environment. The C&C communication is HTTP-based on port 443 with port 80 as fallback. The backdoor contacts the C&C server using a GET request and returns encrypted data in the following format: /*Encrypted_Message_Encoded_with_Base64*/. The decryption key is derived from the first four bytes of the encrypted message.
