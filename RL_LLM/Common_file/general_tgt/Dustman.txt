Here is a summary of the Dustman malware analysis PDF: The report provides an analysis of a new wiper malware called Dustman used in a destructive attack targeting entities in the Middle East in December 2019. Dustman shares similarities with ZeroCleare wiper malware but has differences in techniques. The attack timeline shows the threat actor established access months prior, harvested credentials, compiled Dustman right before deployment, copied it to the victim network along with PSExec, manually deleted storage volumes, disabled antivirus, and distributed Dustman to all systems via the antivirus management console to wipe systems. Technical analysis of the Dustman dropper reveals it decrypts and drops the Eldos RawDisk driver, the vulnerable Assistant driver, and the Dustman wiper executable. It exploits Assistant to load the RawDisk driver and bypass driver signature enforcement. The wiper overwrites the target volume with a political statement. The report provides IOCs including file hashes, Yara rules, and recommendations for prevention, detection, and response. It assesses Dustman provides flexible destructive capabilities to threat actors, sharing technical aspects with ZeroCleare. The malware continues the trend of wipers like Shamoon while demonstrating the ongoing risk to Middle East entities. In summary, the report analyzes the Dustman wiper employed destructively against the Middle East, linking it to ZeroCleare while highlighting unique technical adaptations in its attack sequence and malware components. The findings aim to support defense and monitoring to detect related activities.
