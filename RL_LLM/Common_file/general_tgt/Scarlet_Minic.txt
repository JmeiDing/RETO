The document analyzes the threat group named Scarlet Mimic that has been conducting cyber espionage campaigns since at least 2009, primarily targeting Uyghur and Tibetan activists. - Scarlet Mimic uses spear phishing and watering hole attacks to infect victims with custom malware like the Windows backdoor Trojan FakeM and its variants. These attacks often involve the use of decoy documents, which are modified to appear legitimate but actually contain malicious code. FakeM is modular and uses separate loader Trojans to install itself. - The group has continuously modified FakeM to evolve its command and control communication methods and evade detection, releasing SSL, custom SSL, and other variants over time. - In addition to FakeM, Scarlet Mimic developed multi-platform malware like the CallMe Trojan for OSX and MobileOrder for Android, indicating an expansion of their tactics to mobile devices. - Decoy documents are used in the spear phishing attacks to trick victims into thinking nothing harmful occurred after infection. Analysis of the decoys shows themes related to Uyghur, Tibetan, and anti-Putin content, aligning with their likely targeting. - Recently Scarlet Mimic has also targeted Russian and Indian government organizations that track activist and terrorist groups, likely for intelligence on the activists. - Shared infrastructure links the various malware families attributed to Scarlet Mimic. The report provides technical analysis of the evolution of FakeM, the loader Trojans, and other tools used in this long-running espionage campaign. In summary, Scarlet Mimic is a persistent, modular threat group that has continuously improved its malware tools over many years to conduct cyber espionage against minority activist groups and related targets.
