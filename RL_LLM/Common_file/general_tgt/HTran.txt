The report discusses analysis of malware traffic related to the RSA breach in 2011. Researchers noticed a pattern in the network traffic that allowed them to attribute the activity to an old Chinese hacking tool called HTran. HTran is used to redirect network traffic and disguise the true source or destination. But it contains debugging code that reveals the intended destination if unable to connect. Leveraging this knowledge, the researchers surveyed network traffic and historical packet captures for the HTran signature. They identified numerous Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) malware families using HTran to bounce traffic through intermediate hosts to final hidden destinations in China. By tracing back from the observable command and control server to the final endpoint revealed by HTran's error messages, they were able to uncover the location of hidden infrastructure used in these APT campaigns. The hidden servers all traced back to major Chinese telecoms and ISPs. While attribution is difficult without further information, the findings provide valuable insight into the operational security practices of China-based APT groups. The research demonstrates how small coding errors can unravel complex network obfuscation techniques used by sophisticated adversaries.
