The PDF provides an analysis of a malware campaign called MiniDuke conducted by a threat actor group known as CozyDuke or CozyCar. MiniDuke leverages compromised websites and malicious PDFs for spearphishing attacks against government organizations and think tanks. The malware has three components - a PDF dropper, main DLL, and a payload. The PDF contains an exploit and dropper to install the main DLL component. It also contains a clean PDF to trick the user after infection. The main DLL handles command and control communications, updates, and installing payloads. The malware uses a watermarking technique to prevent analysis, encrypting Twitter account info and decrypting it based on system-specific values. It tweets encoded C2 locations, connects to download updates disguised as GIFs, and can exfiltrate data. An optional Google-based backup mechanism is also discussed. Multiple versions of the malware linked to specific Twitter accounts are listed, showing continuing development from 2011-2013. Various anti-analysis techniques like blacklisted processes and anti-VM checks are described. An examination of the backdoor payload shows its capabilities for remote control, uploading/downloading files, and command execution. The report concludes that the MiniDuke campaign shows the advanced capabilities of the CozyDuke actor. It recommends security teams implement indicators of compromise and other controls to detect MiniDuke activity.
