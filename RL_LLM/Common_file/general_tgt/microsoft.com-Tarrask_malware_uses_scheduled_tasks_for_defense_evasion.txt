The PDF describes a new malware called Tarrask used by the threat actor group HAFNIUM for persistence and defense evasion. Tarrask abuses the Windows Task Scheduler to create hidden scheduled tasks that allow it to maintain persistence on compromised systems. It deletes registry values related to the tasks to conceal them. It uses token theft to obtain SYSTEM privileges needed to delete the security descriptor value that hides the tasks. The tasks will continue running even if registry and files are deleted. When scheduled tasks are created, they generate registry keys, XML files, and Windows events that can be used to identify this technique. Enabling logging and auditing can help detect abuse. Observed Tarrask hashes and detections in Microsoft 365 Defender products are provided. Recommendations include enumerating tasks missing security descriptors, enabling task logging/auditing, and monitoring outbound connections. HAFNIUM has targeted telecoms, ISPs, and data services expanding beyond initial victims. Tarrask shows their expertise in Windows internals to hide malware activity. Defenders should be aware of scheduled tasks as a stealthy persistence method.
