The document provides technical analysis and detection guidance for the MiniDuke malware threat. MiniDuke uses exploits and spearphishing to infect victims, then installs a multi-stage backdoor for data exfiltration and further infections. It examines the known malware samples, including MD5 hashes and decryption methods. The backdoor components are written in assembler with anti-analysis techniques. Persistence is achieved via LNK files in the startup folder. The command and control infrastructure is described, including the use of Google searches, Twitter accounts, and compromised websites. Encrypted GIFs deliver additional payloads. Logs on C2s reveal 59 victims across 23 countries. For detection, the report looks at startup LNK files, running processes, initial web requests, Twitter follows, and details of the C2 traffic. Signatures are provided for the Base64-like encoded C2 URLs. The changing user agents are noted as not useful for detection. In summary, the analysis provides extensive technical details on MiniDuke's covert infrastructure and capabilities, paired with detection guidance based on its behavior patterns and artifacts. This can help security teams to identify and defend against MiniDuke infections.
