Avast discovered an APT campaign targeting betting companies in South East Asia that they are calling Operation Dragon Castling. The campaign uses a robust, modular malware toolset and infrastructure. Two infection vectors were observed - a vulnerable application (WPS Office) and a compromised software installer. The attackers exploited a vulnerability in the WPS Office updater to gain initial access. The modular toolset includes stages for escalating privileges, achieving persistence, exfiltrating data, and communicating with multiple C2 servers. Several custom plugins extend functionality like backdoors, credential access, and lateral movement. Noteworthy malware includes the Proto8 backdoor, a JSX RAT that uses TLS client auth, and the MulCom backdoor which shares code with the FFRat linked to Chinese groups. The toolset uses advanced techniques like API hooking and process injection. Attribution is made to a Chinese-speaking threat actor with moderate confidence based on code overlaps with known China-linked malware. The targeting of gambling firms suggests a criminal motivation, but the end goal is unclear. Avast speculates the attackers may be after financial data or insider information based on the targeting. The campaign infrastructure remains active indicating ongoing operations. The public disclosure of the discovered WPS Office vulnerability has allowed it to be patched.
