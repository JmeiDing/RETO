The document analyzes a malware tool called STEELCORGI used by an APT group TH-239 to conduct cyberespionage campaigns. STEELCORGI is an ELF binary that contains a sophisticated toolkit for reconnaissance, lateral movement, exploitation, and post-exploitation activities. The malware uses complex packing and obfuscation techniques to avoid detection, including encrypted strings, anti-reverse engineering tricks, and requiring a custom environment variable set by the operators to decrypt and execute the payload. Once running, STEELCORGI has an extensive menu of over 80 built-in commands for functions like network scanning, password cracking, cleaning logs, spoofing network traffic, opening remote shells, and more. It allows the threat actor to thoroughly infiltrate a network and operate undetected. The report examines the unpacking process, decrypted contents, and capabilities in detail. It reveals how advanced malware like STEELCORGI equips sophisticated APT groups with expansive access to compromised networks via a single compact package. The report aims to expose the tool to help defenders guard against such multifaceted threats.
