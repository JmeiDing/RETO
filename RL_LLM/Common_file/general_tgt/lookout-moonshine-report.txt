The report analyzes two new surveillance campaigns targeting Uyghurs - one using a novel Android spyware called BadBazaar, and the other using updated versions of the MOONSHINE malware initially uncovered by Citizen Lab in 2019. BadBazaar impersonates legitimate apps and can exfiltrate extensive device data back to its command and control server. Over 100 samples have been found distributed via Uyghur social media channels. Infrastructure links it to the APT15 Chinese threat actor. The updated MOONSHINE variants spoof social and religious apps to distribute surveillance capabilities via additional modules. Ongoing campaigns distribute it on Uyghur channels on Telegram and other platforms. Attributor clues suggest a Chinese entity is behind this new activity. Both malware families add to the suite of tools used in extensive surveillance and suppression campaigns against the Uyghur population, both in China and abroad. Their continued development and distribution via Uyghur social media indicates the threat actors have infiltrated these communities. The report examines the infection tactics, capabilities, infrastructure, and attribution clues uncovered during analysis of BadBazaar and the new MOONSHINE variants. It concludes by emphasizing the ongoing nature of these campaigns and the need for awareness and protective measures among vulnerable populations. In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at two new sophisticated malware campaigns targeting the Uyghur community via compromised social platforms and trojanized apps. It highlights the urgent need to defend against such intrusive mobile surveillance.
