The PDF discusses an analysis by Trend Micro of a targeted cyberattack campaign called Operation Pawn Storm. The attackers used a new zero-day exploit in Java to infect victims' machines. The infection happened in multiple stages: 1. The victim received a spearphishing email containing a malicious URL. When clicked, the URL hosted an exploit that downloaded malware onto the victim's machine. 2. The initial malware was a PE file that extracted and loaded a DLL file. This DLL collected system information and sent it to a command and control server. 3. In the second phase of the attack, the malware would download additional components like a keylogger to gather sensitive information from the infected machine. The targets appeared to be government, military, and defense contractors in the US and Canada. Trend Micro was able to detect the different stages of the attack through malware behavior analysis and browser exploit prevention features. They released protections for the attack and Oracle patched the Java vulnerability. The report provides in-depth technical details on how each stage of the attack worked and indicators of compromise for security teams to look for. It demonstrates the ongoing threat of targeted cyberattacks and how attackers are using zero-day exploits combined with malware toolkits.
