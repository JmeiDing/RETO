The report details a watering hole campaign targeting iOS and Android users in Hong Kong by distributing malware through links posted on forums and Telegram. The iOS links go to sites with iframes that exploit vulnerabilities in iOS 12.1 and 12.2 to install a new iOS malware called lightSpy. It's a modular backdoor that can exfiltrate data like contacts, messages, photos, location, etc. and allow remote command execution. The Android links distributed a malware called dmsSpy masquerading as protest schedule apps. It can steal SMS, contacts, files, location data, etc. The attacks used compromised news sites and fake news links as lures, hence the name "Operation Poisoned News." The goal seems to be compromising as many devices as possible rather than targeted individuals. Links were posted on Hong Kong forums from new accounts. The articles used headlines on generic topics like COVID-19 or clickbait to attract clicks from forum users in general. Technical details show the iOS exploit chain, modules of lightSpy, C2 connections, and more. dmsSpy capabilities gained from a debug mode mistake. Same actor likely behind both based on infrastructure overlaps. The report suggests keeping devices updated, not installing from untrusted stores, and using mobile security solutions as defenses against such watering hole attacks.
