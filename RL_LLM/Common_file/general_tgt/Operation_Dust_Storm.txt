The report by Cylance details the activities of a threat group they call Operation Dust Storm, attributed to North Korea. Active since at least 2010, the group has targeted government, defense, and critical infrastructure organizations in Japan, South Korea, the US, and Southeast Asia. The group uses evolving tactics like spear phishing, watering holes, and zero-days to distribute custom malware like Misdat and S-Type backdoors for surveillance and data theft. After laying low 2013-2014, Dust Storm resurfaced with a focus on compromising Japanese critical infrastructure targets in finance, transportation, oil/gas, electricity, and construction sectors. The report analyzes Dust Storm's tactics over time, from basic backdoors to sophisticated malware propagating through multi-stage loaders and leveraging proxy servers at victim firms. It outlines the group's infrastructure and provides indicators of compromise for security analysts. While not overtly destructive yet, Cylance concludes that Dust Storm poses an advanced persistent threat through its stealthy surveillance campaigns against Asian targets. In summary, the report provides a comprehensive look at Operation Dust Storm, a decade-long cyberespionage effort attributed to North Korea that has evolved to target critical infrastructure and resources in Japan, infiltrating companies via customized malware tools and infrastructure.
