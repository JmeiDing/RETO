The PDF describes analysis of a malware called Jolly Jellyfish by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). Jolly Jellyfish is a downloader that retrieves shellcode embedded in bitmap (BMP) image files over HTTP. The shellcode is a Cobalt Strike stager. It extracts the shellcode by reading every 4th byte from the pixel data in the BMP file. This steganography hides the shellcode while keeping the image valid. Some variants display bogus error message boxes, download legitimate files, and contain anti-sandbox techniques to evade detection. PDB paths suggest the malware is referred to internally as "fishmaster". Attribution is unclear but overlaps were found with another Cobalt Strike sample using the same C2 domain. While basic, the steganographic technique shows creative ways attackers try to hide communications. The PDF provides Yara rules, IoCs, and recommendations for detecting Jolly Jellyfish. It demonstrates attackers continually evolve techniques and malware to avoid defenses, requiring ongoing vigilance.
