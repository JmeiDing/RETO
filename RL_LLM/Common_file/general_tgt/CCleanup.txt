The document describes analysis by Talos of malware found embedded in version 5.33 of the CCleaner software distributed by Avast. The legitimate signed CCleaner installer also installed a multi-stage malware payload. The payload was responsible for decrypting and executing two stages of the malicious code: a PIC (Position Independent Code) PE loader and a DLL that effectively functioned as the malware payload. When run, the malware contacted a command and control server, profiled the infected system, and selectively delivered additional payloads to specific organizations including technology companies. The C2 server filtered systems based on target domains. The malware gathered extensive system info and tried to evade detection by waiting 10 minutes before continuing execution. It checked for admin privileges before installing the next stage payload from encrypted code. A payload DLL used obfuscation tricks and executed additional modules from the registry using trojanized binaries signed with stolen certificates. The modules connected to other C2s, downloaded more malware, and established persistence. Over 700,000 systems connected to the C2 server during September, with more than 20 receiving the 2nd stage payload before the server was taken down. The malware had a DGA failover mechanism for C2 comms. The attack potentially affected over 2 billion systems given CCleaner's high distribution. Talos recommends impacted users restore from backups rather than just upgrade CCleaner. Virus detection remains very low for this threat.
