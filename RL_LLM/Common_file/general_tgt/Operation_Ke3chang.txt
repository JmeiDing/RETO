The report describes a cyberespionage operation called Operation Ke3chang conducted by a China-based threat actor group. Researchers discovered the group has evolved its malware arsenal and is using a new backdoor family called TidePool. The TidePool malware was used in attacks against Indian embassy personnel worldwide. The attacks involved weaponized documents exploiting the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability. Analysis uncovered similarities between TidePool and the BS2005 malware used previously by the Ke3chang group. The malware functionality includes gathering system info, reading/writing files, running commands, and exfiltrating data. The group continues to target organizations in sectors like government, technology, and telecommunications for espionage purposes. Research traced the malware evolution from samples before and after the 2013 Ke3chang report. Code reuse, registry modifications, C2 traffic, targeting, etc. provided evidence linking TidePool to the BS2005 malware. The ongoing attacks show Ke3chang remains active despite lack of public reporting. In summary, the threat actor group behind the Operation Ke3chang cyberespionage campaign evolved its tools over time but continues similar targeting. The new TidePool backdoor has ties to their previous BS2005 malware based on code reuse and behaviors. The group remains a threat with its compromise of Indian embassies using updated malware.
