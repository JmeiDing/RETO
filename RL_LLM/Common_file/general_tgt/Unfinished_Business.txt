The report describes the activities of a financially-motivated threat actor group called FIN4 that has targeted organizations in the financial, healthcare, and pharmaceutical industries since 2013. FIN4 uses phishing emails with malicious Office documents to harvest user credentials. They also create phishing pages mimicking Outlook Web App login pages. Researchers discovered FIN4 also uses a custom VB.NET backdoor malware called UpDocX for keylogging and stealing documents. UpDocX has limited functionality but contains extensive cleanup routines to delete evidence of compromise. It uses URLDownloadToFile to download the payload from a command and control server. The malware author may be a French speaker based on naming conventions. There was no attempt to obfuscate the source code or network traffic. FIN4 has specifically targeted senior executives and consultants at victim organizations to steal sensitive business information and secrets. Over 100 companies have been affected, primarily NASDAQ and NYSE listed firms. The group has been active since at least 2013 and has been previously reported on by security firms like FireEye, Symantec, and Esentire. Their campaigns demonstrate patience, sophistication, and intimate knowledge of targeted industries.
