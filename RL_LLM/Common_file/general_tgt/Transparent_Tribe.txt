The PDF describes an analysis by Kaspersky of the Transparent Tribe APT group, which has been active since at least 2013 targeting Indian military and government personnel. Kaspersky found a new Android implant used by Transparent Tribe distributed via fake porn and COVID-19 tracking apps. The implant is a modified version of the open-source AhMyth RAT that allows remote control of devices. It has enhanced audio surveillance capabilities and can steal contacts, messages, photos, and documents. The malware retrieves its C2 server from a configuration file hosted on a domain registered by the attackers. Kaspersky also found the group distributing ObliqueRAT, another new .NET tool attributed to Transparent Tribe. The PDF provides indicators of compromise including file hashes, C2 URLs, and domain names associated with the group's infrastructure. It also outlines the social engineering used in their spear phishing campaigns, such as aviation-themed document lures. Kaspersky concludes that Transparent Tribe continues to develop new tools and shows no signs of slowing down. They recommend continued monitoring of the group's activities and have released full IOCs and YARA rules to their threat intelligence customers.
