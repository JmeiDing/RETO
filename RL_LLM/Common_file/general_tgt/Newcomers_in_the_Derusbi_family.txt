The document analyzes two new variants of the Derusbi remote access Trojan (RAT) malware family - a Windows x64 kernel driver and a Linux shared library. Derusbi is a continuously evolving RAT used in APT attacks since 2008. It has client and server variants. The new Windows driver variant uses stolen certificates to sign the malware. It has rootkit capabilities to hide files and network connections. It injects a DLL into svchost.exe for RAT capabilities like command execution, keylogging, and VPN. The driver disables debugging, hooks filesystem and network APIs to hide artifacts, and uses APC queue to inject the DLL. The DLL uses named pipes for kernel communication and embeds other PE files for specific tasks. The Linux variant pretends to be a PAM library but exports the Derusbi server behavior. It listens on a port, communicates via the Derusbi protocol, and has modules for command execution, files, and proxy. It drops a kernel rootkit module for hiding. Both variants reuse code from other Derusbi versions. The Linux code contains debugging symbols revealing a Windows to Linux API wrapper framework. Derusbi continues to expand into new OS variants while adding features. The Linux version shows APT groups have interest in compromising Linux systems. More Linux malware investigation tools are needed to respond.
