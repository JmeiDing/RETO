The report by Bitdefender provides an analysis of a new backdoor named Sardonic used by the FIN8 cybercrime group in attacks against financial institutions. Sardonic is delivered via multiple stages of PowerShell scripts and .NET loaders that provide persistence using WMI and evade detection. The final Sardonic backdoor communicates over port 443 with attacker command and control servers using an encrypted binary protocol. It can execute commands, collect system info, and run malicious plugins downloaded from the C2. While still in development, Sardonic already has potent capabilities for carrying out espionage and data theft. FIN8 continues to evolve their tactics, with this backdoor being more stealthy and agile than past tools. The group is known for targeting the retail, hospitality, and financial sectors. Indicators of compromise are provided, and organizations are advised to monitor for activity by separating networks, training staff, and integrating threat intelligence. Overall, the report reveals the growing sophistication of targeted malware, requiring constant vigilance.
