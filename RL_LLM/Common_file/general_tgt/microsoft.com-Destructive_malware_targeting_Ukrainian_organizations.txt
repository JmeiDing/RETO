The document describes destructive malware activity targeting organizations in Ukraine that was identified by Microsoft on January 13, 2022. The malware overwrites the Master Boot Record (MBR) of devices to display a fake ransom note, but lacks any actual ransom recovery mechanism. Microsoft assesses that the malware is intended to be destructive rather than obtain a ransom, with the goal of rendering targeted devices inoperable. Dozens of systems across government, non-profit, and IT organizations in Ukraine have been impacted so far. The malware has two stages - first overwriting the MBR with a fake ransom note, then downloading a corrupting component that locates and overwrites files with certain extensions to make them inaccessible. Indicators of compromise like file hashes, command lines, and the hardcoded Bitcoin wallet are provided. Microsoft has implemented detections for the malware, which they track as WhisperGate, in Defender products. Recommended actions for organizations include investigating IOCs, reviewing remote access logs for anomalies, enabling multifactor authentication, and using features like Controlled Folder Access to block file modifications. The activity is attributed to a new temporary cluster DEV-0586, with no known associations to existing groups. The investigation is ongoing and Microsoft is sharing information to help organizations defend against this threat. In summary, the document provides details on new wiper malware used in intrusions targeting Ukraine, along with mitigation advice and IOCs to facilitate detection and response.
