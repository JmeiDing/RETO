The report provides an overview of a cyberespionage campaign named LightSpy that targeted iOS devices. It details the exploits, implants, infrastructure, and attribution of the threat actors behind the campaign. The key points are: In January 2020, a watering hole site was found exploiting a full iOS remote exploit chain to deploy LightSpy malware. The site targeted Hong Kong users. LightSpy is a feature-rich iOS implant capable of extensive surveillance of an infected device. Its capabilities include location tracking, audio recording, file exfiltration, and more. The threat actor made rapid modifications to exploit chain components in February and March 2020, expanding iOS version support. LightSpy components were also updated frequently. Various social media platforms and communication channels were abused to direct targets to the exploit sites. Iframes on legitimate news sites redirected visitors invisiblely. Investigation of the command and control infrastructure revealed an admin panel, clues about other targeted platforms like Android, and potential connections to a previously known Chinese APT group. An Android implant was also found downloading from a subdomain associated with LightSpy infrastructure. Links between the Android malware and the APT group were discovered. The report concludes that LightSpy exemplifies an agile development and deployment approach for mobile surveillanceware. Defenders are advised to monitor for the associated indicators of compromise.
