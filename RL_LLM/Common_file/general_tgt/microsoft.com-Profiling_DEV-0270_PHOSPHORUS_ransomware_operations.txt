The PDF describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by the Iranian threat actor group DEV-0270 (also known as Nemesis Kitten), which is linked to the state-sponsored group PHOSPHORUS. DEV-0270 typically gains initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities like ProxyLogon in Exchange servers or CVE-2018-13379 in Fortinet devices. They use living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) like WMI and PowerShell for discovery and credential access. For persistence, they create accounts like DefaultAccount, enable RDP, and use scheduled tasks. They escalate privileges using credential dumping, account creation/modification, and masquerading binaries as legitimate processes. For defense evasion, they disable security services, use LOLBins, spoof certificates, and masquerade tools. They move laterally via RDP and WMIExec. For impact, they use BitLocker and DiskCryptor to encrypt devices for ransom. They have demanded around $8,000 in ransom payments. If organizations don't pay, they may leak stolen data. Microsoft provides extensive hunting queries and detection details to identify this activity across Defender for Endpoint, Sentinel, and Microsoft 365. They recommend applying patches, restricting lateral movement, enforcing strong passwords, and enabling antivirus/EDR monitoring.
