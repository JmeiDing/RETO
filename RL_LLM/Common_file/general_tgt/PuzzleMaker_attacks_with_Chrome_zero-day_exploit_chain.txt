The PDF describes a cyberattack campaign by a threat actor dubbed PuzzleMaker that exploited multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows. The attacks occurred in April 2021 and targeted multiple companies. The initial intrusion vector was through Chrome using a JavaScript-based remote code execution exploit, likely targeting CVE-2021-21224 which was fixed on April 20. This allowed escape from the Chrome sandbox. An elevation of privilege exploit was then used to gain system privileges in Windows. It exploited CVE-2021-31955, an information disclosure vulnerability, to get kernel addresses. It also used CVE-2021-31956, a heap overflow in ntfs.sys, along with Windows Notification Facility (WNF) to create arbitrary memory read/write primitives. Four malware modules were part of the full attack chain - a stager, dropper, service, and remote shell. The stager notified of success and downloaded the dropper. The dropper installed the service and remote shell. The remote shell communicated with a command and control server. The malware artifacts did not have strong connections to known threat groups. Kaspersky labeled the actor PuzzleMaker. The attacks appeared highly targeted based on victimology. Kaspersky detected the attacks using behavioral analysis and exploit prevention capabilities. They reported the Windows vulnerabilities to Microsoft which issued patches in June 2021. The PDF contains IOCs and detection info for defenders.
