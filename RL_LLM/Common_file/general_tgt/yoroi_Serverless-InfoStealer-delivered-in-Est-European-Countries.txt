The PDF is a report by Yoroi about malware campaigns conducted by a threat actor group they track as Aggah (TH-157). Aggah has been active since at least 2019 conducting worldwide campaigns to steal sensitive information. In November 2021, Yoroi discovered a new Aggah campaign targeting hundreds of victims in Ukraine, Lithuania, Italy, and other countries. The campaign lasts 2 months and uses an information stealer called AgentTesla delivered via multi-stage malware infection chains. The initial infection starts with a weaponized PowerPoint document. When closed, it executes a macro that eventually downloads AgentTesla payloads from Bitbucket code repositories. AgentTesla gathers sensitive data like credentials, keystrokes, screenshots, etc. Aggah abuses Bitbucket to host AgentTesla variants and evade detection. Yoroi tracks 30+ different AgentTesla payloads across two Bitbucket accounts used by Aggah. Many targets are in Eastern European countries. Yoroi notes that Aggah can quickly modify tactics, using things like scheduled tasks and public hosting for resilience. They advise advanced detection methods like sandboxing and network monitoring to counter skilled adversaries like Aggah. The report contains IOCs for the campaign.
