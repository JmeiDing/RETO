The document describes research by cybersecurity firm Sansec that links digital payment skimming attacks against US and European online retailers to North Korean state-sponsored hackers. Since May 2019, the North Korean hacker group HIDDEN COBRA has been breaching the systems of major retailers and injecting payment skimmers to intercept customer credit card data during checkout. Sansec attributed the skimming activity to HIDDEN COBRA based on code similarities and infrastructure links to previous North Korean operations. The skimmers exfiltrate stolen payment data to compromised sites like a modeling agency and music store. This represents an expansion of North Korean cyber operations beyond traditional targets like banks and cryptocurrency exchanges. The skimmers are injected after HIDDEN COBRA gains access to retailer servers through means like phishing. The skimmers capture payment data and exfiltrate it via fake image requests to avoid detection. In total, Sansec found dozens of compromised retailers linked to HIDDEN COBRA's skimming infrastructure and code fingerprints. The North Korean group is now competing directly with Eastern European cybercriminals in the profitable activity of payment skimming, demonstrating their continued growth in cyber capabilities.
