The PDF describes research by ESET on a new wiper malware called Fantasy that was deployed via a supply-chain attack by the threat actor group Agrius. Agrius abused an Israeli software developer's update mechanism to distribute the Fantasy wiper to customers in the diamond industry. The campaign began with reconnaissance activities in February 2022 at a South African diamond industry organization. Then on March 12th, Agrius deployed the Fantasy wiper and a lateral movement tool called Sandals to victims in South Africa, Israel, and Hong Kong over the span of around 3 hours. Fantasy is based on Agrius's previous wiper Apostle but does not disguise itself as ransomware. It recursively overwrites files on fixed drives with random data before deleting them. Sandals uses stolen credentials to spread Fantasy batch files to systems on the network via SMB and PsExec. Analysis shows Fantasy shares much code with Apostle. Both were written in .NET C# and have very similar functions for listing directories, deleting files, and more. Fantasy still contains remnants of Apostle's execution flow requiring an encoded XML key parameter. The supply-chain attack through the software updater allowed wide distribution of Fantasy across many customers of the developer. Though destructive, the attack was contained quickly, with ESET blocking Fantasy executions within hours. The developer also pushed out clean updates to end the campaign.
