The document is a threat intelligence report on an advanced cyber threat actor group named Callisto Group. Callisto Group has been active since at least late 2015 targeting military, government, think tanks, and journalists in Europe and South Caucasus. Their goal appears to be intelligence gathering on foreign and security policy in Eastern Europe and South Caucasus regions. The group uses a two phase attack: 1. Credential phishing - Emails pretending to be from Google claiming the target's account will be deleted unless they enter credentials on a fake login page. 2. Spear phishing - Spoofed emails sent from compromised accounts with malicious document attachments containing malware. The malware is a version of the Scout tool from the leaked HackingTeam Galileo remote access toolkit. The spear phishing emails are highly targeted and convince the target to open the document attachment. Execution of the embedded malware requires the target to actively enable it. Once a computer has been compromised, the malware will disrupt the attacker's ability to control it. The report contains indicators of compromise and recommendations for identifying, mitigating, and remediating the threat. Suggested actions include enabling two-factor authentication, not reusing passwords, and having robust antivirus tools. Callisto Group is assessed to still be active and setting up new phishing infrastructure regularly. Their motives are intelligence gathering rather than financial. The report is unable to definitively attribute the group but suggests potential nation-state sponsorship.
