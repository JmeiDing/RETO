The PDF describes the emergence of a new malware threat called SQUIRRELWAFFLE that is being spread through spam email campaigns. SQUIRRELWAFFLE provides an initial foothold on systems that can then be used to install additional malware like Qakbot and Cobalt Strike. The campaigns started in mid-September 2021 and leverage stolen email threads, replying to them with malicious links to ZIP archives containing weaponized Office documents. The emails are localized based on the original language. The malicious documents contain macros or scripts that download and execute the SQUIRRELWAFFLE payload, which is a DLL that functions as a malware loader. The infrastructure uses compromised WordPress servers and techniques like IP blocklists and ANTIBOT to evade analysis. The DLL payload communicates with a C2 server using obfuscated HTTP requests to exfiltrate system info and receive commands. SQUIRRELWAFFLE has been used to deliver Qakbot and Cobalt Strike in follow-on infections after the initial compromise. The PDF provides technical details on the infection process, document macros, C2 communications, and distribution infrastructure. It concludes that organizations should employ defense-in-depth security to prevent, detect, and respond to SQUIRRELWAFFLE campaigns as this threat is expected to persist. Indicators of compromise and detection signatures are provided.
