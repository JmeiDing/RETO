The PDF describes research conducted by RSA Incident Response on an advanced hacking group they call Shell_Crew. Shell_Crew typically breaches networks by exploiting vulnerabilities in externally facing servers. Once inside, they use various techniques to maintain access including web shells, registering DLLs with IIS, and modifying system files. Shell_Crew uses custom malware like Trojan.Derusbi variants that communicate via encrypted proprietary protocols to avoid detection. They also leverage tools like Credential Logger DLLs injected into LSASS for stealing credentials. For detection, the research found forensic footprints like specific folders used and timestomping files. Yara rules, Security Analytics parsers, and ECAT can also detect Shell_Crew activity through signatures and network connections. In summary, the report provides an ethical profile of Shell_Crew's tactics, tools, infrastructure, and recommendations for detection. It aims to help security teams recognize and block this sophisticated group. The attached appendix provides technical details to support investigation and monitoring.
