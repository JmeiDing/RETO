Recorded Future developed new techniques to detect influence operations on social media. They identified a campaign dubbed "Fishwrap" that posts old terror attack news as if it were new. Fishwrap uses 10 URL shortener services that share code and infrastructure to track effectiveness. Over 215 accounts were analyzed participating in Fishwrap across different time periods. The accounts show similarities in topics, URLs, temporal behavior, and account names. This indicates they are part of the coordinated influence operation aimed at spreading fear. While attribution is difficult due to anonymous domain registration and fictive accounts, the sophisticated tracking and duration over a year point to an organization with intent to target audiences. By repurposing real but old terror news, Fishwrap avoids automatic detection and suspension. The research demonstrates new ways to identify coordinated influence campaigns and shed light on their techniques.
