 The document analyzes the long-running hacktivist rivalry between Indian and Pakistani hackers. This cyber conflict mirrors the broader geopolitical tensions between the two countries. High-profile events like cricket matches, independence days, and terror attacks consistently spark waves of hacktivist activity. Hackers deface websites, leak data, and take sites offline as retaliation for perceived slights or violence by the other side. Groups like the Pakistan Cyber Army have targeted major Indian corporations, government agencies, and infrastructure since at least 2007. Their tactics include phishing, SQL injection, and exploiting vulnerabilities. Some hackers operate independently while others may have state sponsorship. Indian hacker collectives like the Indian Black Hats and Mallu Cyber Soldiers reciprocate by hacking Pakistani sites. They use similar techniques like SQL injection against vulnerable web applications. In summary, nationalist hacking between India and Pakistan flares up around events like cricket matches, national holidays, and terror attacks. The two sides engage in back-and-forth website defacements, data leaks, and denial-of-service attacks, with minimal lasting damage. The online rivalry mirrors deeper conflicts but has so far remained at the hacktivist level.
