The PDF provides an analysis of a cyberespionage group called MuddyWater that has been actively targeting victims primarily in the Middle East during 2017. MuddyWater uses phishing emails with macro-enabled Office documents to infect victims with a PowerShell backdoor called POWERSTATS. This backdoor connects to command and control servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data. The group constantly changes infrastructure and adapts techniques to evade detection, such as moving from GitHub to Pastebin for hosting payloads. They have expanded targeting beyond the Middle East to countries like India and the US. The PDF examines the evolution of MuddyWater's tactics from the first public reports in September 2017 through November 2017. It tracks the changes in C2 servers, proxy sites, malware delivery methods, and backdoor code. While some have attributed MuddyWater to the FIN7 cybercrime group, the PDF argues this link is questionable and they are more likely a separate espionage-motivated group, based on distinct targeting, infrastructure, and malware. MuddyWater heavily targets the government, telecoms, and oil sectors in countries like Iraq, Saudi Arabia, UAE. The PDF speculates the group could originate from Iran based on infrastructure clues, but definitive attribution is difficult. In summary, the analysis profiles the tactics, infrastructure, targeting, and capabilities of the MuddyWater APT group as an active threat conducting cyberespionage in the Middle East in 2017. It tracks the group's evolution and argues against attribution to FIN7.
