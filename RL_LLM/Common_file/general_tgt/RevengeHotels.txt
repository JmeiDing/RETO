The PDF describes a malware campaign called RevengeHotels that targets hotels, hostels, and hospitality companies globally but primarily in Brazil. The goal is to steal credit card information from hotel systems and from major online travel agencies like Booking.com. The main attack method is spear-phishing emails with malicious Word, Excel, or PDF files attached that have exploits to install remote access trojans like RevengeRAT on target systems. The malware specifically captures credit card data entered on certain web pages or printed/copied to the clipboard. The attackers also sell access to infected hotel systems on criminal forums, acting as "concierges" for other cybercriminals to steal data. The campaign has been active since at least 2015 but increased attacks in 2019. Kaspersky has identified at least two groups involved, named RevengeHotels and ProCC. Confirmed victims span 13 countries across North/South America, Europe, and Asia, but the campaign's global reach is likely much wider based on distribution data. Kaspersky recommends virtual/temporary payment cards and mobile payment systems when booking hotels to protect against this threat.
