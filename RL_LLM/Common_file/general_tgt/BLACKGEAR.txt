The document analyzes the BlackGear espionage campaign, which has been targeting users in Taiwan for years using the ELIRKS backdoor. Researchers found that BlackGear has evolved and started targeting Japanese users as well. The malware uses a three-stage process - binders, downloaders, and backdoors. Binders are delivered via phishing/watering holes and execute decoys and downloaders. Downloaders connect to attacker sites and download backdoors which provide persistent access. The backdoors retrieve encrypted command and control (C2) instructions from blogs/microblogs. This hides C2 traffic as normal blog traffic. The backdoors can exfiltrate data, take screenshots, download files, and open remote shells. Analysis revealed connections between the tools - same log filenames, overlapping encryption keys, etc. This indicates the tools are likely created by the same actor. As BlackGear has evolved to target Japan and continues developing new tools, it remains a persistent threat. The modular architecture allows flexible updates avoiding disruption. The report provides indicators of compromise for the various malware tools. In summary, the report provides an in-depth analysis of the evolving BlackGear campaign which uses stealthy techniques to maintain persistent access to targets and evade detection.
