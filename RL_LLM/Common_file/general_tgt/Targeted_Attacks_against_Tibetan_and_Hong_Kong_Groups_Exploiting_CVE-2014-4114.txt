The PDF analyzes targeted malware attacks leveraging CVE-2014-4114 against Tibetan diaspora groups and Hong Kong pro-democracy groups. The attacks delivered malicious Microsoft PowerPoint Slideshow (.pps) files via email that appeared to reuse legitimate content in decoy documents. Multiple waves of attacks were observed against Tibetan groups in April-May 2015. Email lures referenced Tibetan advocacy campaigns and the Dalai Lama. One attack distributed malware via Google Drive, potentially in response to a Tibetan anti-attachment campaign. Two attacks on Hong Kong groups in March 2015 spoofed a Hong Kong legislator and referenced Occupy Central protests. When the .pps slideshow is viewed, the CVE-2014-4114 exploit drops a .inf file and malicious .gif executable. The .inf file executes the malware. Payloads included PlugX RAT signed with stolen certificates and other remote access malware. Some payloads connected to command and control domains linked to prior attacks on Tibetans and Hong Kong groups. The use of CVE-2014-4114, legitimate decoy docs, and low antivirus detection indicate a sophisticated threat actor. The report concludes that the overlap of tactics, tools, and infrastructure warrants further research into whether it is one group attacking both communities or coordination between multiple groups.
