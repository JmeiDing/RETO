The security company PT ESC has been monitoring the financially-motivated hacking group Cobalt since 2016. Cobalt targets financial organizations worldwide, causing over $14 million in damages in one attack. Over the past year, Cobalt has modified its malware tools CobInt and COM-DLL-Dropper, which deliver the JavaScript backdoor more_eggs. The group has also adopted new techniques for distributing malware and bypassing security. In late 2019, Cobalt targeted European financial institutions using phishing sites impersonating the European Central Bank website. The phishing site prompted visitors to download malware droppers disguised as browser updates. Around the same time, Cobalt distributed malware using Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) files attached to emails. VHD files can contain hidden file systems undetectable by antivirus software. In early 2020, Cobalt used a new version of COM-DLL-Dropper containing advanced anti-analysis and obfuscation techniques. The dropper generates obfuscated JavaScript to deliver more_eggs. It also uses multiple persistence mechanisms like registry keys and scheduled tasks. Cobalt frequently updates its tactics, techniques, and procedures to evade detection. The group is highly motivated and likely has substantial resources to maintain infrastructure and develop new malware. As organizations adapt remote work policies during the COVID-19 pandemic, threat actors may increasingly target remote workers outside the corporate security perimeter. Continued monitoring of Cobalt's evolving tradecraft can help defend against future attacks.
