The document provides an analysis of the Carbanak cybercrime group that has targeted banks and financial institutions since late 2013. The group uses advanced persistent threat (APT) techniques for financial gain rather than espionage. The attacks typically start with spear phishing emails containing malicious attachments that exploit Microsoft Office vulnerabilities. Once executed, the malware (notably a remote access trojan called Carbanak) is installed on the victim's system. Once infected, Carbanak logs keystrokes and takes screenshots every 20 seconds using ResumeThread calls. The malware sets the Termservice service execution mode to Auto on infected systems to enable remote desktop connections. Carbanak sends HTTP requests with RC2+Base64 encryption and random extensions to communicate with its C2 server. Carbanak malware capabilities are outlined, including keylogging, screenshots, monitoring configurations, and modules for expanded functionality. It communicates via encrypted HTTP and is sometimes signed digitally for stealth. Rotating C2 servers are used for issuing commands and data exfiltration. The report concludes that the financially-motivated Carbanak group exhibits sophisticated techniques akin to nation-state APT actors. The group seems to be expanding operations geographically. Recommendations include improving security around internet-facing services, spear phishing defenses, and legacy system vulnerabilities.
