This G DATA blog post analyzes the Kraken malware that was used in a January 2015 spear phishing attack targeting an enterprise in the UAE. Kraken was advertised on underground markets as an information stealing and reconnaissance botnet malware priced around $300. The marketing promised advanced anti-analysis features. However, analysis by G DATA shows Kraken's capabilities are actually quite basic - hidden files can be easily revealed, anti-VM checks are basic, encryption is just RC4 and base64, and a Bitcoin wallet clipboard hijack feature is prone to false positives. The malware persistence uses simple registry run keys. The command and control panel seen has various mistakes and is not sophisticated. Much of the code is unpacked and analyzable. Kraken is likely first stage malware to identify valuable targets, with download and execute capabilities to deploy further malware. It was surprising to see such unsophisticated malware used in a targeted attack on high-level targets. This could point to attackers diversifying tactics, following up on infected machines they've found, or trying to intentionally distract/mislead researchers about the operation. Compared to advanced APT malware like Uroburos, Kraken does not demonstrate innovative techniques or stand out as being used by an advanced adversary. It shows attackers will still leverage basic vulnerabilities on outdated systems.
