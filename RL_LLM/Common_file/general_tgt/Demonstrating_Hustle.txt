The document describes campaigns by two Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, APT3 and APT18, taking advantage of the zero-day vulnerability CVE-2015-5119 in Adobe Flash. This vulnerability was leaked from the Hacking Team data breach before Adobe released a patch on July 8, 2015. Both APT groups quickly launched phishing campaigns exploiting the zero-day against organizations in various industries like aerospace, technology, telecommunications, etc. This demonstrates their ability to rapidly leverage new vulnerabilities before defenses are in place. APT3 sent emails with links to malicious JavaScript and Flash files that dropped a malware payload called SHOTPUT. This backdoor communicates with command and control servers hardcoded in the malware. APT18 likewise sent phishing emails with a link to download an exploit Flash file. This installed a remote access trojan called GH0ST RAT which connected to a known APT18 C2. The two groups took slightly different tactical approaches in exploiting the Flash zero-day. But both moved swiftly to take advantage of the vulnerability following the Hacking Team data leak, showing their adaptability, opportunism, and awareness of developments in the information security space. Recommendations include patching the vulnerability immediately, monitoring for related activity, blocking command and control systems, and preparing for incident response. The ability of APT groups to quickly leverage new exploits underscores the need for predictive defenses.
