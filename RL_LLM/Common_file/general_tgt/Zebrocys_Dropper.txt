The PDF analyzes recent malware documents used by the APT group Zebrocy to target organizations in Kazakhstan. Zebrocy is a subgroup of the Sofacy cyberespionage group. - Six Word documents purporting to be from a Kazakh company contained VBA macros that drop malware. Two were likely real spearphishing documents. - The VBA macros were password-protected, but could be reversed to find base64 encoded malware. This decoded to a Delphi executable called wininition. - Wininition contains keylogging functionality that logs keystrokes to be sent to a command and control server. The C2 URLs were obfuscated with hex encoding. - The researcher demonstrates how to decompile the malware using Interactive Delphi Reconstructor (IDR) and import the results into Ghidra using the dhrake plugin. This reconstructions Delphi symbol names and class structures. - Analysis revealed additional related Zebrocy activity, suggesting the group is actively targeting Central Asia. Indicators of compromise and YARA rules are provided to help detect this threat. - The report highlights techniques to analyze Zebrocy's malware documents, which use Evade macros and Delphi malware. Ongoing research is required to counter this adaptable subgroup as part of the formidable Sofacy APT.
