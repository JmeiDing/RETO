The report describes a cyberespionage group called Ferocious Kitten that has been actively targeting individuals in Iran since at least 2015. The group uses spearphishing emails containing malware to infect victims. Recently analyzed samples drop a remote access trojan called MarkiRAT to gather data. MarkiRAT initiates keylogging to capture keystrokes, including potential credentials. It also scrapes system memory and exfiltrates files of interest back to its command and control server. The malware can execute arbitrary commands received from the C2. Specific variants have been seen targeting the Telegram desktop app and Chrome browser to gain persistence. The group appears to be developing payloads for Android devices as well in order to target mobile users. Tactics like hijacking Telegram and Psiphon software show Ferocious Kitten is intent on targeting victims in Iran. Decoy content in the malware also utilizes political themes against the Iranian regime. The malware checks for Persian language settings on systems. While not the most advanced threat actor, Ferocious Kitten has managed to operate under the radar for over 6 years. Their continued development of Windows and Android malware indicates they are dedicated to expanding their surveillance capabilities within the country.
