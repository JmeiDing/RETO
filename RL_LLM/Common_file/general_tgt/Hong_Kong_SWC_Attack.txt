The PDF is a threat analysis report by Dragon Threat Labs detailing a strategic web compromise campaign targeting Hong Kong infrastructure. It examines a wateringhole attack on an educational institution's website that exploits a browser vulnerability to drop a multi-stage malware payload. The initial Swisyn dropper component detects the OS version to drop the appropriate decoder. The decoder component uses DLL hijacking to load the PCClient RAT which can exfiltrate data, execute commands, and move laterally. The RAT phones home to command servers and uses encoded beaconing. The report analyzes the malware components - their stealthy loading techniques, command structure, and evasion mechanisms. It maps out the attack infrastructure and associated artifacts. Detection and mitigation recommendations are provided through Yara rules, Snort signatures and IP blocklists to identify the malware and block the C2. In summary, the threat analysis provides an in-depth look at the attacker's tactics, techniques and procedures, the capabilities of the malware payload, and the associated infrastructure. It highlights the increasing wateringhole attacks against Hong Kong and the need for vigilance.
