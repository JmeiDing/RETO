The report analyzes a new Linux malware family called Kobalos that targets high-performance computing systems and servers in academia, enterprise, and government. Kobalos has complex obfuscation and implements backdoor capabilities like file system access, command execution, and proxying. It can also transform compromised hosts into C&C servers to manage bots. Kobalos leverages encrypted communication and authentication. It can be triggered passively by TCP connections from specific source ports or actively connect to C&C servers. Victims are located in Europe, North America, and Asia. Initial access may be from a separate SSH credential stealer also found on compromised hosts. Kobalos has been active since at least late 2019. The intentions of the threat actor are unclear as no additional malware was found. The sophistication indicates a knowledgeable attacker, not opportunistic hacking. Technical analysis examines the obfuscation, configuration, persistence mechanisms, network protocols, and supported commands. Yara rules, IOCs, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping are provided. In summary, the report uncovers an evasive, flexible Linux backdoor used to target servers and HPCs worldwide by a skilled threat actor or group.
