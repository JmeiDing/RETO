Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF document: The document analyzes a new destructive malware campaign called Operation Bleeding Bear targeting organizations in Ukraine. The multi-stage attack involves an initial MBR wiper payload to make systems inoperable, followed by a file infector to corrupt specific file types. The first stage MBR wiper overwrites the master boot record, displaying a ransom note on reboot though no decryption is offered. The second stage uses a Discord downloader to retrieve the main payload which tampers with Windows Defender through scripts and process hollowing. The final payload leverages process hollowing to load a file corrupter that overwrites, renames, and deletes targeted file types on local and networked drives. The goal appears to be destroying data rather than obtaining ransom. Elastic Security is able to prevent each stage of the attack using memory threat prevention, malware prevention, and ransomware prevention capabilities. Queries and detection rules are provided to identify the malicious behaviors. The campaign matches past destructive attacks like NotPetya that aim to destabilize and sow chaos rather than financial gain. The analysis provides insight into the adversary's techniques and how Elastic Security can mitigate similar threats.
