The report profiles the activities and evolution of the financially-motivated threat actor group TA505 from 2014-2020. Initially TA505 distributed banking trojans like Dridex and ransomware like Locky. Campaigns relied on the Necurs botnet for massive email distribution. Since 2018, TA505 has shifted to deploying remote access trojans and backdoors like FlawedAmmyy, ServHelper, and SDBbot. It compromises networks for monetary gain via ransomware, data theft, and reselling access. TA505 utilizes varied social engineering in weaponized documents to distribute first-stage droppers that fetch next-stage malware from command and control infrastructure. Compromise escalates through credential theft, reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. Anti-analysis techniques are employed including compression, signed binaries, unconventional Office macros, and mimicking legitimate software. Targeting is global with a focus on financial, retail, and now healthcare sectors. Links to other groups like Lazarus and Silence suggest TA505 conducts operations on behalf of clients. It is a persistent threat that continues to innovate techniques for financially-motivated intrusions against high-value targets.
