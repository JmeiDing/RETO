Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF: The report analyzes new malware tools named SeaDuke and CloudDuke used by the Duke advanced persistent threat (APT) group. SeaDuke is written in Python and is the first cross-platform malware created by Duke with support for both Windows and Linux. CloudDuke is a set of malware components referred to as "solutions" by Duke. CloudDuke relies heavily on Microsoft OneDrive for command and control as well as exfiltrating stolen data. It includes a loader, downloader, and two trojans - BastionSolution and OneDriveSolution. Spear-phishing campaigns distribute CloudDuke via emails with malicious links. The Duke group is directing resources towards evading detection by rewriting the same malware code in multiple languages (SeaDuke and BastionSolution) and increasingly using third-party cloud services like OneDrive for stealthy data theft. Duke has been running this espionage campaign for years against targets like government organizations. The latest tools indicate Duke is continuing operations using versatile malware like CloudDuke and SeaDuke designed to avoid detection. Defense recommendations include blocking suspicious file hosting sites, monitoring cloud storage usage, training users on phishing identification, keeping systems patched and security software up-to-date, and implementing comprehensive monitoring to detect intrusions.
