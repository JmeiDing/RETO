The security company Volexity has observed new activity from the threat actor Lazarus Group, believed to be associated with North Korea. The group is deploying a variant of the AppleJeus malware targeting cryptocurrency users and organizations via malicious Microsoft Office documents. Volexity discovered a fake cryptocurrency website set up by Lazarus Group that clones the legitimate site HaasOnline. The fake site distributes an MSI file that installs AppleJeus alongside a legitimate cryptocurrency trading app. The malware creates a scheduled task to execute a file that performs chained DLL side-loading to bypass defenses and fetch additional payloads. Analysis shows this is a new version of AppleJeus with heavy obfuscation. The malware collects system info to identify sandboxes, and downloads shellcode from a command and control server. Volexity also found malicious Office documents that use VBA macros to deploy AppleJeus payloads in a similar manner. The technical details of this campaign match previous versions of AppleJeus described in a CISA report. New elements include chained DLL side-loading, Office documents for distribution, and new network protocols. Lazarus Group continues targeting cryptocurrency users despite public reporting on their tactics. Volexity recommends enabling PowerShell logging, monitoring new scheduled tasks, blocking macros in Office, and using provided IOCs and YARA rules to detect this activity. Their products and services can also help defend against these threats.
