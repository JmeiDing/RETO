The document analyzes overlaps in tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) between Chinese and Indian advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. Specifically, it examines similarities in weaponized RTF phishing files used by several Chinese APTs (Goblin Panda, Temp.Periscope, Temp.Trident) and one Indian APT (Sidewinder). Analysis identified shared object dimensions and obfuscation methods in the RTF files of these groups, indicating use of a common phishing kit and potentially a shared supply chain. However, the groups diverge in post-exploitation stages. Sidewinder downloads payloads via HTAs while the Chinese APTs use shellcode and source files. This points to separate operators tailoring the tools after initial acquisition. The timeline shows the Chinese groups leveraging the phishing kit first, with Sidewinder adopting it months later. This raises the possibility of Chinese-Indian APT overlap in exploit trading, though the origin of the kit is undetermined. The report concludes that more research is needed on supply chain relationships between advanced threat groups in Asia. Defenders should monitor for shifts in TTPs that may indicate APTs acquiring new shared tools and exploits.
