The document provides an analysis of a China-linked cyberespionage threat group called BRONZE BUTLER that has been targeting Japanese organizations since at least 2012. The group uses phishing, strategic web compromises, and zero-day exploits to gain initial access to networks. BRONZE BUTLER has a variety of custom remote access tools and downloaders like Daserf, Datper, and xxmm that communicate with encrypted C2 servers. These tools have keylogging, screenshotting, and data exfiltration capabilities. The group frequently changes infrastructure and tools to evade detection. Once inside a network, BRONZE BUTLER enumerates hosts, escalates privileges, moves laterally, and exfiltrates large amounts of data related to intellectual property, technology, and business operations. The stolen data is often archived and password-protected. The group maintains persistent access to re-enter compromised networks when needed. The report provides strategic and tactical analysis of BRONZE BUTLER's intent, attribution, infrastructure, targeting, malware, tactics, and indicators of compromise. It aims to equip network defenders with insights to detect and respond to this advanced, stealthy threat group.
