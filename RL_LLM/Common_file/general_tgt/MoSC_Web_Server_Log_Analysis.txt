The PDF discusses techniques for detecting web shells and other malicious activity by analyzing web server logs. Web shells allow attackers to gain control of web servers and hide malware. Some key points: Good logging practices are important for detecting intrusions. Web servers tend to have better default logging than other servers. Logs should be aggregated and archived. Look for signs of SQL injection like large log files, SQL commands in logs, HTTP status codes indicating failed requests, and IIS logs showing "cmd.exe" or "xp_cmdshell". Check for directory enumeration attempts that try to identify web server software and available scripts. These show up as many requests for directories on the site. Use statistical analysis to find outliers in the logs. This can reveal unusual pages, requests that take longer to process, and other anomalies that could indicate malicious pages or web shells. Review other server logs like system and application logs for supporting evidence of attacks identified in web logs. Automate log analysis queries and reports to continually monitor for malicious activity. Focus on finding patterns of behavior that are not normal or expected for your environment. The key is using web server logs to hunt for signs of web shells, unauthorized access, and privilege escalation. Combined with monitoring of other server logs, this can help detect intruders hiding in plain sight on web servers.
