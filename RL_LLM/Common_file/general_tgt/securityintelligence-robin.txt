The Raspberry Robin worm has been rapidly spreading via USB devices and infecting devices globally. Observations by IBM Managed Detection and Response (MDR) find links between Raspberry Robin and the Russia-based cybercriminal group Evil Corp, which operates the Dridex malware. Raspberry Robin is typically delivered via a malicious .LNK file on a USB device. The msiexec commands used by the IBM Security MDR team evade detection, contain the victim's hostname and username, and connect over a non-standard HTTP port (8080). During infection, msiexec.exe also utilizes other legitimate Windows system utilities and tools known as LOLBin, such as rundll32.exe, fodhelper.exe, regsvr32.exe, dllhost.exe, and odbcconf.exe to load and execute the downloaded Raspberry Robin loader dynamic link libraries (DLLs). Analysis by IBM X-Force reveals Raspberry Robin loaders use encryption and obfuscation to decode an intermediate loader that detects hooks and launches the final payload. Comparative analysis between a Raspberry Robin loader DLL and a Dridex loader DLL shows strong similarities in structure and functionality. Both fix the PE header of decrypted components, use similar string decoding, and contain hook detection in their intermediate loaders. In July 2022, Microsoft disclosed that Raspberry Robin installs the FAKEUPDATES malware, which has been used by Evil Corp to deliver Dridex and ransomware since 2018. This further links Raspberry Robin to Evil Corp infrastructure. Evil Corp is known for Dridex malware and ransomware families like Dopplepaymer. They rebranded to ransomware-as-a-service to skirt US Treasury sanctions imposed in 2019. Defending against Raspberry Robin requires security awareness training, monitoring for IOCs, disabling USB autorun, and leveraging EDR solutions. The initial access remains social engineering to get victims to plug in USB devices.
