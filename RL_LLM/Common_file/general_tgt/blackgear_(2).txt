The document analyzes the BlackGear espionage campaign which has been targeting Taiwan users for years using the ELIRKS backdoor. Researchers found BlackGear now also targets Japanese users based on Japanese language documents and use of Japan-based blogs/microblogs for command and control. BlackGear uses a three stage attack process - binder malware delivered via phishing/watering holes, downloader malware that retrieves backdoors from attacker sites, and backdoor malware that provides persistent access. The backdoors retrieve encrypted C2 instructions from blogs/microblogs to mask C2 traffic as normal blog traffic. They use hardcoded tags in blog posts to locate the encrypted data. The backdoors can exfiltrate data, take screenshots, download files, and open remote shells. Analysis revealed connections between the families like shared log filenames, encryption keys, etc. indicating they are created by the same actor. BlackGear continues evolving with new targets/tools and remains a persistent threat. In summary, the analysis examines the evolving BlackGear campaign, its stealthy C2 techniques, modular tools, and targets. It highlights the persistent threat of this espionage campaign.
