The PDF provides an analysis of a cyberespionage campaign called Operation Sphinx targeting political and military organizations in Egypt, Israel, and other countries in the Middle East. The main approach is watering hole attacks on social media sites like Facebook. The attackers compromise accounts related to the Israeli military and government and post malicious links in comments. The links download RAR files containing weaponized documents impersonating PDFs or Office files. When clicked, the documents drop malware modules that steal sensitive data and exfiltrate it to command and control servers. The main malware is called ROCK and has multiple components for keylogging, screen capture, Skype monitoring, etc. The modules are injected into different processes for stealth. Strings are encrypted and API calls obscured to evade detection. Lure documents suggest targeting of Egypt and Israel. Links between samples reveal associations with Egypt. The malware appears professionally developed, likely with help of third parties. The campaign was most active between mid-2014 and late 2015. The report aims to expose the tactics, techniques, and procedures used in this Middle East cyberespionage operation. It shows how social engineering is combined with advanced malware to target high-profile victims and steal sensitive data.
