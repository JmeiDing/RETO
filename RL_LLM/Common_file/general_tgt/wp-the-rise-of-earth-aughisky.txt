The document provides an in-depth analysis of the cyberespionage group Earth Aughisky, also known as Taidoor. Earth Aughisky has been active for over a decade, continuously updating its malware and tactics. The group primarily targets government and enterprises in Taiwan, but expanded to Japan in 2017-2018. It uses varied malware like Roudan, Taleret, Serkdes, and Kuangdao for initial intrusion and long-term access. The report provides technical analysis of each malware family. Potential connections are drawn between Earth Aughisky and other Chinese-speaking threat actors based on code similarities, certificates, infrastructure links, and shared malware. Timelines track notable changes like simplified Roudan versions and decreased activity after 2017. The report speculates that real-world organizational shifts could explain the technical and targeting changes observed recently. It concludes that Earth Aughisky remains a sophisticated, enduring threat that constantly reinvents its arsenal. The threat intelligence aims to help potential targets detect intrusions and defend against the group's tactics. Continued tracking of Earth Aughisky can reveal insights into its structure, capabilities, and associations with other advanced persistent threat groups.
