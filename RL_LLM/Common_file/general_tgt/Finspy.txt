Amnesty International's Security Lab investigated recently discovered samples of FinSpy, a commercial spyware produced by German company FinFisher. In Egypt, the attackers NilePhish distributed FinSpy using fake Adobe Flash updates. Analysis revealed new versions of FinSpy for Windows, Android, MacOS, and Linux operating systems. The MacOS and Linux versions have extensive surveillance capabilities through a modular framework. Modules enable keylogging, microphone recording, camera access, email and messaging collection. Configuration details show targeting of social media, VoIP, and circumvention software. The Android sample exfiltrates data through SMS and has new obfuscation techniques. A backdoored WinRAR executable was also found distributing FinSpy. Across samples, timestamps indicate most recent development and packaging between April 2019 to September 2019. Amnesty International notes concerning use of FinSpy to target activists and dissidents, instead of lawful criminal investigations. The report aims to aid cybersecurity research into newly uncovered FinSpy variants, raise awareness of evolving threats to human rights defenders, and highlight the proliferation of commercial spyware by companies like FinFisher.
