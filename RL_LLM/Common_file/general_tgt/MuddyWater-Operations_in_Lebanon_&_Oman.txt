The PDF describes a campaign by the Iranian threat actor group MuddyWater targeting victims in Lebanon and Oman. MuddyWater conducted a two-stage spear phishing attack, using macro-enabled Word documents as the initial vector. The first stage documents posed as fake resumes or letters from the Ministry of Justice. When opened, they executed a malicious macro that launched an Excel process and PowerShell command. This downloaded a second stage PowerShell script from compromised domains, including one owned by an Israeli web developer. The second stage script contained obfuscated JavaScript, VBScript, and PowerShell code. It executes using Windows Script Host to ultimately deobfuscate and deploy MuddyWater's PowerShell backdoor POWERSTATS. This backdoor uses various techniques for persistence, obfuscation, and UAC bypass. The PDF provides technical analysis of the deobfuscation steps and code. It also includes indicators of compromise like document hashes, delivery URLs, and proxy lists. The authors conclude that MuddyWater is evolving its tactics, moving from single stage to more advanced two-stage attacks. They are also adopting new evasion techniques like multilayered obfuscation. However the group continues to rely on POWERSTATS as their main backdoor. The PDF aims to provide insights to help the security community detect and defend against this threat actor.
