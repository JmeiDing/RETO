The report describes a watering hole attack campaign attributed to the Turla cyberespionage group. The key findings are: - Turla compromised several Armenian government and military websites to deliver malware to visitors. - JavaScript code fingerprints visitors and only specific targets are redirected to fake Adobe Flash updates that drop malware. - Initially the Skipper backdoor was delivered, but later switched to a .NET downloader called NetFlash and a Python backdoor named PyFlash. - NetFlash sets persistence via scheduled tasks and retrieves PyFlash from a command server. - PyFlash exfiltrates system info and can execute commands downloaded from its command server, encrypted via AES. - The social engineering and malware delivery tactics bear similarities to previous Turla watering hole campaigns over the past years. - The report provides indicators of compromise like malicious scripts, domains, and samples related to this activity attributed to Turla. In summary, the report analyzes an ongoing watering hole operation by Turla that infects select visitors to compromised Armenian websites with two sophisticated backdoors for espionage.
