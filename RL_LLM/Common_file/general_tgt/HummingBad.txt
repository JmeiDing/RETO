The report provides an in-depth analysis of HummingBad, a sophisticated malware campaign targeting Android devices. Researchers attribute the campaign to Yingmob, a Chinese mobile ad network company. Yingmob runs the malware operation alongside its legitimate ad business, sharing infrastructure and resources. This allows the malware campaign to infect over 85 million devices and generate $300,000 per month in fraudulent ad revenue. The malware uses rooting exploits and social engineering to gain system-level access on devices. It then installs fraudulent apps to create fake clicks and impressions. Yingmob tracks and manages the malware using a command and control platform. With control of over 85 million devices, Yingmob could potentially sell access to the highest bidder. The data and capabilities of compromised devices could be very valuable to cybercriminals. The report concludes by warning that as attackers become more independent and sophisticated like Yingmob, larger and more dangerous mobile malware campaigns will emerge. The findings highlight the increasing threat that mobile malware poses to both consumers and enterprises.
