The PDF discusses research by FortiGuard Labs into a recent malware campaign conducted by a threat actor group called Gamaredon Group, which has been active since 2013 targeting Ukrainian government and military organizations. The analysis focuses on the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by Gamaredon Group, based on examination of a recent malware sample. The initial infection vector is via spear-phishing emails containing weaponized Office documents. When opened, the documents execute malicious macros to launch PowerShell commands that provide command line access and enable communications with attacker servers. The malware utilizes multiple stages, including batch scripts, shortcuts, and self-extracting archives containing additional payloads. Data is collected from the infected host and exfiltrated to the attacker's server, which then deploys the main remote access trojan. Forensic analysis of artifacts in the malware samples provides insights into the group's tools and methods. For example, compiled timestamps reveal the software used to build the malware, and Russian language strings provide clues about the malware authors. While attribution is not definitive, the targeting, language indicators, and operational security lapses point to Gamaredon Group having ties to Russian state-sponsored actors rather than cybercriminals. The report summarizes the group's tactics and highlights opportunities for further tracking the threat actors through additional malware analysis.
