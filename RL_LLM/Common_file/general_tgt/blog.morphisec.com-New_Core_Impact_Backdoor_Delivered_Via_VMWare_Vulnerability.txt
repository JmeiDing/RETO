The post discusses recent exploitation attempts targeting a new remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in VMware Workspace ONE Access, an identity and access management platform. The attacks occurred only a week after the vulnerability was disclosed. Based on indicators of sophisticated backdoors, Morphisec believes advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are behind the events. The tactics match those of threats like the Iran-linked Rocket Kitten. The RCE vulnerability stems from a server-side template injection issue in an Apache Tomcat component. It allows attackers with network access to achieve full remote code execution against VMware's identity management. Morphisec observed attackers exploiting this to deploy reverse HTTPS backdoors like Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, and Core Impact. These can enable further malicious activity like ransomware or coin mining while bypassing defenses. Analysis shows a multi-stage attack chain starting with the RCE exploit, leading to a PowerShell stager, the PowerTrash loader, and finally the Core Impact backdoor. The loader reflects the final payload into memory without touching disk. Indicators point to a likely bad actor behind the hosting infrastructure, and similarities to previous campaigns targeting VMware. The speed of these updated attacks highlights the need for runtime protection against zero-day and fileless threats.
