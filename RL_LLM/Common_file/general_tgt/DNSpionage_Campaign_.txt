Here is a summary of the key points from the DNSpionage campaign analysis PDF: DNSpionage is a new malware campaign uncovered by Cisco Talos targeting organizations in Lebanon and the UAE. Attackers used fake job recruitment websites to distribute malicious Microsoft Office documents containing macros. When opened, the macros install a remote access trojan dubbed DNSpionage. DNSpionage supports HTTP and DNS communication channels to receive commands and exfiltrate data from compromised systems. It logs keystrokes and command output to track user activity. The malware retrieves configurations from the command server that specify custom encoding alphabets to obfuscate traffic. Cisco Talos discovered the attackers also redirected DNS records for government and private company domains in Lebanon and UAE to an IP address under their control. Let's Encrypt SSL certificates were generated for the redirected domains to avoid detection. The full impact of the DNS hijacking is unknown. Analysis of the DNSpionage malware reveals it was crafted to stay under the radar, tailoring infections to victims' environments. String obfuscation, multistage deployment, and operating only when Microsoft Office is closed help it avoid sandbox detection. Researchers connected the malware campaign to the DNS hijacking through shared threat infrastructure. The advanced capabilities of DNSpionage and its targeting of high-value Middle East organizations suggest a sophisticated attacker. Protection methods include blocking malicious domains, detecting credential phishing attempts, monitoring DNS traffic, and restricting Office macros.
