This document summarizes research by RSA on a remote access trojan called GlassRAT. GlassRAT is a stealthy malware that has evaded detection by most antivirus products for years. It was first observed in the wild in 2012 but only recently analyzed. The malware uses a code signing certificate that appears stolen from a major Chinese software developer to sign its dropper component. Telemetry and anecdotal evidence indicates GlassRAT has targeted Chinese nationals, including some associated with multinational companies. Infrastructure analysis found historical overlap between GlassRAT and other China-linked malware like Mirage, MagicFire, and PlugX that targeted Asia-Pacific organizations. GlassRAT has typical RAT capabilities like reverse shell, file transfer, and command execution. It uses a simple XOR obfuscation for its C2 configuration. RSA products like Security Analytics and ECAT can detect GlassRAT's behaviors and connections even though it is not flagged by antivirus scans. The report provides technical details on GlassRAT's infection process, capabilities, infrastructure, and detection methods. It demonstrates sophisticated evasion tactics by a potentially experienced threat actor. In summary, GlassRAT is a stealthy and long-running RAT likely focused on targeting Chinese victims that exhibits connections to other Chinese campaigns. The research highlights the importance of behavior-based threat detection.
