The report details a series of cyberattacks dubbed "Operation Pawn Storm" conducted by threat actors targeting military, government, and defense contractor personnel. The main tactics used were spear-phishing emails containing malware and sophisticated phishing websites mimicking conferences and media outlets. The attacks used malware from the SEDNIT/Sofacy family, which includes information stealers and backdoors that can log keystrokes, steal system info, and exfiltrate data. The malware was delivered in multiple stages to evade detection, with the initial downloader dropping further malware. The attacks started as early as October 2011, with spear-phishing emails using exploits or conference invitations as lures. High-profile targets included the Ministry of Defense in Hungary and France, OSCE in Austria, defense contractor SAIC and Academi in the US. The attackers also created phishing websites mimicking the email login pages of targets' email providers and webmail services. Victims would be redirected to these fake login pages through malicious links, capturing their credentials. Affected webmail providers included Outlook Web Access, Gmail, Yahoo, and others. Overall, the attacks demonstrate the use of custom, targeted malware and sophisticated social engineering tactics to compromise high-value individuals and organizations, evading detection. The report provides an in-depth look at the tools, techniques, and procedures of the threat actors behind Operation Pawn Storm.
