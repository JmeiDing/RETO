The cybersecurity company Cyble recently discovered two Android spyware strains called Hornbill and SunBird that appear to be connected to an advanced persistent threat (APT) hacking group known as Confucius. Confucius has been active since 2013 targeting organizations in Pakistan and other parts of South Asia. The group has previously created Windows malware but recently expanded into mobile malware with the ChatSpy app in 2017. Hornbill and SunBird are embedded in fake Android apps that are used to monitor and steal data from mobile devices. The apps were used to target individuals in Pakistan's military, nuclear authorities, and Kashmiri election officials. The fake apps have advanced capabilities like taking photos, recording location, scraping WhatsApp data, and requesting elevated device privileges. The data is collected in databases, compressed, and sent to the hackers' command and control servers. SunBird has additional capabilities compared to Hornbill, including more extensive data extraction, downloading attacker-specified files, and running arbitrary commands with root privileges if possible. The malware is distributed through social engineering tactics to get targets to install the fake apps from direct links rather than official app stores. Analysis of exfiltrated data from insecurely configured SunBird servers revealed potential targets included Pakistan Air Force, Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, and other government departments. The stolen data included SMS messages, contacts, call logs, installed apps, browser history, calendar info, and WhatsApp data. Similar to fake Android applications, the Confucius APT group also targets Windows systems. They use a word document delivered to the target to start the attack chain. Confucius also targets Windows systems through document-based malware utilizing template injection and compromise tactics similar to the fake Android apps. Cyble has provided indicators of compromise and recommendations like updating antivirus software, blocking suspicious URLs/IPs, avoiding unauthorized app stores, and being cautious with emails and attachments.
