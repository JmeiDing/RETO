Bisonal malware has been in use since at least 2014 and has three primary differences compared to older variants, including a different cipher and encryption for C2 communication, a large rewrite of the code for both network communication and maintaining persistence. The adversary behind these attacks lured the targets into launching Microsoft Windows executable malware by masquerading it as a PDF file (using a fake PDF icon) and reusing publicly available data for the decoy PDF fileâ€™s contents. Analysis shows the malware gathers system information, executes commands, and exfiltrates data to attacker-controlled servers. The group behind Bisonal appears to focus on government, military, and defense industry targets in Asia, reusing some infrastructure and coding artifacts for years. The targeting of a certificate authority could enable signing of malware to avoid detection. Observed tactics include registering attacker domains with dynamic DNS providers, using target-specific codes to track infections, and masquerading malware as documents. The disclosure aims to help potential targets bolster defenses and monitor for indicators of compromise associated with the Bisonal malware attacks.
