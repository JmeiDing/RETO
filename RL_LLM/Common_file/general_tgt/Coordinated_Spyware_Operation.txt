The document details a coordinated spyware campaign in India that targeted at least nine human rights defenders (HRDs) between January and October 2019. The targets were sent spearphishing emails containing malicious links that would install a commercially available spyware called NetWire if opened. Eight of the nine targeted HRDs were calling for the release of 11 activists arrested in 2018 for protests related to the Bhima Koregaon violence. The 11 activists have been imprisoned under India's anti-terror law, the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The HRDs targeted have been involved in litigation, research and activism to demand their release. Surveillance of HRDs solely for their human rights work is considered an unlawful attack on their right to privacy and freedom of expression. The report says this spyware campaign underscores the need for the Indian government to investigate these attacks and ensure surveillance of HRDs meets international human rights standards. Three of the nine HRDs were also targeted in 2019 by Pegasus spyware created by Israeli cyberarms company NSO Group. This shows a pattern of digital attacks on those supporting the release of the Bhima Koregaon activists. The report provides technical details on how the spearphishing emails attempted to deliver NetWire spyware using obfuscation techniques and valid digital signatures. It traces the infrastructure used in the attacks to NetWire command and control servers. The report calls on the Indian government to investigate these attacks, ensure surveillance meets legal standards, and provide remedies for rights violations linked to unlawful surveillance. It asks the government to reform laws enabling surveillance without judicial oversight.
