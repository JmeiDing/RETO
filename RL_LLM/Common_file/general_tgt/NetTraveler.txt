The PDF describes analysis by Palo Alto Networks of a spear phishing campaign targeting a diplomat from the Embassy of Uzbekistan in China. The email contains a malicious Word document that exploits CVE-2012-0158 to install a malware called NetTraveler, which is a remote access trojan used in cyber espionage campaigns for over a decade. The document drops a DLL which loads encrypted configuration settings and an embedded NetTraveler payload. NetTraveler establishes persistence by hijacking a Windows service to load its DLL. NetTraveler contacts a command and control server at voennovosti[.]com which can send commands to collect data, download files, and uninstall itself. The C2 address is decrypted from another module. The target, decoy document theme, and continued reliance on the NetTraveler malware suggests the threat actor behind this is a nation-state engaged in cyber espionage campaigns. The analysis includes indicators of compromise and a breakdown of the infection process. It highlights that cyber espionage groups continue to rely on proven malware like NetTraveler and spear phishing tactics.
