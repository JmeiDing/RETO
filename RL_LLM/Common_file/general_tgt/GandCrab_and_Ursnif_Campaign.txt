The PDF analyzes a campaign distributing both Ursnif malware and GandCrab ransomware via malicious Word documents. The campaign started in December 2018, using Word docs with embedded macros that execute a PowerShell script when opened. Over 180 variants were observed. The PowerShell script contains two main functions - one using DownloadString to retrieve a GandCrab loader script, and one using DownloadData to retrieve a Ursnif executable. The GandCrab loader injects a GandCrab ransomware executable into the PowerShell process for execution. The Ursnif exe performs credential theft and deploying other malware. Metadata analysis shows the Word docs were continuously updated between December and January, with random metadata fields likely to avoid detection. Approximately 120 Ursnif variants were hosted for download during the campaign, primarily grouped by command and control infrastructure similarities. The campaign demonstrates the effectiveness of macro Word docs to distribute malware like info-stealers and ransomware to compromise systems. All the major components of the attack chain are analyzed. IOCs, Yara rules, and VT Graph analysis are provided to aid detection and linking of related samples.
