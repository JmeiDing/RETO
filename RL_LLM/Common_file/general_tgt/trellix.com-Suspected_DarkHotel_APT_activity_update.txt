The Trellix threat research team discovered a campaign targeting luxury hotels in Macao, China starting in November 2021. Emails sent to hotel management contained a malicious Excel attachment that enabled macros to execute scripts and exfiltrate data. The infrastructure and targeting align with previous activity associated with the DarkHotel APT group known for compromising hotel networks to spy on high-value guests. The macro code shares similarities with past DarkHotel campaigns. The macros create scheduled tasks, use Windows utilities for execution, and send data to a command and control server at fsm-gov.com impersonating a legitimate Micronesian government domain. A second stage Excel variant was also uncovered. The campaign's objectives appear to be laying groundwork for future data theft from compromised hotels. Many conferences were canceled due to COVID-19, which may have limited infections. The Macao Security Force Bureau issued a public alert about the fsm-gov.com domain in December 2021. While not definitively attributed, the targeting, infrastructure, and TTPs align with DarkHotel's interest in the hotel industry for cyber espionage. Trellix has moderate confidence of APT activity but notes the IP was associated with unrelated criminal use. The report provides indicators of compromise, MITRE ATT&CK techniques, and detection guidance for security teams. It highlights the risk of cyber espionage for hotel guests and the need for travelers to practice security precautions.
