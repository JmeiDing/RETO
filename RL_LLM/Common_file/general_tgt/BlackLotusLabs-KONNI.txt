This PDF documents a cyber espionage campaign targeting the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MID) that uses the Konni malware. Here is a summary: The campaign began in October 2021 with phishing links impersonating MID portals to harvest credentials. In November, the threat actor sent COVID-19 themed lures with files impersonating Russian vaccine registration software that installed malware. In December, the actor compromised an MID email account and sent malicious emails with a trojanized screensaver to MID personnel. Analysis found connections between the phases - same IP, similar TTPs, nearly identical malware. The screensaver downloaded a light-weight loader that retrieved additional payloads from command and control servers. The malware gathered system info and running tasks from infected machines. Based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures, the malware has been attributed to the Konni malware linked to North Korean state-sponsored cyber espionage operations. The campaign demonstrates the persistence of advanced threat actors in targeting high-value organizations through multiple stages to establish network access and enable cyber espionage. Defensive measures like monitoring, multi-factor authentication, and employee education can help protect against such threats.
