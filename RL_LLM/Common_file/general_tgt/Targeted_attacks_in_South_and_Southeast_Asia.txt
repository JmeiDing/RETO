The PDF analyzes targeted cyberattacks by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group that Microsoft calls PLATINUM against organizations in South and Southeast Asia since at least 2009. PLATINUM conducts carefully planned campaigns against government-related entities using spear phishing, zero-day exploits, custom backdoors, credential theft tools, and other sophisticated tactics. The report profiles PLATINUM's methods which include using multiple backdoors like Dipsind, JPIN, and others showing considerable malware development resources. They have leveraged several zero-day exploits in attacks indicating ability to acquire or research them. Victim targeting concentrates on a specific region rather than being opportunistic. Tools like a custom keylogger and hot patcher injector exhibit organization. Technical details are provided on PLATINUM's backdoors, keyloggers, hot patching technique, and an Office exploit. Infrastructure analysis reveals domains, IPs, dynamic DNS, and compromised academic institutions used for command and control. Recommendations include applying security updates, enabling Windows mitigations, training staff, firewall/proxy filtering, and being forensically ready to detect PLATINUM intrusions. The report aims to raise awareness so organizations can thwart similar advanced targeted attacks.
