The blog post describes the analysis of a malicious Excel document that contained an obfuscated VBA macro. The macro built a PowerShell command that downloaded a file from the Notepad++ website. Further analysis showed the macro was modified by a researcher, and normally downloaded payloads from other domains. Pivoting in AutoFocus revealed 171 recent samples using similar PowerShell commands, leading to a set of hashes for downloaded files. Most were compiled in the past few months and contained PDB paths, suggesting the malware authors were incorporating their code into compiled projects. The downloaded files exhibited behavior associated with the Chthonic banking Trojan, a variant of Zeus. When executed, they would launch a legitimate process like msiexec.exe and inject code to download additional payloads from command and control servers. Investigating the command and control domains revealed links to Nymaim malware. Nymaim uses a domain generation algorithm seeded with static domains hosted on the identified infrastructure. Many of the domains followed patterns suggesting they were part of the Nymaim DGA. Expanding the investigation uncovered 707 IP addresses and over 2600 domains used for various malicious purposes like phishing, carding forums, distributing other malware strains, and more. The infrastructure seems to be a collection of compromised websites and accounts used by multiple criminal groups. The analysis demonstrates how pivoting from one sample can uncover extensive infrastructure re-used across different malware families and cybercriminal operations. The author includes IOCs and Yara rules for defenders to detect this activity.
