The report by Trend Micro analyzes the behaviors and artifacts of three persistent adware variants - DealPly, IsErIk, and ManageX. It finds that these modular threats are often bundled together in legitimate-looking software installers. Once installed, they use complex techniques like scheduled tasks, binary fragmentation, and reflective loading to persist and communicate with command servers. The adware extracts system data like browser cookies and exfiltrates it encrypted. Though not overtly malicious, it provides a foothold that could be used to deliver further payloads. The threats are widespread globally, with high volume in the US, Japan, and Taiwan. By correlating execution chains and network infrastructure, researchers assess DealPly, IsErIk, and ManageX are likely related or cooperating. Overlaps suggest shared developer resources. The report aims to expose the sophisticated methods adware uses to hide, which can impact organizations. In summary, it provides an in-depth analysis into the covert behaviors of modular adware families that often fly under the radar. The research highlights the need for security tools that provide visibility into the full attack chain and lifecycle to defend against persistent and evolving threats.
