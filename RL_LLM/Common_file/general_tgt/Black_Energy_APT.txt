The document analyzes attacks by a threat actor group called BlackEnergy APT against Ukraine. BlackEnergy emerged in 2007 as a DDoS malware and was later modified to target industrial control systems and energy companies. In 2014, a BlackEnergy subgroup started using new SCADA plugins to hit ICS and energy victims worldwide. Recently, BlackEnergy has frequently used Excel docs with macros to drop malware in Ukraine. The analyzed Word document contains macros that drop a BlackEnergy trojan payload when enabled. The trojan connects to a command and control server used in previous attacks on Ukrainian media organizations. The BlackEnergy malware sends victim system info to the C2 and can receive commands. The attacks likely aim to compromise industrial controls and espionage, but BlackEnergy payloads also include disk wiping capabilities. Advice is provided on the sectors being targeted and detections for the malware. The attackers' continued reliance on macros in Office documents highlights the need for ongoing user education and advanced defenses.
