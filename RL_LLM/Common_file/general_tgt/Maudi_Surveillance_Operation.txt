The PDF provides an analysis of the Maudi malware family, which is used to install the PoisonIvy remote access trojan. Maudi droppers typically create a malicious library and PoisonIvy shellcode blob on infected systems. The library hijacks Explorer to load and execute the PoisonIvy code, connecting to a command and control server. Maudi samples share configuration similarities like encoded PoisonIvy profile IDs, passwords, and command domains. Most samples are signed with free self-signed certificates containing recognizable strings like "CeleWare". The malware appears focused on Chinese domestic targets and human rights activists based on decoy documents referencing Tibet and Uighurs. There are also indications of targeting Mongolia, with domains like "mol-government.com". The report maps out the infrastructure connections between samples through common command domains, registrant emails, and signing certificates. There is overlap with infrastructure used in other targeted attack campaigns like Mirage, Briba, and the RSA breach. While Maudi is not advanced malware, the infrastructure analysis provides insight into the ecosystem of Chinese threat actors and potential sharing between groups. The malware can be seen as part of the supply chain for more sophisticated threat campaigns.
