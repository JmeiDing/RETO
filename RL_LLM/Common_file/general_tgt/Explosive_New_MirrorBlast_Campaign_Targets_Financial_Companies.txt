The report by Morphisec Labs analyzes a new phishing campaign dubbed MirrorBlast that is targeting financial organizations. The attack starts with emails containing malicious links that download a weaponized Excel document. The Excel document contains a lightweight macro with anti-sandboxing checks. When enabled, it uses Windows Installer to download an MSI package which deploys either a KiXtart or Rebol script malware. This makes network requests to exfiltrate system data and can download additional payloads. Morphisec assesses with medium to high confidence that MirrorBlast is the work of TA505 based on TTP similarities with things like GetandGo loader, OneDrive lures, and the next-stage FlawedGrace RAT payload. The campaign infrastructure is expanding rapidly as well. The report includes extensive IOCs spanning email attachments, C2 domains/IPs, registry keys, file hashes, and YARA rules. It also provides analysis of the macro, script obfuscation techniques, and C2 communication. In summary, MirrorBlast illustrates the ongoing innovation of advanced cybercriminal groups like TA505. The financial sector remains an attractive target and defenders must adapt to new types of attacks that bypass traditional security controls.
