The PDF describes an incident where CrowdStrike's Falcon OverWatch threat hunting team detected and disrupted an intrusion attempt by a threat actor group called AQUATIC PANDA. This occurred at a large academic institution that was vulnerable due to the Log4Shell vulnerability in Log4j. OverWatch was hunting for unusual activity associated with VMware Horizon servers, which were flagged as vulnerable. They noticed suspicious DNS lookups to identify vulnerable servers from a Tomcat process on the institution's Horizon server. OverWatch then saw attempts to run Linux commands and download files, and retrieve threat actor tooling hosted on remote infrastructure using curl and wget commands, indicating exploitation attempts. They quickly alerted the institution's security team, providing context to initiate incident response. Analysis showed AQUATIC PANDA likely used a modified Log4Shell exploit found in their possession. The group continued reconnaissance and attempted to dump credentials. OverWatch tracked the threat actor's activities closely, enabling the institution to patch the vulnerability and prevent further access. This demonstrates OverWatch's ability to detect and disrupt intrusions based on adversary behavior, regardless of the specific vulnerability exploited. The PDF provides technical details on the commands and tools observed, YARA rules for detection, and background on AQUATIC PANDA's operations and targeting. It highlights the value of continuous threat hunting in times of uncertainty when new vulnerabilities emerge.
