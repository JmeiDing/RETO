The document analyzes targeted malware attacks against an NGO working on environmental issues in Southeast Asia. The phishing emails used topics related to economic development and politics in Burma relevant to the NGO's work. The attacks are connected to recent compromises of Burmese government websites and past attacks on Tibetan groups. The first attack email had a Google Drive link to PlugX malware signed with a stolen certificate. It connected to domains linked to previous attacks. The second attack email had a Google Drive link to a self-extracting RAR archive dropping a 9002 malware variant signed with a recent cert. The 9002 variant connected to a U.S. VPS IP registered to a Chinese company. Similarities exist in tactics, infrastructure, malware, and certificates linking these attacks to ones on Burmese government and Tibetan groups. The attacks may be by the same group or multiple groups sharing resources and infrastructure. Civil society groups lack enterprise security resources compared to government and industry targets.
