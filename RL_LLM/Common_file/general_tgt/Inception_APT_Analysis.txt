The document analyzes the malware Inception APT which spreads via a malicious RTF file. The RTF file exploits CVE-2012-0158 and contains embedded shellcode that uses egghunting to find the RTF file in memory. It then locates a second stage shellcode which is obfuscated. This deobfuscates itself and extracts an embedded VBS file, decrypting it in two iterations. The VBS file drops and decrypts a DLL file named wmiprvse.dll. This DLL file uses multiple layers of unpacking over several minutes. It avoids analysis by building its own import table at runtime. Ultimately it connects to a WebDAV C&C server to exfiltrate system and user data with hardcoded credentials. In summary, this is a thorough analysis of the Inception APT malware. It spreads via an exploit RTF, drops multiple stages of shellcode, unpacks itself dynamically, and stealthily exfiltrates data through a C&C server. The analysis does a good job walking through the infection process and major capabilities of the malware.
