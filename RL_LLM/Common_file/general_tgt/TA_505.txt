The report describes campaigns by the financially-motivated threat actor group TA505, as well as the broader use of the legitimate Remote Manipulator System (RMS) remote administration tool by multiple threat actors. TA505 has conducted high-volume malware campaigns since 2014 distributing banking trojans and ransomware. Recent campaigns leverage phishing emails with weaponized Office docs to deliver the ServHelper backdoor and RMS tool. Attacks targeted US retailers, Ukraine institutions, and financial organizations in Chile, India, Italy, Malawi, Pakistan and South Korea. RMS is promoted as a remote management tool but abused by threat actors. Underground forums detail how to silently install and configure it for malicious purposes. TA505 delivers RMS alongside other malware for persistence and lateral movement. Other actors deploy RMS against disparate targets indicating accessibility enables less sophisticated groups to mimic TA505 operations. Common tactics include social engineering lures impersonating businesses to entice opening attachments, VBA macros or exploits to run downloaders, fetching payloads from command and control servers, and quiet installation of RMS configured to beacon home. Goals are data exfiltration, financial theft, and remote access. Detection opportunities include RMS registry keys, unexpected connections to metadata services, and network traffic with the RMS user agent string. Protections should include updated antivirus, monitoring for suspicious behaviors, and user security awareness to recognize social engineering.
