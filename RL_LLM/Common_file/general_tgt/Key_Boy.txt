This report describes the analysis of a custom malware called KeyBoy that was used in targeted attacks against victims in Vietnam and India in 2013. The malware was distributed via weaponized Microsoft Word documents exploiting vulnerabilities. Once executed, KeyBoy installs itself as a malicious service and has capabilities to steal browser credentials, keylog, and allow interactive remote access. The remote access allows attackers to perform additional reconnaissance and exfiltrate data from compromised systems. The report provides technical details on KeyBoy's code and communication protocol, which uses encryption. It also covers detection methods like Snort rules and Yara signatures to identify infections. While targeted, the attacks do not appear highly sophisticated. The report concludes that organizations should focus on protecting their critical assets from impactful threats.
