The cybercriminal group ITG23, which operates malware like Trickbot and BazarLoader, has developed at least 13 different crypters to encrypt and obfuscate malware payloads. These crypters have names like Dave, Pear, Lore, Mirror, and Hexa. ITG23 uses the crypters to protect its own malware like Trickbot, BazarLoader, and Conti ransomware. But it also provides crypting services to other threat actor groups. ITG23 has long-standing relationships with the groups behind Emotet and IcedID banking trojans, and uses its crypters on their malware. In mid-2021, ITG23 set up an automated "Build Machine" using the Jenkins platform to scale up their crypting operations. The Build Machine can compile customized stub executables to embed encrypted payloads from various malware families. Analysis of ITG23's crypters reveals the use of obfuscation, polymorphism, anti-debugging, and other techniques to evade security products and analysis. Payloads are encrypted in ways that reduce detectable entropy. Most crypters execute the final payload in-memory after decryption. Leaked ITG23 chat logs provide further insight into their partnerships with groups like Emotet and IcedID. ITG23 also began providing crypting services to the Qakbot banking trojan in late 2021. Links between IcedID and the MountLocker ransomware operation suggest IcedID may be behind MountLocker. Defending against ITG23 requires updated threat intelligence on their latest crypters, malware, and attack tactics. Controls around email, endpoints, access, network segmentation, monitoring, and data protection are necessary to mitigate the risk.
