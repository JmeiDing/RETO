The post discusses the cyberespionage group Thrip and their tactics, techniques, and procedures. Thrip has been active since 2013 and originates from China. Recently, Thrip has shifted tactics to "living off the land", meaning using built-in OS features and legitimate tools to conduct attacks and blend in. Symantec uncovered a new campaign by Thrip starting in January 2018 when their Targeted Attack Analytics technology detected suspicious lateral movement using PsExec on a telecom's network in Southeast Asia. Further investigation revealed new malware tools Catchamas and an updated Rikamanu being distributed. Thrip targeted several concerning sectors including satellite communications, geospatial imaging, telecoms, and defense contractors in the US and Southeast Asia. Their interest in operational systems suggests potential motives beyond spying like disrupting satellites. In addition to living off the land tools like PowerShell and Mimikatz, Thrip deploys custom malware against high-value targets including the remote access tools Rikamanu and Catchamas. Symantec has protections against Thrip's activities and new malware tools. The post highlights how targeted attackers are increasingly living off the land, making detection challenging and requiring advanced analytics. It also underscores supply chain concerns with a China-based group compromising satellite operations.
