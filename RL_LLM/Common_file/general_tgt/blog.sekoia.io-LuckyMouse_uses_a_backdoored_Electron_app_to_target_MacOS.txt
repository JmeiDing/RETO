The PDF discusses a campaign by the Chinese state-sponsored threat actor group LuckyMouse where they compromised and backdoored a messaging application called Mimi to target MacOS systems. Mimi is a Chinese messaging app developed by a company of unknown legitimacy. The MacOS version of the app was backdoored since May 2022 to download and install a Mach-O implant called RShell when launched. RShell connects to LuckyMouse infrastructure and can execute commands, interact with the filesystem, and more. It sends a hello packet with system info when executed and keeps alive messages every 40 seconds. While the campaign's objectives are unclear, it may be for domestic surveillance given Mimi's user base seems mostly Chinese. Or targets may be socially engineered into downloading the app to bypass censorship. Either way, it represents LuckyMouse expanding operations to target MacOS. Links are provided between the RShell implant, its command and control servers, and known LuckyMouse tools and infrastructure. LuckyMouse has compromised messaging apps before, but this is the first MacOS targeting observed. The PDF provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, domains, IPs, and YARA rules associated with the backdoored Mimi app and RShell implant. It highlights the need to monitor LuckyMouse's continuing evolution of tactics, techniques, and procedures.
