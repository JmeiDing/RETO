The document analyzes a potential instance of cyberattacks attributed to a threat actor group called APT Sidewinder. It examines similarities and differences to known Sidewinder attacks. The attack used a dropper with techniques seen in Sidewinder campaigns, like downloading an HTA file, decoding a backdoor, and using similar filenames. However, there were also many differences: - The dropper downloaded the HTA from an Indian academic website, unlike Sidewinder targeting South Asian government/military organizations. - The network protocols were very different, with no encryption and a plain text protocol. Sidewinder uses HTTP requests to C2 servers. - The execution chain did not use .NET serialization like Sidewinder. The backdoor was coded in Delphi, while Sidewinder uses C++ or VB6. - The backdoor itself matched an open-source project AllaKore_Remote on GitHub, which Sidewinder is not known to use. - Targeting was against Afghanistan civil society rather than Sidewinder's focus on Pakistan government/military. In summary, while some TTPs matched, many significant differences suggest this was not actually APT Sidewinder behind the attacks, but rather a copycat threat actor mimicking some of their methods. The attacks Leveraged an open-source backdoor and public infrastructure, unlike the sophisticated capabilities of Sidewinder.
