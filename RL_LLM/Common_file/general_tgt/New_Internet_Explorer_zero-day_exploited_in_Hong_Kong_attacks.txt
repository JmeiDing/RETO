A new zero-day vulnerability in Internet Explorer was exploited in attacks before being patched by Microsoft this week. The attacks involved compromising a Hong Kong church website and adding malicious iframes to redirect visitors to an exploit server. The server hosted files that exploited the IE vulnerability (CVE-2015-2502) and installed the Korplug backdoor malware. Korplug is an information stealing trojan that maintains persistence on infected systems. It has been used in Asia over the past few years. The vulnerability allows remote code execution if a user views a malicious web page in IE, giving the attacker the same privileges as the current user. Microsoft patched the bug as part of Security Bulletin MS15-093. Symantec protected against the exploit with signatures detecting the malicious scripts. The attacks show sophisticated hackers move quickly to weaponize zero-days before patches are available. Users should apply updates as soon as possible.
