The PDF describes cyberattacks attributed to an Iranian threat group called OilRig that targeted organizations in Israel and the Middle East starting in late 2015. OilRig set up fake websites impersonating a VPN portal, the University of Oxford, and job sites. The fake sites hosted malware bundled with legitimate software. In one attack, emails with fake VPN credentials sent users to a portal that prompted them to install a file containing the Helminth malware and legitimate Juniper VPN software. The malware files were digitally signed with valid but likely stolen certificates issued to AI Squared. In other incidents, fake Oxford university sites hosted malware disguised as registration tools and CV creators. The malware used command and control domains like updater[.]li. OilRig also sent weaponized Excel files in some attacks. There is infrastructure overlap between OilRig and two other Iran-based groups called Cadelle and Chafer, suggesting they may be related entities. OilRig continues to target Middle Eastern organizations and improve technical capabilities like code signing and software bundling. Indicators of compromise like file hashes, domain names, and IP addresses are provided. The attacks demonstrate how adversaries impersonate trusted entities and leverage legitimate platforms to avoid detection when compromising targets.
