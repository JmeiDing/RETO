The document analyzes recent activity by the cyberespionage group Cloud Atlas, which Kaspersky Lab has been tracking since 2014. The actor has been active since 2014, and its TTPs (Tactic Tools and Procedures) have not changed since 2018. Cloud Atlas conducts spearphishing campaigns aimed at high-value targets in Russia, Central Asia, and conflict zones in Ukraine. In 2019, Cloud Atlas has continued using its existing tactics, which involve sending emails with malicious Office docs that retrieve remote templates to compromise victims. Previously the group exploited Microsoft Equation vulnerability directly, but now uses a new infection chain. This starts with a polymorphic HTA file which drops a new polymorphic VBS implant called VBShower. VBShower acts as a validator, executing the group's PowerShower backdoor payload. PowerShower is a PowerShell implant that can execute additional modules sent by the attackers. The PowerShower backdoor takes three commands and saves received content as ZIP or VBS files for execution. Seen modules include a document stealer, password stealer using the tool LaZagne, and a reconnaissance module. VBShower sends context files to the remote server every hour and tries to get a VBS script to execute. VBShower tries to delete forensic evidence and retrieves VBS scripts to execute. One such script installs the Cloud Atlas modular backdoor first revealed in 2014, which communicates via WebDAV. By frequently changing implants and attack chains, Cloud Atlas aims to evade defenses based on Indicators of Compromise. The group continues relying on its simple but effective tactics, spearphishing and malicious documents. Even after 5 years, the main backdoor remains unchanged due to its modular nature. The report provides an overview of how the group is evolving its initial infection tactics while maintaining strategic malware like PowerShower and its backdoor.
