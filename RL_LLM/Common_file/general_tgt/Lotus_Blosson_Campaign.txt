The report analyzes the ESILE/Lotus Blossom targeted attack campaign that has been active since at least 2007, targeting countries in Southeast Asia. The attacks start with a spear-phishing email containing a malicious Office document. If opened, it uses an exploit to install the ESILE backdoor malware. ESILE establishes persistence via a Windows service or autorun registry entry. The initial command and control information is embedded in the dropper. The malware randomly generates fake file property dates but uses a fixed algorithm, allowing recognition of ESILE files. Some versions contain identifying resource strings. ESILE generates dynamic URLs for command and control based on the victim's MAC address and current time. This pattern can help detect C2 traffic. Solutions like Trend Micro's custom defense and advanced threat protection can detect and block ESILE at various points during infection. Specific detections for attachments, droppers, and backdoor actions are available. The report provides an overview of ESILE's architecture and behaviors to help the security community continue tracking this long-running targeted attack campaign out of Southeast Asia. In summary, the report analyzes the components, infrastructure, and capabilities of the ESILE/Lotus Blossom campaign, providing detections and recommendations to defend against this advanced persistent threat.
