The document describes cyberattack activities by a financially-motivated threat actor group called Blind Eagle or APT-C-36. Blind Eagle has been conducting attacks against organizations in South America since at least 2018. The report details a recent Blind Eagle campaign targeting Ecuador-based organizations with more advanced tools compared to their typical operations. The infection chain involves phishing emails with malicious links that lead to multi-stage malware installation. The initial stages use Python scripts and abused legitimate services to eventually deploy Meterpreter payloads. Unlike Blind Eagle's normal crimeware, the backdoors here are more akin to espionage-related malware. The attackers have added both a link and a terse attached PDF directing the unfortunate victim to the exact same link in their phishing emails. Blind Eagle typically focuses narrowly on a single country at a time. Their attacks against Colombia often spoof the government. The report speculates that having multiple versions of the malware may provide redundancy. The technical analysis examines Blind Eagle's evolving tradecraft - adding features to publicly available tools, intricate multi-stage infections, and living off the land techniques. The report concludes Blind Eagle is becoming more sophisticated and their geographic targeting makes them a persistent threat in South America warranting monitoring. In summary, this report provides an overview of a recent cyberespionage campaign by the Blind Eagle group against Ecuador, illustrating their increasing maturity and use of advanced tools for regional targets.
