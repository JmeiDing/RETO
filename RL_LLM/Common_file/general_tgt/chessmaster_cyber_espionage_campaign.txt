The document analyzes a cyberespionage campaign called ChessMaster that is targeting organizations in Japan across academia, technology, media, managed service providers, and government. The campaign employs various poisoned pawns in the form of malware-laden spear-phishing emails containing decoy documents. ChessMaster uses various techniques in its attacks: - Malicious LNK and PowerShell files to deliver its main malware ChChes. - Self-extracting archives that perform DLL hijacking to execute payloads. - Packed versions of ChChes with anti-analysis features. ChessMaster hides part of the decryption key and payload in registry keys to make it harder to reverse engineer. - Additional backdoor malware for persistence like RedLeaves and TinyX. - Hacking tools modified to dump credentials. There are links between ChessMaster and the Chinese APT10 group based on similar infrastructure, targeting, tools, and techniques. ChChes resembles the Emdivi backdoor used by APT10. The report provides an overview of the attack chain and recommendations like defense in depth, securing email gateways, patching, behavior monitoring, and fostering cybersecurity awareness to defend against such targeted attacks. Indicators of compromise associated with ChessMaster are included. In summary, this reveals and analyzes the sophisticated malware tools and techniques used by the ChessMaster cyberespionage campaign targeting Japan, which has ties to Chinese threat actors.
