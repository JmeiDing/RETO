Spearphishing emails containing links are sent to targets. The links go to compromised websites hosting weaponized Excel docs. Victims are lured into enabling macros in the Excel docs. The macro code writes and executes multiple components: A VBS script to download the BackConfig loader executable. A "setup" batch script that configures the environment. The batch script creates scheduled tasks to execute the components: The VBS script runs after 20 mins to download the loader. The loader runs every 10 mins to beacon to the C2 server. The BackConfig loader establishes command and control to receive additional payloads and modules. Further capabilities like reconnaissance, keylogging etc. are provided via the BackConfig plugins.
