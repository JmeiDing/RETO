The PDF analyzes a leaked tool called MuddyC3 which was used by the Iranian state-sponsored threat actor group MuddyWater. MuddyC3 is a Python-based command and control server that delivers PowerShell-based malware. The author was able to revive the non-functioning MuddyC3 code by creating a proof-of-concept PowerShell agent payload. The agent collects system info, checks for commands, executes commands, and uploads results. The PDF provides technical analysis of how MuddyC3 and the PowerShell agent work, including: - How the command and control interface functions - An overview of the webserver code and URLs used by the agent - How the agent registers, gets commands, executes commands, and uploads results - How modules can be remotely loaded into memory It demonstrates using the tool to obtain domain admin credentials by loading Mimikatz and Pass-the-Hash modules. The author notes encryption and AV evasion limitations in the proof-of-concept which will be addressed in their upcoming enhanced tool. Overall, the PDF provides a comprehensive look at how this leaked Iranian malware works along with the process to reconstruct and use it in a real red team scenario.
