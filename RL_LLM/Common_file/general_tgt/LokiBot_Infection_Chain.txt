The report provides an in-depth look at a recent LokiBot malware campaign. It starts with a phishing email containing an Excel sheet with blurred images and macros. The obfuscated macro fetches an encrypted second-stage downloader, which then retrieves the encrypted third stage containing the final LokiBot payload. The second-stage downloader uses a custom packer and decryption techniques to evade detection and make analysis difficult. It performs various checks before fetching the third stage. The third stage decrypts its configuration to determine how to escalate privileges and deploy LokiBot. It abuses two different UAC bypass techniques to gain admin rights. LokiBot itself is hidden within three encryption layers that are peeled back before execution. In total, the infection chain utilizes social engineering, macro obfuscation, packers, encrypted download stages, anti-analysis checks, privilege escalation, and process injection to ultimately deploy the information-stealing LokiBot payload. The report examines the code in detail at each stage, highlighting the deobfuscation and decryption steps required for analysis. It demonstrates the increasing sophistication of malware authors to avoid defenses through complex multi-stage infection tactics.
