The document is a malware analysis report on the Brunhilda malware distribution framework. Brunhilda is a dropper service that utilizes the Google Play Store to distribute banking malware, currently the Alien malware. It registers victims based on language settings, dropping malware disguised as authenticator or fitness apps. Once installed, Alien gathers phone info and sends it to a command and control server. It uses accessibility services to overlay phishing screens on banking/financial apps to steal login credentials. Alien can also read/send SMS, make calls, record audio, and more. The report analyzes the command panel, dropper apps, and Alien capabilities. It provides indicators of compromise like IP addresses and app package names. The report concludes by recommending immediately blocking listed IPs associated with this malware distribution framework.
