The document analyzes recent activity by the North Korean threat actor group Kimsuky, also known as Golddragon or Braveprince. It first looks at malware from the Golddragon/Braveprince cluster that steals information and communicates with a command and control server. This malware now includes a routine to encode API names to evade detection. The second sample is an information stealer that gathers system data, account credentials from browsers, and exfiltrates the information. This appears to be a module used by other Kimsuky malware. The third sample leverages the open source Quasar RAT. It uses privilege escalation techniques to disable Windows Defender before dropping the RAT payload. This payload communicates with C2 servers and has code similarities to previous Kimsuky malware. In summary, the analysis examines three new malware samples attributed to the Kimsuky group based on code reuse, tactics, and other similarities to known activity. It highlights the ongoing evolution of their malware to gather data from compromised systems and communicate with command and control infrastructure.
