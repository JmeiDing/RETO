The post examines recent activity by the threat actor Nobelium, who was behind the 2020 SolarWinds supply chain attack. In February 2021, Nobelium began a new spearphishing campaign distributing Cobalt Strike beacons via ISO files attached to emails. Cobalt Strike, a legitimate penetration testing tool, has become increasingly popular amongst threat actors due to its many powerful features. The emails used various lures and evolved over several waves from February to May 2021. Nobelium uses a variety of tools to infect systems and hide its presence, including: - EnvyScout: a malicious HTML file that writes a malware-laden ISO to disk - BoomBox: a downloader that collects system information and retrieves additional payloads - NativeZone : Custom Cobalt Strike loader previously tracked as TEARDROP - VaporRage : Shellcode downloader malware payload used to retrieve Cobalt Strike granting Nobelium remote access, credential collection and other capabilities. The campaign targeted more than 3,000 accounts from more than 150 organizations. Infrastructure analysis identified domains impersonating banks, indicating the targets were located in Latin America. Microsoft analyzed four malware tools used by Nobelium and provided an IoC. Recommendations include keeping software updated, disabling unnecessary services/protocols, enforcing the use of strong passwords, monitoring network traffic, and staying aware of the latest threats.
