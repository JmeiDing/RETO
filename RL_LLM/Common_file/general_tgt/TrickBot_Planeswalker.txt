The PDF describes the sophisticated malware operations of a threat actor group associated with TrickBot malware. TrickBot evolved from a banking trojan into a flexible, modular crimeware framework. The group developed an "Anchor" project that combines tools for initial infection, persistence, cleanup, and more into an all-in-one attack framework. Components include installers, uninstallers, bot malware, utilities to manipulate binaries, and PowerShell command execution. Anchor leverages both custom tools and existing frameworks like Metasploit and Cobalt Strike. It uses evasion techniques like encryption, encoded strings, and process injection. Analysis of command and control traffic revealed Anchor infections downloading PowerRatankba, a remote access trojan linked to the Lazarus APT group. This suggests potential collaboration between cybercriminal and nation-state groups. Another payload is "MemScraper," a POS malware that scrapes memory for payment card data. It comes in HTTP and DNS exfiltration versions and shares code with Anchor. The modular, multifunctional nature of Anchor provides flexibility for attackers. Blending crimeware and APT tools also makes attribution more difficult. Recommendations include behavior-based detections, endpoint monitoring, and threat intelligence.
