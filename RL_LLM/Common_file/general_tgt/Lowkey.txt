The PDF describes analysis of malware used by the threat actor group APT41. The malware uses multiple layers of encryption, including RC5 and RC4, to obfuscate payloads. Researchers were able to decrypt payloads by brute forcing RC5 keys derived from system volume serial numbers. This revealed additional obfuscation layers and full file paths/names from the malware developers. Decrypted payloads included the remote access trojan POISONPLUG, XMRig cryptocurrency miner, and a sophisticated passive backdoor named LOWKEY. LOWKEY has TCP and HTTP variants that covertly listen on ports 53 and 80. It uses named pipes for command and control. Commands support file management, process management, and a reverse shell. The TCP variant uses a rootkit component to intercept and forward traffic to LOWKEY. Overall, the malware uses advanced techniques like rootkits, traffic relay, and API hooking to evade detection. Decryption and analysis of the payloads revealed sophisticated capabilities and provided insights into APT41's development environment. The malware demonstrates APT41's continued evolution and investment into covert access tools.
