Cybersecurity firm Cynet analyzed a new malware campaign dubbed BumbleBee used by initial access brokers to compromise targets. BumbleBee leverages ISO image files distributed via phishing links instead of traditional Office documents to initially infect victims when they mount the ISO. The ISO contains shortcut files that use living-off-the-land binaries like rundll32 to execute the BumbleBee payload, a custom loader DLL. BumbleBee uses anti-analysis checks for sandboxes and VMs and collects system info to send to its command and control server. Once loaded, BumbleBee injects Cobalt Strike beacons into memory for further access, lateral movement, and data theft. Persistence is achieved via scheduled tasks and WMI executing Visual Basic scripts that reload the malware. Attackers actively used BumbleBee in incidents compromising US companies observed by Cynet, typically leading to follow-on ransomware attacks. BumbleBee shows initial access brokers shifting tactics due to tightened Office macro security, adopting stealthy fileless techniques to distribute next-stage malware. In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at BumbleBee's technical features and attacker tactics as an emerging initial access malware taking the place of traditional Office document-based infections.
