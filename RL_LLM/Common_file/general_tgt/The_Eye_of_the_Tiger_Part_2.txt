The document analyzes a cyberespionage threat actor group named Pitty Tiger that has been active since at least 2010. The group uses spearphishing to target victims with malware like the PittyTiger remote access Trojan (RAT). Once compromised, the attackers install additional RATs like CT RAT, MM RAT, and Paladin RAT to establish remote access and steal data. The group registers domains impersonating security vendors and uses compromised servers for command and control. Victims include a defense industry company, an academic network, and other companies in Europe. The attackers connect from IP addresses primarily in China. The team structure includes bot operators, malware developers, coordinators, and customer relationship roles. The attackers have amassed an arsenal of custom and public tools for reconnaissance, exploitation, exfiltration, and maintaining access. The use of Chinese tools, language resources, hosting locations, and vulnerabilties points to a Chinese origin threat actor. The Pitty Tiger group demonstrates the sophisticated tools and techniques of a professional cyberespionage operation. Ongoing monitoring and protections against spearphishing, malware, and unauthorized network access are recommended to mitigate the threat. The report provides indicators of compromise to assist potential targets.
