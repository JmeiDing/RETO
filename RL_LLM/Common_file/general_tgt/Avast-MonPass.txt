Avast discovered the client software from Mongolian certificate authority MonPass was backdoored with Cobalt Strike from February 8 to March 3, 2021. The backdoored installer downloads and installs the legitimate MonPass software to avoid suspicion, while also downloading and decrypting the malware. Multiple versions of the backdoored installer were found, some with minor differences in encryption and anti-analysis techniques. The malware uses steganography to hide the payload in an image file downloaded from the attacker's server. Additional backdoored files with similar functionality were found hosted on the compromised MonPass server. While attribution is unclear, the attackers compromised a trusted source to spread malware to users in Mongolia.
