In February 2014, FireEye uncovered a cyberattack dubbed Operation SnowMan that exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Internet Explorer 10 to target visitors to the US Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) website. FireEye believes the attackers are associated with previous campaigns called Operation DeputyDog and Operation Ephemeral Hydra based on infrastructure and tool overlaps. The attackers added malicious iframe code to the VFW website that silently redirected visitors through the IE 10 exploit hosted on another domain. The exploit could bypass EMET and ASLR protections to achieve remote code execution. It dropped a malware payload encoded as a JPEG image which extracted and executed a ZxShell backdoor. The ZxShell variant used in this attack connected to a command and control server that was linked to previous DeputyDog and Ephemeral Hydra activity through IP resolutions and tool usage. Those operations also used strategic website compromises and zero days to distribute remote access Trojans. FireEye notes the threat actors behind these campaigns have targeted a range of industries including government, law firms, IT companies, and NGOs in the past. Their ability to successfully deploy zero-day exploits indicates they are a sophisticated group that will likely continue operations long-term. The SnowMan campaign is another example of this actor leveraging a website trusted by their target audience (military veterans) to stealthily distribute malware using a zero-day exploit. It highlights the ongoing threat of strategic web compromises and necessity of securing websites against unauthorized code insertion.
