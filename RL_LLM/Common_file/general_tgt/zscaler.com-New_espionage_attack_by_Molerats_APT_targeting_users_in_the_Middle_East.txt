The report details a new cyberespionage campaign targeting users in the Middle East that is attributed to the Molerats APT group. The attacks have been ongoing since July 2021. The attackers distribute macro-basedOffice documents containing decoy content related to Israel-Palestine conflicts. The macros download malware written in .NET and packed with ConfuserEx. The malware collects system info, communicates with attacker C2 servers on Dropbox to receive commands, and exfiltrates data. It uses techniques like debugger checks and mouse movement detection to evade analysis. Infrastructure links like IP addresses, domain certificates, and email addresses connect these attacks to previous activity by Molerats. Targets include banking, political, and human rights related organizations in Palestine and Turkey. The attackers tailor social engineering lures to the region and evolve their tactics, recently moving to a PowerShell/HTML smuggling technique to distribute malware. They also use services like Google Drive for payload hosting. The report contains indicators of compromise and MITRE ATT&CK mappings. It demonstrates Molerats' continued targeting of the Middle East with new TTPs and evolving coder obfuscation techniques. Their end goals remain unclear. In summary, this report exposes an ongoing, sophisticated cyberespionage operation likely by the Molerats APT group using macro malware, social engineering, and infrastructure with historical ties to the threat actor. The attacks continue to target Middle Eastern organizations.
