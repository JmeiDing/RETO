The PDF describes a watering hole campaign that deployed new macOS malware called DazzleSpy to target pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. The attackers compromised two websites, one fake and one legitimate, that were visited by Hong Kong activists. They injected iframes that redirected visitors to exploit code if they were using Safari on macOS 10.15.2 or newer. The exploit utilized an undisclosed WebKit vulnerability to gain arbitrary code execution. It implemented primitives to read and write memory and corrupt objects to bypass browser protections. The exploit escalated privileges by exploiting CVE-2021-30869, a vulnerability disclosed in 2021. It downloaded and decrypted the DazzleSpy malware payload, granted it root access, and ensured it would run on startup. DazzleSpy is a full-featured backdoor with capabilities like command execution, screen recording, file exfiltration, and credential theft. It connects to a C&C server over encrypted TLS channels. Artifacts in the malware suggest its authors are Chinese speaking. The campaign shows the threat actors have strong technical skills to find and weaponize undisclosed vulnerabilities. The targeting of Hong Kong activists matches previous campaigns deploying iOS malware in similar watering hole attacks.
