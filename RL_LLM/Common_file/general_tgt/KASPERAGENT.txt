The PDF describes the discovery of a new malware campaign in April-May 2017 that uses KASPERAGENT malware. KASPERAGENT is a type of malware that has been used in targeted attacks in the Middle East since 2015. It was originally discovered and named by security researchers in April 2017. The new campaign uses KASPERAGENT variants that have some similarities to previous versions, including the use of the "OPAERA" user agent string. However, this campaign uses different command and control infrastructure, including the domain windowsnewupdates[.]com. The malware samples are distributed via documents that appear to be official Palestinian Authority correspondence and reference recent political events in Gaza. The documents are addressed to leaders of Hamas and discuss topics like the assassination of a Hamas military commander and the banning of the rival Fatah party. The command and control IP address hosting windowsnewupdates[.]com has also hosted other domains registered to individuals in Gaza. While attribution is not definitive, this suggests the threat actors or targets may be located in Palestine/Gaza. The timing of the campaign coincides with increased tensions between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority in March-May 2017. The malware could potentially target either side, as well as Israel which was blamed for the Hamas assassination. The official-looking decoy documents suggest the targets may be government employees or contractors. In summary, the PDF analyzes a new malware campaign leveraging KASPERAGENT with a focus on targets in Palestine/Gaza, distributed via politically-themed decoy documents relevant to recent events there. Technical details, associated indicators of compromise, and screenshots of decoy files are available in ThreatConnect.
