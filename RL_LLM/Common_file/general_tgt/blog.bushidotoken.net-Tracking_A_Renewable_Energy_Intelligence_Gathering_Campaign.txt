The document describes analysis of a cyberespionage campaign targeting renewable energy and industrial technology organizations that has been active since at least 2019. The campaign uses a custom "Mail Box" phishing kit to harvest employee credentials through fake login pages hosted on attacker infrastructure and compromised sites. Over 15 entities have been targeted, including companies like Schneider Electric, Honeywell, Huawei, universities, renewable energy facilities, environmental groups, and banks. There is a focus on Bulgaria, with phishing sites impersonating energy companies and banks there. Other targets align with renewable energy, environmental protection, and industrial tech. Attribution is unclear, but the targeting suggests the threat actor likely has an interest in fossil fuels and views renewables as a threat. Some infrastructure overlaps with previous APT28 and Konni campaigns. Tactics involve sending phishing emails to direct targets to credential harvesting pages designed to steal account access and enable data theft. The basic phishing kit and tactics point to an unsophisticated but ultimately effective campaign. The cyberespionage is ongoing through 2022 and aims to gather intelligence on the renewable energy sector, with Bulgaria a key area of attention for unknown reasons. In summary, this report provides an OSINT analysis of a cyberespionage campaign focused on renewables likely operated by an adversary with interests in the fossil fuel industry.
