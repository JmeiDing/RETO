The document describes a targeted cyberattack campaign originating from India that has been active for at least two years, aimed at stealing sensitive information from organizations, particularly in Pakistan. The attackers used a code signing certificate issued to an Indian company in late 2011 to sign malicious binaries to improve their spread. Over 70 signed malware samples were found, with a timeline showing they were actively signing binaries from March to June 2012. The infection vectors involved exploiting the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability in Microsoft Office documents, and PE files disguised as Word or PDF documents distributed via email. The droppers installed various payloads focused on exfiltrating data, including downloaders, keyloggers, screenshot takers, and tools to search and upload documents. The payloads sent the stolen information unencrypted to attacker servers. Analysis of the command and control infrastructure uncovered over 20 domains, many hosted by OVH which is known for hosting malware. The domain names closely resembled real sites or companies. The timestamps of the signed binaries pointed to Indian Standard Time work shifts. Strings in the binaries referenced Indian culture. Telemetry showed many malware variants appearing in the same region of India. While Pakistan appears to be the most targeted, infections were seen globally. However, the attackers did not use advanced techniques for obfuscation or encryption, relying on simple rotation ciphers and no cryptography. The persistence techniques and use of publicly available tools also pointed to a lack of sophistication. The summarized findings paint a picture of a cyberespionage campaign originating from India, aimed at targets in Pakistan and elsewhere, using fairly basic malware but achieving some success in stealing sensitive data.
