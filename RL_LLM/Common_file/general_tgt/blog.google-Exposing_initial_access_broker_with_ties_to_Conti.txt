Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has been tracking a financially motivated threat actor named EXOTIC LILY that exploits vulnerabilities and works as an initial access broker. EXOTIC LILY appears linked to the ransomware groups Conti and Diavol, and the cybercrime group WIZARD SPIDER/FIN12. At its peak, EXOTIC LILY was sending 5,000 phishing emails a day to 650 organizations. EXOTIC LILY uses social media profiles and email spoofing to send spear phishing emails under the guise of business proposals, such as outsourcing software development projects or information security services. The attackers would schedule meetings with their targets to discuss project design or requirements, and then upload payloads to public file-sharing services using built-in email notification features. This makes it challenging for detection systems to identify the attacker's email address. Human-operated phishing at scale is a common tactic used by EXOTIC LILY operators, who customize initial proposal templates, handle further communications with targets, and upload malware from other groups to file-sharing services before sharing it with the target. EXOTIC LILY has switched from delivering documents containing an exploit for CVE-2021-40444 to delivering ISO files with hidden BazarLoader DLLs and LNK shortcuts. These samples have indicators that suggest they were custom-built for the group. While EXOTIC LILY operates independently, focusing on acquiring initial access through email campaigns, it collaborates with other actors to deploy Conti and Diavol ransomware. Google is improving user protection by adding additional warnings for emails originating from website contact forms, better identification of spoofing, and adjusting the reputation of email file sharing notifications.
