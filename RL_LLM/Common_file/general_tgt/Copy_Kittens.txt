The document analyzes the tactics, techniques, and procedures of a threat actor group named CopyKittens that has been conducting cyberattacks in the Middle East since at least 2015. The group uses spearphishing emails with weaponized Office documents to gain initial access. The documents contain malicious scripts that execute a multi-stage malware framework called Matryoshka. The document explains six key points about this attack cycle: 1. Spear Phishing: The first step in the attack cycle involves sending a spear-phishing email to the target user with a malicious PDF attachment. 2. Droppers Matryoshka: The second step involves dropping a Matryoshka dropper onto the target system. This dropper contains a SCR PE file and a reflective loader component. 3. Reflective Loader: The third step involves injecting the reflective loader into the target system's memory. This component allows the malware to run without being detected by antivirus software. 4. RAT Component: The fourth step involves injecting a remote access tool (RAT) component into the target system. This component provides the attacker with full control over the infected machine. 5. Obfuscation Techniques: To evade detection, the attackers use obfuscation techniques such as runtime API address resolution and substitution ciphers to hide the true functionality of the RAT component. 6. Installation and Persistence: The final step involves installing and persisting the malware on the target system. This includes creating registry keys and task schedules to ensure that the malware remains active even after reboots or system crashes. The malware components show evidence of reusing code from open source projects and online forums. The group constantly evolves the malware to evade detection, adding anti-analysis and obfuscation. Known targets include diplomats, government officials, and academic researchers in the Middle East, especially connected to Israel. The exact actors behind the group are unknown but appears to be mid-level operators reusing public code. Their ongoing development of the mature malware framework continues to make them an effective threat in the region.
