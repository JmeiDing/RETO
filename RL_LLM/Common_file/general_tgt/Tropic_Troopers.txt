The PDF discusses attacks by a threat actor group called Tropic Trooper that targets government, military, and other organizations in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. - Tropic Trooper has been active since at least 2011, using spear phishing and weaponized attachments to steal information. - Their latest campaign uses a type of USB malware called USBferry to target air-gapped networks of military and government organizations. - USBferry infects air-gapped systems by copying itself to USB devices that are then inserted into the isolated systems. It can collect files and data from the air-gapped system and transfer them out when the USB device is removed. - There are at least three versions of USBferry that have different capabilities for evading detection, executing commands, etc. The latest version resides in memory to hide itself. - Tropic Trooper first compromises related organizations like military hospitals to use as a jumping off point to get to the more secure air-gapped networks. - They have a variety of custom backdoors and tools to maintain access, communicate with compromised systems, scan networks, etc. Some use steganography to hide communications. - Recommendations include enforcing least privilege, keeping systems patched and updated, monitoring networks, and using security solutions that provide visibility and threat detection across the environment. Understanding the tactics and techniques of threat actors can help organizations better defend against targeted attacks.
