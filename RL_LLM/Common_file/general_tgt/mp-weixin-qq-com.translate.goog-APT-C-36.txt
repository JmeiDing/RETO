The PDF analyzes recent attack activities by the threat actor group APT-C-36, also known as Blind Eagle. APT-C-36 is suspected to originate from South America and primarily targets organizations in Colombia and surrounding countries. The group often uses spear phishing emails with PDF attachments to distribute RAR archives containing malicious VBS scripts. The scripts execute a multi-stage infection chain to eventually load remote access trojans like AsyncRAT and NjRAT. The RATs communicate with command and control servers to enable remote control of the victim. Analysis of a recent sample shows the VBS downloader executing a staged process to reflectively load DLLs which then inject the RAT payload into a signed process like RegAsm for stealth. The RAT contains modular components for keylogging, file transfer, remote desktop, etc. The group continuously evolves its malware, adding anti-analysis capabilities and AMSI bypass to evade detection. Payloads are hosted on various public platforms to avoid scrutiny. Attribution is tied to APT-C-36 based on TTP similarities with previous attacks, target focus on Colombia, malware author language, and other indicators. The group continues to be active with updated tools, suggesting an advanced actor with resources. Ongoing monitoring of APT-C-36 is recommended given its persistent threat to organizations in Colombia and South America. Sharing threat intelligence can help identify new tactics and protect against future attacks by this actor.
