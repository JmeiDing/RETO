The PDF provides an analysis of a recent phishing campaign targeting organizations in Ukraine. The attackers send emails with malicious Excel docs impersonating legitimate government documents. When opened, the Excel doc retrieves a second stage zip archive containing an obfuscated VBS script. The VBS script contains anti-sandboxing techniques and heavily obfuscated code to evade detection. It makes network calls to check if the target is in Ukraine and retrieve the final payload executable. The executable phones home to a C2 and can be used to gather system info and exfiltrate data. This campaign shows sophisticated operational security, with tailored decoy documents, conditional access to payloads, and anti-analysis measures. The malware has low detection rates initially. The attackers are selective in targeting rather than mass campaigns. The PDF provides technical analysis of the phishing docs, macro code, and VBS stages. It extracts key indicators like C2 domains and IP addresses. The actors are attributed to a group the researchers call GlowSpark, who they predict may be involved with recent wiper malware attacks in Ukraine. In summary, the PDF provides an in-depth look at a highly targeted, evasive phishing campaign against Ukrainian organizations, leveraging decoy documents and multi-stage malware with anti-analysis measures. Technical details are provided to aid detection and prevention.
