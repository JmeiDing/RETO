The PDF describes analysis of a new Android spyware called Chinotto used by the North Korean state-sponsored hacking group APT37. APT37 has been active since around 2012 targeting victims in Asia and other regions. Researchers discovered APT37 using Chinotto to target North Korean defectors, human rights activists, and others. Chinotto masquerades as a secure messaging app called SecureTalk but secretly collects sensitive data from infected devices. Analysis of Chinotto reveals it requests numerous permissions that allow it to access SMS messages, call logs, contacts, files, accounts, and other data. The code shows it collects this data and uploads it to the attacker's command and control server. The malware can also record audio, take commands from the attacker, and steal photos and audio files from external storage. Traffic analysis confirms it sends stolen data to the C&C server. Chinotto appears targeted at specific individuals rather than mass infection. It uses sophisticated techniques to avoid detection, trick users into installing it, and steal sensitive information. The report concludes with recommendations for users to only install apps from official stores, use security software, avoid suspicious links, keep devices updated, watch for signs of infection, and take precautions like resetting devices if infected. It advises financial entities to educate customers on malware threats. In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at how APT37 is using the new Chinotto spyware to secretly collect sensitive data from targets' devices, illustrating the ongoing threat of targeted mobile malware.
