The PDF describes an cyberespionage operation dubbed "Operation Woolen-GoldFish" conducted by a group known as Rocket Kitten. The group targeted organizations in Israel and Europe, including defense contractors, IT companies, government agencies, and universities. The group conducted two main campaigns: GHOLE Malware Campaign: Rocket Kitten sent spearphishing emails with malicious Office documents that dropped a malware called GHOLE when macros were enabled. GHOLE communicated with command and control servers to steal data. CWoolger Keylogger: More recent emails contained links to malicious files hosted on OneDrive that installed a keylogger called CWoolger developed by a threat actor named Wool3n.H4t. The keylogger recorded keystrokes and exfiltrated the logs to the attackers. Forensic analysis revealed the involvement of an Iranian threat actor Wool3n.H4t who developed malware and crafted spearphishing emails. Infrastructure links to Iran suggest the Iranian government may be behind the attacks. While the technical sophistication is not advanced, the group has successfully compromised high value targets. The report provides indicators of compromise like IP addresses, malware hashes, and email lures that can be used to detect Rocket Kitten activity. It concludes that the group remains active and dangerous despite its limitations, warranting further tracking and security measures.
