The document analyzes a targeted attack campaign that leveraged the India-China border dispute as a lure. The attack starts with a malicious Word document sent via email that appears to contain an article about the border tensions. The document contains a macro that executes a PowerShell command to run embedded shellcode. The shellcode is fileless and does not write anything to disk. It downloads a second stage shellcode pretending to be from a Microsoft domain using a fake HTTP host header. The second shellcode contains a Cobalt Strike beacon payload encrypted with a GIF header. The shellcode decrypts this payload and executes it. The beacon uses Domain Generated Algorithm (DGA) domain C2 servers and steganography to blend in. The attackers used the DKMC malware framework along with Cobalt Strike. While attribution is unclear, OceanLotus and TrickBot groups have used similar techniques. The campaign shows how adversaries leverage current geopolitical events as lures and evade detection via living off the land tools, fake headers, encryption, and proxy comms. In summary, this was a sophisticated, targeted attack abusing the India-China dispute to trick victims into downloading modular, fileless malware designed to evade detection while enabling the attackers to control compromised systems.
