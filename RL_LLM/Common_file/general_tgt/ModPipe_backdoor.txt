The PDF describes a backdoor malware called ModPipe that targets point-of-sale (POS) software used in the hospitality industry. ModPipe was discovered by researchers at ESET who have been tracking it since late 2019. ModPipe uses a modular architecture, with an initial dropper, a persistent loader, a main module, networking modules, and downloadable modules that add specific functionality. One module called GetMicInfo contains an algorithm designed to decrypt database passwords stored encrypted in the Windows registry, showing the malware authors have extensive knowledge of the targeted POS software. While the most sensitive payment data should be protected by encryption, the decrypted credentials allow access to other sensitive information like transaction data, system configurations, and customer names. The full motives behind the operation are unclear. ModPipe uses HTTP for command and control communication, encrypting messages with AES. It can inject modules into running processes like explorer.exe for stealth. Infected systems were primarily found in the restaurant and hospitality industry in the United States. To defend against ModPipe, the PDF advises keeping POS software updated, running updated operating systems, and using reliable security software to detect the malware. Indicators of compromise like IP addresses, file hashes, and MITRE ATT&CK techniques are provided.
