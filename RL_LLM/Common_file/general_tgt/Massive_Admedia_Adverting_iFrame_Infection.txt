The PDF describes a malware attack infecting WordPress sites by injecting malicious JavaScript code into .js files. The malware has the following characteristics: Encrypted code with 32-digit hex comments at beginning and end, containing an MD5 hash. Obfuscated code that decrypts to an iframe that loads ads/tracking from various domains. Sets a cookie to only infect first-time visitors. Uploads multiple backdoors to reinfect sites. The malicious domains were registered recently by the same person and hosted on DigitalOcean servers. The malware has evolved from a previous version late last year that used similar tactics. Many sites are experiencing constant reinfections as the malware updates frequently and spreads across sites hosted on the same account. To fully clean an infection, all sites/files must be cleaned and secured at once, not just the primary site. The post provides background on the attack, IOCs, advice for identification and remediation.
