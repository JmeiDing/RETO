The Stuxnet computer worm is a sophisticated piece of malware discovered in 2010 that appears designed to target industrial control systems, specifically a control system made by Siemens often used in critical infrastructure facilities such as power plants and nuclear facilities. Stuxnet is able to spread through removable devices and networks, remaining hidden and manipulating control systems. It infected facilities around the world, with Iran seemingly the primary target. The report analyzes Stuxnet as representing an emerging cyber warfare capability. It is professionally developed, designed for sabotage rather than data theft, and the first known malware specifically built to target industrial control systems. The complexity and expertise required to create Stuxnet points to development by a nation-state. Potentially intended to damage Iranian nuclear facilities, its spread highlights issues with the precision of cyber weapons and secondary effects. The report discusses how Stuxnet reveals vulnerabilities in industrial control systems used to manage critical civilian infrastructure. Successful sabotage could damage key facilities and have major physical consequences. Stuxnet provides other nations and groups a “blueprint” for similar attacks on infrastructure. Recommendations include improving encryption, network segmentation, and physical security for control systems. Issues raised include attributing responsibility for such attacks, formulating immediate responses, and whether an international treaty is needed to address this type of malicious code. The government's role in protecting private critical infrastructure and new authorities required are also discussed.
