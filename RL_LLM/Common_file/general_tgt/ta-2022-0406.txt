The report describes intrusion campaigns by a suspected Chinese state-sponsored group, tracked as TAG-38, targeting the Indian power sector. Campaigns from September 2021 to March 2022 compromised State Load Despatch Centres (SLDCs) in northern India near disputed border areas with China. SLDCs control grid operations and electricity dispatch. This follows similar targeting of Regional Load Despatch Centres by RedEcho. The group leveraged likely compromised DVR/IP camera devices worldwide as command and control for ShadowPad backdoor malware. The open source tool Fast Reverse Proxy was also used. Overlaps were found with tactics and infrastructure linked to other suspected Chinese groups. SLDCs offer minimal economic espionage value. Prolonged targeting of Indian critical infrastructure is assessed as pre-positioning for information gathering or contingency operations. Access to industrial control systems has not been observed. Mitigations focus on blocking known indicators, monitoring for unusual outbound traffic, securing internet-of-things devices, and leveraging threat intelligence for improved detection. The targeting is expected to persist amid ongoing border tensions between China and India.
