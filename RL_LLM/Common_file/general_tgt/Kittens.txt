The document analyzes a phishing campaign by the Iranian threat actor group Charming Kitten, also known as APT35 or Ajax. Charming Kitten has been active since 2014 targeting experts in academia, human rights activists, and media personnel, mainly in the Middle East, US, and UK. The report examines a new campaign in 2019 focused on non-Iranian academic researchers studying Iran and Iranian dissidents in the US. The attackers impersonate journalists and research institutions to send spear phishing emails inviting targets to fake events or to review their resumes on malicious sites. The phishing sites impersonate media organizations like Sky News and Deutsche Welle. Some sites also mimic Google services to steal credentials. The emails contain spelling and grammar errors. The phishing sites are hosted on servers in Bulgaria that exhibit technical overlaps with known Charming Kitten infrastructure. Email headers also contain trackers to monitor forwarding and collect victim geolocation data. Attribution to Charming Kitten is based on target profiles, social engineering tactics, reuse of domains from prior activity, and other technical indicators. The report provides IOCs like domain names, IPs, and MISP event IDs. In summary, the report analyzes and attributes a new wave of phishing from the Charming Kitten group against academics and dissidents. It showcases their ongoing reliance on social engineering and fake websites for initial access.
