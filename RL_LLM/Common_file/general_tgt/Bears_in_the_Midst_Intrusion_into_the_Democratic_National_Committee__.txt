The PDF describes an intrusion into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) network by two Russian cyber espionage groups - COZY BEAR and FANCY BEAR. COZY BEAR intruded into DNC in summer 2015 using spearphishing and SeaDaddy malware. They used encrypted powershell scripts and WMI for persistence. FANCY BEAR separately breached DNC in April 2016 using X-Agent and X-Tunnel tools. They also used powershell scripts and MimiKatz for credential theft. Both groups infiltrated DNC independently without coordination. This shows adversarial relationship between Russian intelligence agencies. The groups stole identical credentials from DNC systems. Their goals were political and economic espionage to benefit Russian government. DNC was compromised for about a year before detection. The adversaries used advanced tradecraft for command & control, persistence, and avoiding detection. Indicators of compromise like IP addresses, domains, and sample hashes are provided for both groups.
