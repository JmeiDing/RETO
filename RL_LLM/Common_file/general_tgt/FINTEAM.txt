Check Point researchers investigated targeted attacks using trojanized TeamViewer software, dubbed FINTEAM, against government finance authorities and embassy officials in Europe. The attacks start with Excel docs containing macros that fetch additional scripts to take screenshots and system info. A script then downloads a malicious TeamViewer DLL that steals credentials and allows remote code execution. Analysis of the infrastructure links these FINTEAM attacks to a hacker named "EvaPiks" active on Russian cybercrime forums. Previous posts indicate they developed the tools used in the attacks. The attacks have evolved over time, initially targeting Russian speakers with various droppers. The DLL malware functionality has also added features like browser history collection for financial sites. While the motivations are unclear, the focus on finance and government targets combined with the hacker's forum history suggests financial gain. The report aims to expose the attack tools, infrastructure, and possible perpetrator. Check Point recommends enabling protections like sandboxing and threat extraction to catch similar malware and unknown threats. The findings highlight the ongoing prevalence of trojanizing legitimate software in targeted attacks.
