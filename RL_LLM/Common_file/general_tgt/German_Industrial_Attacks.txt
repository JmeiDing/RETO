The document describes a series of industrial cyberattacks that targeted a German conglomerate in early 2016. The attacks used malware from the Winnti family, associated with threat actor groups BARIUM and LEAD. Winnti is notable for providing persistent access to target networks. BARIUM cultivates relationships with victims via social media before sending malware. LEAD relies more on brute force and SQL injection. Both target industrial and technology companies. Microsoft researchers used anomaly detection and machine learning to track Winnti infections globally. The malware is commonly disguised as legitimate files like ASPNET_FILTER.DLL. Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) can help mitigate these types of attacks by: Using threat intelligence to alert on indicators of attack associated with BARIUM, LEAD, and other groups. Detecting suspicious behaviors like abnormal service creation that occur during malware installation. Providing visual timelines and process trees to analyze the context of an attack. Isolating compromised machines from the network to prevent lateral movement. Stopping malicious files and communications across the enterprise The attacks on the German company went undetected for months, allowing extensive data exfiltration. With Windows Defender ATP, the time to detect and respond can be reduced to hours or minutes. This greatly reduces the potential impact of a breach. In summary, the document analyzes recent industrial cyberattacks, the use of Winnti malware, and security capabilities to detect and respond using Windows Defender ATP. Rapid detection and response are key to mitigating damage from persistent threats.
