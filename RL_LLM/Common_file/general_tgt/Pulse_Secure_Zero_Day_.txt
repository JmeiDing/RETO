The PDF describes various malware families and attack techniques that have been used to compromise Pulse Secure VPN appliances. It was published by FireEye Mandiant in April 2021. Multiple threat actors have exploited vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure products over time to bypass authentication, maintain persistent access, and steal credentials. Tactics include: - Modifying shared libraries to log credentials and bypass multi-factor authentication. FireEye tracks this as SLOWPULSE malware. - Injecting web shells like RADIALPULSE and PULSECHECK into Pulse Secure admin web pages. These allow command execution. - Toggling the filesystem between read-only and read-write modes to allow file modification. - Maintaining access after system upgrades using tools like ATRIUM. - Clearing logs to evade detection using a utility called THINBLOOD. The attacks targeted US defense contractors, government agencies, and others globally. FireEye assesses some activity overlaps with Chinese threat actor APT5. A previously unknown vulnerability, CVE-2021-22893, contributed to the initial infection vector in some cases. Pulse Secure and Ivanti released patches and tools to detect compromised systems. The PDF provides indicators of compromise, YARA rules, MITRE ATT&CK mappings, and other technical details on the malware families to help network defenders identify related activity.
