The report by Check Point Research provides an analysis of the cyberespionage group Cloud Atlas, which has been active since 2014 targeting critical infrastructure globally. Recently, Cloud Atlas has focused its activities on Russia, Belarus, and conflict zones in Ukraine and Moldova amidst rising geopolitical tensions surrounding the Russia-Ukraine war. The group uses spearphishing emails with weaponized Office documents to gain initial access. These documents retrieve malicious templates that exploit old Equation Editor vulnerabilities. Once compromised, the attackers install a Powershell backdoor called PowerShower and a .NET proxy tool to relay commands between servers. They also deploy a modular espionage framework for further control and data extraction. This framework uses encrypted configurations and cloud storage for command and control. The report discusses the group's latest victimology, tools, infrastructure, and tactics, techniques and procedures. It provides technical analysis of the backdoors, command and control, and evasion mechanisms. Indicators of compromise including document hashes, domains, and IP addresses associated with this campaign are also provided. The ATT&CK matrix outlines the different techniques employed at each stage of the attack lifecycle. Overall, the report gives defenders valuable insights into Cloud Atlas' recent activities, latest tools and malware, ongoing targeting, and recommendations for detection and prevention.
