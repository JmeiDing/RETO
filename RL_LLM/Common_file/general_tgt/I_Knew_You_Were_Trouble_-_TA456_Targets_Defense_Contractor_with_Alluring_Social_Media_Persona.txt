The report describes a years-long social engineering and malware campaign by the Iranian-aligned threat actor TA456 targeting an employee of an aerospace defense contractor. TA456 used the fake persona "Marcella Flores" on social media to build a relationship with the target across multiple platforms. In June 2021, TA456 sent the target a malicious Excel file containing a macro that deploys a reconnaissance malware dubbed LEMPO. LEMPO establishes persistence on the infected system and can collect system information, search for usernames/passwords, and exfiltrate data to a remote server controlled by TA456. The malware demonstrates TA456's efforts to compromise defense contractors and their supply chain. The report provides details on how LEMPO operates, including reconnaissance activities, exfiltration, and connectivity checks. Analysis suggests LEMPO is an updated version of TA456's previous Liderc malware. TA456 has used numerous fake personas like "Marcella" to target defense contractors and subsidiaries, aiming to eventually compromise larger primary targets. The report concludes that TA456's social engineering and cross-platform attacks make them one of the most persistent Iranian-aligned threats.
