The document describes an analysis tracking infrastructure linked to the threat actor group Hagga. Starting from a single IP address and C2 panel directory pattern associated with distributing the Agent Tesla info-stealer, researchers pivoted to identify more C2 servers used by Hagga. Key findings: - Hagga infrastructure is hosted on dedicated servers with providers QuadraNet and Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications. - A self-signed HTTPS certificate served as an indicator tying together multiple C2 panels. - Passive DNS revealed domain connections between the C2s. - Open ports analysis showed the C2s run on Windows servers likely using XAMPP web servers. - Examination of a backend MySQL server hosting Hagga C2 databases allowed attributing additional IPs contacting it to Hagga. - Ongoing monitoring of the MySQL server led to quick identification of new Hagga infrastructure as it was stood up. - Telemetry ultimately connected activity to IP addresses around Lahore, Pakistan. The summary demonstrates how an initial foothold into adversary infrastructure can be leveraged through pivoting to gain substantial visibility into a threat actor's operations. Continued monitoring andfingerprinting enables rapid detection of new infrastructure tied to the same group.
