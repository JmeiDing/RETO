The document describes two malware attacks targeting the Syrian opposition that were observed in early 2013. The attacks were attributed to pro-government electronic actors (PGEA) and show sophisticated social engineering tactics. The first attack distributes malware posing as the circumvention tool Freegate. Victims download an installer containing a legitimate copy of Freegate as well as a Remote Access Trojan called ShadowTech Rat. The RAT exfiltrates data and allows the attacker remote access. The second attack sends victims an email containing a ZIP file purporting to be a video from a pro-opposition Saudi cleric calling for jihad. The ZIP contains a Windows shortcut that launches a social engineering attack leading to infection with a different piece of malware. The malware in the second attack communicates with command and control servers in Syrian IP space. It attempts to download additional components and is made persistent through registry modifications. The malware uses crypters and decoy YouTube videos/news sites to avoid detection. The attacks showcase social engineering tactics tailored to the interests and vulnerabilities of the Syrian opposition. As opposition members grow more aware of threats, the attackers have innovated with new techniques like the Windows shortcut attack. Recommendations are made for users and Freegate developers to improve security. Overall, the attacks reflect persistent efforts by PGEA to compromise and spy on the Syrian opposition through targeted malware campaigns. The opposition is encouraged to be skeptical of unsolicited files and links and to improve security practices.
