The report analyzes attacks by a threat actor group called Inception targeting European organizations in October 2018. The attacks distribute Microsoft Word documents exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability to deploy a new PowerShell-based backdoor malware called POWERSHOWER. The documents use the Remote Templates feature in Word to retrieve additional payloads from attacker servers after opening on the victim's machine. Decoy content in the documents focuses on political topics to interest the targets. POWERSHOWER gathers system info, cleans up attack artifacts, and can download next stage payloads. Its coding shows efforts to evade detection and analysis. The reconnaissance nature and anti-forensics align with Inception's previous tactics of stealthy data theft. The report examines the attack chain and malware capabilities. It provides indicators of compromise and mitigation guidance for customers of Palo Alto Networks security products. The ongoing attacks demonstrate Inception's persistence in targeting European organizations through document exploits.
