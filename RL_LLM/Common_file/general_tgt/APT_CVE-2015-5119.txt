APT Group Wekby, a known threat group, has started using a recently patched Adobe Flash 0-day exploit in targeted spear phishing attacks. The APT group Wekby started using the exploit in spear phishing emails purporting to be from Adobe with a Flash update. The emails linked to a site hosting a malicious SWF file exploiting the Flash vulnerability to drop malware. The malware was a modified version of the Gh0st RAT, beaconing to a known Wekby command and control IP address. The exploit worked on Flash versions up to 18.0.0.194, so patching was critical. Signatures were provided to detect the malware. Other groups were also using the exploit. Patching Flash was highly recommended as attackers were actively exploiting it in the wild. The goal of this attack is to install malware on target systems. If a vulnerable system visits the exploit site from the spear phish message, the flash file would drop an executable into the victim's Temp directory, and the malware would then execute and immediately start beaconing to a Singapore IP address on TCP port 80.
