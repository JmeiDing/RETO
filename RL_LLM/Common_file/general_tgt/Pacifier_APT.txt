The PDF analyzes malware called Pacifier APT that was used in cyberespionage campaigns against Romanian institutions and other foreign targets starting in 2014. Pacifier is spread via spear phishing emails containing malicious Word documents and zip files. The initial infection starts with a Word document that contains an encrypted dropper. When macros are enabled, a script decrypts and executes the dropper, which drops clean documents and second-stage droppers. The second-stage droppers contain the malware components, which are extracted to the appdata folder. The main components are ntlm.exe, msvci.dll, msvcp.dll, msvck.dll, and msvct.dll, plus 64-bit versions. ntlm.exe starts the malware and uses msvcp.dll to find the PID of target processes like Outlook or browsers. msvci.dll injects the msvck.dll backdoor into the target process. msvct.dll handles command and control communication. The backdoor msvck.dll connects to hardcoded C2 servers and can receive commands like upload, download, execute, etc. Communications are encrypted. In 2015, a version was found that installs the backdoor as a malicious Firefox extension instead of injecting dlls. In 2016, updated versions were found that are stealthier, not dropping a main exe. DLLs are injected directly into Windows processes like dwm.exe. The 2016 versions have new C2 servers and use zip files containing js instead of macro Word docs. The js drops clean docs and malware. Analysis includes diagrams of the infection process and components, IOCs, decoy document examples, and hashes of known samples. The PDF provides an in-depth look at how the Pacifier APT evolved in tactics, techniques, and procedures from 2014-2016.
