The report describes a series of targeted cyberattacks beginning in January 2022 on military, industrial, and public sector organizations in several Eastern European countries and Afghanistan. The attackers used phishing emails with weaponized Office documents exploiting CVE-2017-11882 to distribute the PortDoor malware as an initial access vector. Multiple backdoors were installed on compromised systems including nccTrojan, Cotx, DNSep, Logtu, and a new one named CotSam. The backdoors provided remote access, command execution, and data exfiltration capabilities. Lateral movement involved use of the Ladon hacking framework for network reconnaissance and credential theft. The attackers moved through the network compromising additional systems and ultimately gained control of domain controllers to steal Active Directory hashes. Data was exfiltrated to stages one and two command and control servers located abroad and in China. Technical details are provided on the malware delivery techniques, command and control infrastructure, and the extensive capabilities of the backdoors. Attacks were precisely targeted against industrial control systems and IT networks. The report concludes a Chinese threat actor referred to as TA428 was likely responsible based on tactics, techniques, infrastructure, and victimology analysis. Recommendations for detection and prevention are included along with indicators of compromise.
