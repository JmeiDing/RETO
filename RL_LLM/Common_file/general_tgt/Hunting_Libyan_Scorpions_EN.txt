The report details an investigation by Cyberkov Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) into a politically-motivated cyberespionage campaign targeting high-profile Libyan figures. CSIRT named the threat actor group behind the campaign the Libyan Scorpions. In August 2016, CSIRT discovered Android malware spreading in Libya via phishing on Telegram. Analysis revealed the malware was injected into a legitimate Android app and communicated with a command and control server at winmeif.myq-see.com. The malware could exfiltrate extensive data from compromised devices including photos, audio recordings, location, calls/SMS logs and contacts. CSIRT believes the malware has ties to known Android remote access tools like JSocket and AlienSpy. CSIRT sinkholed the malware and analyzed the attacker infrastructure. The campaign dates back to at least September 2015 across 5 hostnames, with evidence of Windows and Android malware. Attribution details point to non-sophisticated, likely Arabic speakers in Libya. The report concludes with recommendations on protecting Android devices from such malware campaigns, as well as technical indicators of compromise for detection. CSIRT notes that using malware to spy on and track individuals in Libya's conflict areas endangers their lives.
