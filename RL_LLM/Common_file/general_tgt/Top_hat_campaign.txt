The report analyzes a Middle East-focused cyberespionage campaign called TopHat that uses lures related to Palestine and targets individuals in the region. Attackers distributed new malware called Scote via weaponized files exploiting CVE-2017-0199 and using Don't Kill My Cat (DKMC) BMP shellcode technique. Scote malware retrieves command and control instructions from Pastebin links and Google+ profiles contained in its configuration. It uses Bitly to obscure the C2 URLs. Scote can run commands, upload data, and load plugins downloaded from the C2. Researchers tied the threat actor to previous activity around the DustySky campaign through malware testing submissions that included new DustySky malware variants. The lures and targeting also align with Middle East focusing. The varied delivery techniques like RTFs, executables, RAR archives demonstrate attacker experimentation with different installation tactics. They tailor social engineering themes like Palestine leadership changes to the region. The report concludes the threat actor actively develops this malware, using TopHat victims to test its evasion capabilities. It will likely enhance Scote's features over time. Palo Alto Networks products detect the malware and infrastructure.
