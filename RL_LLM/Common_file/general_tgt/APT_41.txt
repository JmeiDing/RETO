APT41 is a prolific Chinese threat group that conducts both state-sponsored espionage and financially-motivated cybercrime operations. Their activity has been ongoing since 2014. For espionage, they target healthcare, telecoms, and high-tech sectors aligned with China's development plans. They also conduct surveillance on individuals. For cybercrime, they target the video game industry to manipulate currencies and steal source code and certificates to sign malware. Supply chain compromises infect legitimate files distributed to victims. Malware deployment is limited to specific targets. Personas associated with APT41 suggest they are contractors conducting espionage alongside their cybercrime activity. APT41 uses a diverse toolkit of over 46 malware families for initial access, persistence, and data theft. They are highly agile, responding quickly to changes.
