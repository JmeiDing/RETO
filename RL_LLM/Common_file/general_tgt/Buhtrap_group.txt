The document describes the activities of the Buhtrap cybercrime group, well-known for targeting financial institutions and businesses in Russia. However, since late 2015, Buhtrap has expanded its activities to also conduct espionage campaigns in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, using its crimeware tools to target government organizations. In June 2019, ESET researchers observed Buhtrap using a Windows local privilege escalation zero-day exploit (CVE-2019-1132) as part of one of its campaigns. The group continues to use NSIS installers and malicious documents to distribute malware payloads. Decoy documents provide clues to its shifting targets over time. Buhtrap's tactics of using vulnerabilities for privilege escalation to install malware has not changed much. ESET provides an analysis of the group's new tools, including a password stealer module and Meterpreter reverse shell tunnels over DNS. The report concludes with indicators of compromise, detection names for ESET products, and MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with this group's evolving capabilities.
