The report describes a new malware called PseudoManuscrypt that has been used in a large-scale spyware attack campaign targeting over 35,000 systems globally. The malware has some similarities to Manuscrypt malware used by the Lazarus APT group, but the scale of attacks is much wider than typical for an APT operation. The malware spreads via pirated software installers distributed on a malware-as-a-service platform. It steals extensive data including keystrokes, screenshots, microphone recordings, and VPN credentials. Victims include industrial control systems in sectors like engineering, energy, and manufacturing. Analysis suggests the threat actor may have ties to China based on language preferences in the malware code, use of a network protocol previously seen in tools of the APT41 Chinese group, and developer activity times. However, the objectives remain unclear. The report concludes that the large number of systems compromised globally makes this a serious threat. Recommendations are provided like using endpoint protection on all systems, restricting user privileges, enabling multi-factor VPN authentication, and security training to avoid infection. Continued investigation is underway to uncover more details on the campaign.
