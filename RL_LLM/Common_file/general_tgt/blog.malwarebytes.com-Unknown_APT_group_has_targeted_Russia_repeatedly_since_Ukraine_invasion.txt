The document describes four spear phishing campaigns conducted by an unknown advanced persistent threat (APT) group targeting Russian government entities since late February 2022. The campaigns aim to infect targets with remote access trojan (RAT) malware that can surveil compromised systems and run commands remotely. Lures include an interactive Ukraine map, fake Log4j patches, Saudi Aramco job ads, and Rostec-themed files. The phishing emails urge targets to enable macros or run attachments to trigger multi-stage infection chains ultimately installing the custom RAT payload. The RAT exhibits sophisticated anti-analysis techniques and uses encrypted C2 communications to hinder analysis. The RAT can fingerprint systems, upload/download files, and run arbitrary commands from its C2 server. Infrastructure links suggest potential Chinese origins but attribution remains unconfirmed. The repeated recent attacks against Russian targets indicate an opportunistic threat actor leveraging the Ukraine invasion as a lure topic. The campaigns exemplify covert cyber espionage supporting national interests and intelligence gathering around the conflict.
