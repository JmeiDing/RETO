The document analyzes activity by Patchwork, an Indian threat actor that targets Pakistan, in a campaign from November-December 2021. Patchwork distributed a new variant of the BADNEWS remote access trojan (RAT) called Ragnatela via spearphishing emails with weaponized RTF attachments. The RTF exploits execute shellcode to install the Ragnatela RAT, which features keylogging, screenshotting, command execution, and data exfiltration capabilities. Patchwork used typosquatted domains and impersonated Pakistani authorities to trick targets. Interestingly, Patchwork operators infected themselves with their own RAT, allowing visibility into their tools, infrastructure, and activities like using VPNs and testing in VMs. The campaign targeted Pakistani military and academics unlike previous Patchwork targeting. Through self-infection, the researchers gained insight into Patchwork's inner workings, showing continued malcode development and evolving targeting within their long-running cyber espionage operations against Pakistani interests.
