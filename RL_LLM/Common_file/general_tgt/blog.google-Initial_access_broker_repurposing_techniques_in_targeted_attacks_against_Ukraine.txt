The blog post discusses the activities of a threat actor group called UAC-0098, which Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) assesses includes former members of the Conti cybercrime group. UAC-0098 has historically spread banking malware but has shifted to targeting organizations in Ukraine, the Ukrainian government, and European NGOs and non-profits. TAG first noticed UAC-0098 in April 2022 distributing the AnchorMail backdoor through phishing emails with Ukraine-themed lures. Since then, UAC-0098 has conducted various campaigns delivering malware like IcedID, Cobalt Strike, and exploiting Follina. The group has impersonated Ukrainian law enforcement, Elon Musk's StarLink, and Microsoft to trick targets into downloading malware. UAC-0098 frequently changes tactics and tools but has repeatedly targeted hospitality businesses in Ukraine. The group's activities overlap with the Conti cybercrime group, using the same tools like IcedID, EtterSilent builder, and the Stolen Images Evidence service. Shared code suggests IcedID and Cobalt Strike payloads are encrypted by the same service. TAG concludes that UAC-0098 exemplifies the blurring lines between cybercriminals and state-backed groups in Eastern Europe as threat actors shift focus to align with geopolitics. TAG shared the report to help the security community investigate and defend against this threat.
