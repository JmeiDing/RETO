The blog post describes a new form of Linux malware called Symbiote that was discovered in November 2021. Symbiote is a highly evasive malware that infects running processes on Linux systems using a method called LD_PRELOAD, provides rootkit functionality, credentials harvesting, and remote access capability. Once loaded into a process, Symbiote hides its presence and any other files or processes used by the threat actor deploying it. This makes Symbiote extremely difficult to detect using normal forensic methods. Symbiote uses several techniques to remain hidden on an infected system. It hooks functions in common libraries like libc and libpcap to filter results that would expose its files, processes, or network activity. It also injects BPF bytecode to hide malicious network connections and logs keystrokes and credentials to later exfiltrate via DNS requests. The malware appears targeted at financial institutions in Latin America based on domain names impersonating major Brazilian banks. Passive DNS analysis uncovered related infrastructure and samples that suggest the threat actor used VirusTotal to test Symbiote before deployment. While Symbiote shares some similarities with past Linux malware like Windigo/Ebury, code analysis shows it does not reuse any code and is a new, previously undetected threat. Its stealthy nature and credential harvesting objectives make it a dangerous new malware targeting Linux systems.
