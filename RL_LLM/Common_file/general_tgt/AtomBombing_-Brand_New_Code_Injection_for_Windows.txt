This PDF document is about a new type of code injection technique called "AtomBombing" for Windows systems. The main idea behind this technique is to add shellcode to the global atom table of another process and then use APC (Automatic Procedure Call) to execute it. It works in 3 stages - writing arbitrary data to the target process, executing the code by hijacking a thread, and restoring the thread's execution. The global atom table is used to write shellcode to the target process. APCs invoke ROP chain to allocate RWX memory, copy shellcode, and execute it. The ROP chain pivots the stack to point to the parameters needed for functions like NtAllocateVirtualMemory and memcpy. Shellcode execution is achieved by ret instruction into allocated RWX memory containing shellcode. Original thread execution is restored by using context pointer and ZwContinue after shellcode finishes.
