The report describes malware campaigns conducted by a threat actor group called TA410 targeting the US utilities sector. Two malware families are covered - LookBack and FlowCloud. LookBack was initially seen in July 2019 phishing campaigns spoofing engineering licensing boards. FlowCloud was seen in parallel campaigns starting July 2019 also targeting utility providers. Both are sophisticated remote access trojans (RATs) providing complete system control. Analysis shows LookBack and FlowCloud share macro code, installation techniques, infrastructure, and targeting indicating they originate from TA410. Overlaps with publicly reported tactics of TA429 (APT10) are noted but may be false flag activity. Campaigns switch between PE attachments and macro-enabled Office docs for delivery. Macros fetch payloads from command and control servers which deploy modular RATs and scripts culminating in silent installation of the malware. LookBack and FlowCloud have complex, extensible code bases suggesting development over years. FlowCloud shows potential early targeting in Asia. After establishing access, goals include reconnaissance, lateral movement, and data theft. Protection requires updated detection, monitoring for overlaps with reported tactics, user education on phishing, and reviewing cloud storage permissions. TA410 has demonstrated persistence and innovation in targeting US critical infrastructure.
