The document provides an in-depth analysis of an advanced cyberespionage platform called ProjectSauron that has been active since at least 2011. ProjectSauron targets government, military, research, telecoms, and finance organizations in Russia, Iran, and Rwanda to steal confidential data. The malware uses a customized LUA scripting engine and virtual file system to implement its modular architecture. Over 50 plugin modules provide capabilities like keylogging, password theft, and exfiltration. The malware runs solely in memory and uses encrypted communications. ProjectSauron can move data from air-gapped networks by hiding data on USB devices in an area invisible to the operating system. It also uses DNS tunneling and direct email connections to stealthily exfiltrate data. The malware files are uniquely customized for each target network to avoid reuse of indicators. Infrastructure like domains and servers are never reused either. This shows how ProjectSauron learned from past advanced threats to avoid mistakes and remain hidden. Attribution is difficult, but language analysis suggests English fluent developers with some Unix skills. Italian keywords in configuration suggest a possible Italian nexus. In summary, ProjectSauron is an extremely sophisticated and stealthy threat showing careful study of other advanced actors. It exemplifies the challenges defenders face against mature, flexible adversaries.
