The report details the activities of a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor group referred to as the Winnti umbrella. Winnti is linked to various other Chinese threat groups that have been publicly reported on over the past decade, including APT17, BARIUM, LEAD, and PassCV. The report assesses that these groups operate under the Chinese intelligence apparatus, likely with varying levels of expertise, to achieve political and economic espionage objectives. The Winnti umbrella's initial targets are commonly software and gaming organizations, with the goal of stealing code signing certificates to sign malware for attacks on higher-profile targets. Secondary goals appear to be financial gain through virtual currency manipulation. Later stage targets are often political dissidents, journalists, and technology companies. The report provides technical details on the Winnti umbrella's tactics, including spearphishing, use of custom and public malware, leveraging victims as proxies, and heavy use of TLS encryption. Infrastructure analysis links together various campaigns over the past decade and reveals OPSEC mistakes that point to Beijing origins. In summary, the report exposes the links between Chinese state-sponsored groups, details ongoing attack campaigns, assesses Chinese intelligence operations have become more automated and efficient, and shares recommendations to thwart this persistent threat actor.
