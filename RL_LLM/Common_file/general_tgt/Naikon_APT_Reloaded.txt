The PDF provides an analysis of cyberespionage campaigns attributed to a Chinese-linked threat actor group called Naikon APT. The group has been active for over a decade targeting government entities in the Asia-Pacific region. The report profiles the group's latest campaigns starting in 2017 which leverage new custom malware called Aria-body for command and control after initial infection. Aria-body has remote access trojan capabilities like keylogging, screenshots, file exfiltration etc. Naikon uses phishing emails with weaponized Office documents or archive files exploiting DLL hijacking techniques to infect victims and establish persistence. The group heavily obfuscates its activities by hosting infrastructure across compromised servers and frequently changing domains. By tracking Aria-body malware development and infrastructure reuse, the analysis connects these new Naikon operations to previous campaigns reported on in 2015. Similarity in victim targeting, code reuse, and overlapping infrastructure links Aria-body to Naikon's older remote access trojan called XsFunction. The report concludes Naikon has continued to actively conduct cyberespionage against Asian governments undeterred over many years by using new backdoors, malware delivery tactics, and infrastructure to avoid detection. In summary, the analysis profiles the tools, infrastructure, and techniques used by Chinese threat actor group Naikon APT to conduct long-running cyberespionage campaigns against government entities in Asia.
