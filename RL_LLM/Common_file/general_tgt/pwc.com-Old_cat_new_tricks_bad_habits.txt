The cybersecurity company PwC analyzed recent activity by the Iranian state-sponsored threat actor group Yellow Garuda, also known as Charming Kitten or PHOSPHORUS. In late 2021, PwC found an open server containing tools and victim data related to Yellow Garuda operations. This included a Telegram "grabber" tool used to exfiltrate messages, media, contacts, and other data from targeted Telegram accounts. The tool was likely used in domestic surveillance, as the compromised accounts contained Iranian phone numbers and Farsi language content. PwC also found a surveillance report on one victim written by a Yellow Garuda operator using the alias "ll_invisible_ll." The report gave insights into the group's intelligence gathering process and showed they use numerical identifiers like "2000" and "2300" to denote operators or teams. Additionally, PwC observed Yellow Garuda using macro-enabled Microsoft Word documents to distribute malware in early 2022. This represents a new technique not previously associated with the group. The macros remotely download next-stage payloads hosted on services like OneDrive. The report highlights Yellow Garuda's continued development of new tools, while also making OPSEC errors that expose their activities. PwC notes the group will likely remain one of the most persistent Iranian APTs given its over 10 years of operations focused on surveillance and credential harvesting.
