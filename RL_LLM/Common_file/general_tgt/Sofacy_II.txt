This tactical intelligence bulletin from PwC provides an update on cyberattack activity attributed to a threat actor group known as Sofacy. Sofacy is also referred to by other names like APT28, Fancy Bear, and Sednit. The bulletin references recent reports from security firms Trend Micro and FireEye about spear phishing campaigns and exploits used by Sofacy to target organizations. The phishing emails contained links to malicious websites that installed malware through browser exploits. Interestingly, despite using zero-day exploits for delivery, some of the malware variants were old versions that had been previously observed. PwC notes they have seen Sofacy employ some novel techniques as well, described in a prior bulletin from March 2015. The bulletin contains IOCs in the form of network indicators, specifically a list of domains linked to Sofacy phishing and malware command and control infrastructure. Many of the domains impersonate military, government, and news entities. In summary, this bulletin provides an update on ongoing activity attributed to the Sofacy threat actor group. It reveals continued phishing, use of exploits, and malware activity, with ties to previously identified Sofacy infrastructure. The IOCs can help organizations detect potential Sofacy cyberattacks.
