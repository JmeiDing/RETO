The PDF describes research by Volexity into a sophisticated cyberattack campaign targeting organizations of interest to Chinese threat actors. The attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Sophos firewall devices to gain initial access. Volexity detected the intrusion through anomaly detection and forensic investigation of the compromised firewall. The attackers had installed a malicious Java class file to create a backdoor on the firewall's web interface. This provided persistent access using the publicly available BEHINDER webshell framework. The attackers then performed man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept credentials and cookies for externally hosted websites belonging to the victim organization. They leveraged the stolen cookies to remotely access the website's admin console and install PHP webshells for further access. Web server compromise was used to install backdoors like PupyRAT, Pantegana, and Sliver. Privilege escalation attempts were also observed. The campaign exhibits sophistication through exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability, custom webshells, and operational security measures. Volexity attributes the activity to a Chinese threat actor group they track as DriftingCloud based on TTPs. The incident highlights risks of gateway device compromise and need for network monitoring to detect advanced persistent threat activity. Recommendations are provided for detection and prevention of similar attacks. In summary, the report analyzes an advanced cyberespionage campaign that combined a firewall zero-day exploit with strategic web server compromises to gain access and persist within a targeted organization's network.
