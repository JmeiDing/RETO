The document analyzes potential Russian cyber attacks and infiltration against energy sector and industrial control systems, particularly focused on the oil and gas industry. It examines three cases - BlackEnergy, Dragonfly, and Delta Elektronics - and their connections to Russian state-sponsored cyber operations. BlackEnergy is malware used against Ukraine's power grid in 2015-2016. The attacks involved lengthy reconnaissance, custom malware development, phishing emails to gain access, lateral movement to identify targets, scheduling disruptions, and data destruction. The coordinated attack cut power to 225,000 customers. Dragonfly is a cyber espionage campaign mainly targeting the energy sector. It used Trojanized software updates to compromise industrial control system equipment providers and gain persistence. While its focus was espionage, it had capabilities for potential sabotage. Delta Elektronics poses as an electronics company but exhibits various suspicious behaviors like website duplication and domain registration details linking it to Russian cybercrime. It may manufacture programmable logic controllers trojanized with malware for supply chain attacks against industrial controls. While attribution is not definitive, the analysis concludes there is a high probability of Russian state sponsorship and intent to infiltrate energy sector systems for potential sabotage operations. The use of fronts and complex malware shows sophistication and advanced capabilities. The report emphasizes the need for increased vigilance and security around industrial control systems.
