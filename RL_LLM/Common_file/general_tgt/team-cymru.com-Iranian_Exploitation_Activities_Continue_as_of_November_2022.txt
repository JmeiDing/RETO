The document provides an update on ongoing tracking of Iranian threat actor groups by Team Cymru. The group PHOSPHORUS is known to target organizations in various sectors leveraging vulnerabilities like Log4J and ProxyShell. Previous reporting tied activity to an IP address 107.173.231.114 used for command and control. Recent passive DNS data shows domains associated with that IP getting re-registered, suggesting ongoing activity. An alert in September highlighted the IP and domains as IOCs. Analysis of network telemetry shows 107.173.231.114 communicating with a victim system in South Asia, likely due to an unpatched Microsoft Exchange server. The traffic indicates the malware uses hardcoded IPs rather than domains for command and control. The victim system also connected to IPs associated with Kaspersky and Cloudflare, mirroring behavior seen in previous PHOSPHORUS malware samples. Potential victims in Africa and the Middle East showed similar connections. The findings suggest Iranian exploitation infrastructure remains active and ongoing as of November 2022, utilizing known vulnerabilities against unpatched systems and IP addresses previously identified. Continued monitoring and awareness of associated IOCs is recommended.
