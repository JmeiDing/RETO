The document analyzes the SUNBURST backdoor used in the supply chain attack against SolarWinds Orion software. The backdoor was deployed by threat actor UNC2452 to compromise multiple victims globally. It was distributed through trojanized SolarWinds software updates signed from March-May 2020. After an initial dormant period, the backdoor retrieves jobs to gather system info, transfer files, and execute commands. The backdoor blends in with legitimate SolarWinds traffic by masquerading as the Orion Improvement Program. It uses evasion techniques like process and AV scanning blocklists, encoded C2 communications mimicking XML, subdomain DGAs, and clearing artifacts. Post-compromise activity shows lateral movement using separate credentials per system and temporary file/task manipulation. The highly evasive attack affected public and private sector victims worldwide across various industries. Immediate mitigation steps include isolating and upgrading affected SolarWinds systems, restricting connectivity/privileges, and changing passwords. FireEye is providing detections on GitHub to identify this activity, which leverages multiple techniques for stealthy persistence, credential theft, and data exfiltration.
