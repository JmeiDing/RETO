The PDF describes recent activity by the Gamaredon APT group, an active threat actor since 2013 that primarily targets Ukrainian institutions. ESET researchers analyzed new tools used by Gamaredon for spreading malware and exfiltrating data from compromised systems. These include a custom Outlook macro for sending malicious emails to victim contacts, and modules to inject malicious macros or remote templates into existing Office documents. The Outlook macro module builds emails with attachments like malicious Word docs, sending them to all contacts. This spreads the infection but has also likely compromised systems not normally targeted by Gamaredon. The macro/template injectors search for Office docs on local drives to insert malicious code enabling future compromise. This provides persistence and lateral movement. Other new backdoors, downloaders, and data exfiltration modules were observed, showing rapid evolution of tactics. But coding errors indicate a lack of stringent testing before deploying tools. Infrastructure analysis uncovered domains and IP addresses used for C&C servers. The group constantly changes domains but uses a limited set of hosting providers. The variety of simple but quickly evolving tools makes analysis and remediation difficult. It may also lay the groundwork for more advanced malware deployment in targeted networks down the road.
