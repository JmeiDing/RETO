The report analyzes campaigns by the threat actor BISMUTH that leverage coin mining techniques to fly under the radar while conducting cyberespionage. BISMUTH sent spearphishing emails to carefully chosen targets in Vietnam and France. The emails contained documents that installed malware via DLL sideloading. Once inside the network, BISMUTH spent time gathering intelligence and moving laterally and uses the Word 2007 process to run malicious scripts and scan multiple common ports before installing Monero coin miners. The group also dumped credentials with Mimikatz and exfiltrated data over command and control channels. The coin miners provided cover for BISMUTH's stealthy activities. The attacks blended in threats like phishing and coin mining that defenders may perceive as low priority. But BISMUTH paired these common tactics with sophisticated malware like KerrDown and PowerShell tools. The report highlights how even basic intrusions should be investigated as potential footholds for skilled adversaries. To detect similar blended attacks, organizations should reduce attack surface, limit privilege escalation, monitor for suspicious activities, and leverage AI-powered threat detection. By revealing BISMUTH's techniques, the analysis aims to raise awareness and support security teams defending against this persistent actor.
