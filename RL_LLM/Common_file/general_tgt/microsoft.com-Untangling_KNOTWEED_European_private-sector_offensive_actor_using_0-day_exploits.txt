The PDF describes activity by a European private sector offensive actor named KNOTWEED, linked to the Austria-based company DSIRF. KNOTWEED has used multiple Windows and Adobe 0-days like CVE-2022-22047 to deploy malware called Subzero against European and Central American victims. After initial access via exploits or malicious Office docs, a downloader retrieves encrypted core malware that performs keylogging, screenshots, exfiltration, and more. The main payload Corelump resides in memory only, hijacks legitimate DLLs, and uses a loader called Jumplump for persistence via COM hijacking. Custom tools Mex and PassLib have red team capabilities copied from GitHub. Infrastructure links KNOTWEED to DSIRF domains and servers. Post-compromise actions include dumping credentials, spreading laterally, and accessing emails. KNOTWEED appears to provide Subzero to clients but also conduct operations. Specific IOCs, detections, hunting queries, and mitigations are provided. Customers are advised to patch CVE-2022-22047 and enable security monitoring to detect this activity.
