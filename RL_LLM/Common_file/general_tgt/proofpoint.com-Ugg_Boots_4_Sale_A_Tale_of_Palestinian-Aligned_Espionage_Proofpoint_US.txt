The cybersecurity company Proofpoint has identified new campaigns attributed to the threat actor TA402, also known as Molerats, a group believed to be aligned with Palestinian interests. TA402 is targeting Middle Eastern governments, think tanks, and airlines using phishing emails containing links that lead to malware. The emails contain links that use redirects and geofencing techniques to evade detection. If the target's IP is in the Middle East region, they are redirected to download a RAR file containing a new TA402 malware called NimbleMamba. If outside the target region, they are redirected to a benign news website. NimbleMamba appears to be an updated replacement for TA402's previous LastConn malware. It uses the Dropbox API for command and control and exfiltration. It contains capabilities for taking screenshots, getting system info, detecting user interaction, and more. The malware uses multiple techniques to ensure infections only occur on targeted systems, like IP geolocation and checking for Arabic language packs. The configuration is pulled from paste sites. An additional trojan called BrittleBush is also delivered. TA402 has continuously demonstrated its ability to modify its implants, attack chains, infrastructure, and delivery techniques to evade detection. Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that TA402 will continue updating their operations. The campaigns demonstrate TA402 remains a persistent threat actor focused on targets in the Middle East, likely operating in the interests of Palestinian territories.
