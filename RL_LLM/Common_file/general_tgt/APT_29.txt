The PDF analyzes a spearphishing campaign from November 2018 targeting multiple industries that delivers Cobalt Strike malware. Technical details connect the activity to APT29, a sophisticated threat actor known for cyber espionage. The emails posed as the U.S. Department of State sharing documents and contained links to download ZIP archives. The ZIP archives held weaponized shortcut files that used PowerShell to execute Cobalt Strike beacons customized to blend in with normal traffic. Several technical artifacts, tactics, and targeting details overlap with previous APT29 campaigns. This includes specific metadata in the weaponized shortcuts matching those used by APT29 in 2016. The threat actor also demonstrated patience in setting up infrastructure a month in advance. The embedded Cobalt Strike profile was modified from a public version, likely to avoid detections reliant on default configurations. The targeting of similar sectors and some of the same individuals as past APT29 campaigns further connects this new activity to the group. While attribution is not definitive, the technical breadcrumbs and tradecraft of this spearphishing campaign are consistent with APT29's sophisticated capabilities. The report highlights the need for continued vigilance and investigation even when threats emulate prior activity, as subtle changes may signal updated adversary tactics.
