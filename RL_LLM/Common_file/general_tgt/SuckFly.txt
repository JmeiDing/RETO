The document analyzes the activities of Suckfly, a China-based advanced persistent threat (APT) group that has been conducting cyberespionage campaigns since 2014. Suckfly steals code signing certificates from organizations in South Korea and uses them to sign its custom malware and hacking tools. This technique disguises the malware as legitimate files and allows it to bypass security defenses. The investigation reveals Suckfly stole 9 certificates from software/game developers located in Seoul starting in early 2014. The certificates were used to sign at least 13 unique malware samples including the Nidiran backdoor for targeted attacks. Suckfly infects victims via strategic web compromises delivering exploits for Microsoft Windows. Signed malware is increasingly common as attackers piggyback on the reputation of stolen certificates. The report emphasizes the importance of safeguarding certificates to prevent misuse. It advises using encryption, extended validation certificates, and secure code signing services to add security layers. The timeline of stolen certificate use shows Suckfly's persistence in gathering certificates for campaigns originating from China against government and commercial targets globally. In summary, the analysis of Suckfly exposes the secret misuse of code signing certificates and the importance of protecting them from theft by sophisticated attackers like this APT group. Stolen certificates allow malware to disguise itself and bypass defenses.
