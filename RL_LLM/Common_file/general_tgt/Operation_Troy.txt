The document analyzes an cyberespionage operation called Operation Troy that targeted South Korea from 2009-2013. The operation involved various malware tools and tactics to infiltrate South Korean military and government networks to steal classified information. It started with a watering hole attack in 2009 that exploited a military social networking site. Later attacks likely involved spear-phishing. The malware used included remote access Trojans (RATs) like NSTAR, HTTP Troy, Tong, and TDrop which connected to command and control servers via encrypted IRC channels. The RATs scanned infected systems for interesting files and military keywords. Directory listings were sent to the C&C servers so attackers could selectively steal files. The RATs had wiper components that could destroy systems by wiping the MBR, as seen in the Dark Seoul incident in 2013. The various RAT versions reused code and components like bs.dll and payload.dll over the years, confirming the same group's involvement. Encryption, IRC nicknames, directory paths, and other tactics were consistent across the malware versions from 2009-2013. The campaign targeted military networks to gather intelligence. The stolen data was exfiltrated over an encrypted network. Two groups claimed responsibility - NewRomanic Cyber Army Team and Whois Hacking Team - but they appear to be a fabrication to hide the real threat actor. In summary, Operation Troy was a long-running cyberespionage campaign that relied on malware and encryption to infiltrate and steal military secrets from South Korea likely for strategic purposes.
