The PDF describes analysis of a recent malware campaign dubbed "Roma225" targeting companies in the Italian automotive industry. The key points are: - The malware was distributed via phishing emails impersonating a Brazilian law firm. The emails contained a PowerPoint add-in file that downloaded the malware payload. - The payload installs the RevengeRAT on the victim machine, which contacts two command and control servers located in Canada and Brazil. - RevengeRAT is commercially available malware that can be customized. The "roma225" variant exfiltrates system info and awaits further commands from the attacker. - A secondary payload dubbed "Outlook.exe" is also downloaded. It binds to a local port but its purpose is still being analyzed. - There are indications the attack may originate from an Italian threat actor based on Italian references in the malware code. However, attribution is inconclusive. - The malware shows some similarities to attacks by an APT group called Gorgon Group. However RevengeRAT is widely used by multiple actors. In summary, the Roma225 campaign leverages a customized variant of RevengeRAT to target companies in the Italian automotive industry, but the threat actor behind it remains ambiguous at this time.
