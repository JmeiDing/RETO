The post analyzes a yearlong cyber attack campaign called LeetMX originating from Mexico and targeting organizations in Latin America. The attackers use spear phishing emails with malicious Office documents to infect targets with remote access trojans and keyloggers. Over 550 malware samples were observed, with most being variants of the Xtreme RAT. The infrastructure involves 27 domains and hosts used for malware delivery and command and control. The campaign has been active since at least November 2016. The likely motivation is financial, though the exact objectives are uncertain. Targets include organizations in Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Argentina, and Costa Rica. Technical details reveal the malicious documents contain macros that execute PowerShell scripts to download payloads from the attacker domains. The post highlights targeting examples, malware code snippets, and decoded malware filenames. Origins in Mexico are indicated through IP addresses, Whois registrant info, redirects to a Mexican newspaper, and targets. The attackers use leetspeak in the malware filenames. The post concludes with indicators of compromise and a Maltego graph of the key infrastructure. Defenders are advised to monitor for the associated domains, IPs, and attack behaviors.
