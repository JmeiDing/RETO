The PDF discusses the web shell malware China Chopper, which has been active for over 9 years. China Chopper allows attackers remote access and control of compromised systems. The malware is simple and widely available, making attribution difficult. The PDF analyzes 3 different campaigns exploiting China Chopper: 1. An espionage campaign targeting an Asian government organization to exfiltrate documents and database information. The attackers used commands with WinRAR for compression and passwords, PowerShell scripts for database dumps, and drive mapping for exfiltration. 2. A campaign compromising a public website in Lebanon, used by multiple actors to deploy ransomware, install a cryptocurrency miner, and collect credentials via Mimikatz and other tools. 3. A campaign targeting an Asian web hosting provider over 10 months. The actors sought to create admin users, dump credentials via Mimikatz, exploit Windows vulnerabilities for privilege escalation, modify ACLs, and possibly deface websites. The PDF concludes that despite its age, China Chopper remains simple and effective for attackers with varying goals. Defenders should hunt proactively for breaches, keep software updated, and use protections like IPS, sandboxing, and endpoint detection to mitigate China Chopper campaigns.
