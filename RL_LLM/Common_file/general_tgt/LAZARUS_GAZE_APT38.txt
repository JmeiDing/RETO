The document analyzes a recent spear-phishing campaign attributed to the Lazarus cybercrime group targeting financial, research, and defense sectors globally. The attack starts with weaponized job opportunity-themed Word documents containing malicious macros. The macros drop and execute a DLL payload that gathers system info and beacons to a command and control server. The C2 script handles victim communications, limiting second-stage malware distribution via blacklists and whitelists. Second-stage backdoors are selectively delivered to victims of interest. The backend infrastructure shows efforts to manage victims and curtail uncontrolled spreading. Targeting focuses on India but spans other regions including Italy. The campaign demonstrates Lazarus' ongoing innovation in initial compromise vectors and backend victim management. The selective targeting aims to maintain access to high-value institutions for potential data theft, funds theft, or sabotage aligned with North Korean interests. Defensive recommendations include implementing provided IOCs, YARA rules, and mitigations.
