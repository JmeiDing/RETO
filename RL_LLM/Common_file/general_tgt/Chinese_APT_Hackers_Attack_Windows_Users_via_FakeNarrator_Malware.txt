The PDF describes a malware campaign by Chinese APT hackers targeting technology companies in Southeast Asia. The attackers are using a trojanized version of the Windows Narrator screen reader application called FakeNarrator to gain SYSTEM privileges on compromised machines. The malware is designed to implant a modified version of the open-source PcShare backdoor. Threat actors use legitimate NVIDIA applications to load the malware on victims' machines. The FakeNarrator malware abuses Microsoft accessibility features to bypass the login screen and execute malware as SYSTEM. It replaces the legitimate Windows Narrator and is enabled via Ease of Access settings. ttackers gain full control of the targeted system and remote desktop access without any credentials. After gaining high privileges, the attackers deploy a customized version of the PcShare open source backdoor. PcShare allows remote control of the system for functions like file management, process killing, service manipulation, and running executables. The malware uses sandbox evasion and encrypted C2 communications. It has similarities to the Tropic Trooper backdoor used in attacks on Taiwan and the Philippines. The campaign demonstrates stealth techniques like DLL side-loading and memory injection to avoid detection. The goal appears to be long-term remote access to compromised systems. Defenders should update software, secure accessibility features, monitor for suspicious child processes of system binaries, and inspect memory and traffic for signs of malware. Sharing threat intelligence can help identify new malware families like FakeNarrator faster.
