Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF: The PDF describes an investigation by Elastic Security into a malware campaign targeting the financial sector in Vietnam. The malware is called PHOREAL/RIZZO, which is a backdoor that allows attackers to gain initial access and conduct further exploitation of victim networks. Elastic detected anomalous activity on a Windows endpoint, where the control.exe process was loading an unsigned DLL called tscon32.dll. Further analysis showed this DLL contained the PHOREAL malware, which has been attributed to the threat actor group APT32 (also known as OceanLotus). APT32 has been active since 2014, targeting organizations in Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam. PHOREAL appears to be used early in an intrusion to establish a foothold in the victim network. The malware contains an encrypted C2 domain which resolves to an IP address hosted by a company in Hong Kong. Elastic developed YARA rules to detect PHOREAL and enable collection of the malicious threads from memory. Recommendations include enabling memory protection capabilities in Elastic Agents, deploying the YARA rules, and blocking identified IOCs. In summary, this documents an incident where the PHOREAL backdoor linked to APT32 was detected being loaded into the control.exe process on a system in the Vietnamese financial sector. Analysis by Elastic Security provides technical details on the malware and recommendations for detection and response.
