The PDF describes research done by Check Point on a recently discovered threat group called Nazar. Nazar was found in the last Shadow Brokers leak in the NSA's Territorial Dispute (TeDi) tool, which had signatures to detect other threat groups. Nazar is believed to have been active around 2008-2012. The main components are an initial downloader gpUpdates.exe, the main RAT svchost.exe, and supporting modules like Godown.dll for shutdown and Filesystem.dll for file enumeration. GpUpdates drops and executes Distribute.exe which installs the RAT and supporting modules. Svchost.exe sniffs packets for UDP on port 1234 and processes commands from the C2 server sent in the UDP payload. It supports commands for keylogging, screenshots, microphone recording and more. The C2 protocol is unique in using the Naver email platform to exfiltrate data and receive commands by sending attachments. However Naver locked the account due to suspicious logins. The modules appear to rely heavily on open source code. While the malware is unsophisticated, the C2 protocol blends in with legitimate traffic. The victimology focusing on Korea also matches previous campaigns attributed to Group123 by Talos. However, definitive attribution remains unclear. The research provides indicators of compromise, Yara rules, a script to simulate the C2 protocol, and notes there may be more undiscovered samples. It shows that even simple malware can remain undetected for years, but leaked NSA tools continue to unravel hidden threat groups.
