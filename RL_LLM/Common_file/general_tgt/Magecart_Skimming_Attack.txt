The PDF describes a Magecart skimming attack that targeted the mobile users of online booking websites for two major international hotel chains. The attack injected malicious JavaScript code into a third-party JavaScript library used by the booking websites of both hotel chains. The library was provided by a Spanish company called Roomleader that helps hotels build their booking sites. When accessed via mobile browsers, the injected code loaded a credit card skimming script that could steal users' personal and payment information entered on the booking page. The skimmer would send the stolen data to a remote server controlled by the attackers. Further analysis found that the skimmer actually replaced the original credit card payment form on the booking page with a fake one to ensure it could capture full credit card details including CVC numbers. The attackers specifically targeted mobile users likely to avoid detection by desktop security software. The skimmer payload is not new but rather a generic script shared on underground forums. There are no strong connections found to previous known Magecart groups. The report concludes with recommendations for businesses to secure websites and for users to consider additional authentication methods like Apple Pay and Google Pay.
