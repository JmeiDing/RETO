The document analyzes a new backdoor called WarHawk used by the SideWinder APT group in campaigns targeting Pakistan. SideWinder is a suspected Indian threat actor active since 2012. The WarHawk backdoor contains modules for downloading executables, command execution, gathering file info, and uploading from the C2 server. It uses kernel callback table injection, a technique also used by FinFisher and Lazarus APTs, to inject and execute the Cobalt Strike malware. The malware initiates with a phishing ISO file hosted on a compromised Pakistan government website. It uses PDF cybersecurity advisories from Pakistan as decoys. The ISO contains a shortcut to execute the WarHawk backdoor. WarHawk gathers system info and sends it to the C2 server. It can download additional payloads from the C2, including Cobalt Strike beacons. The CS loader has anti-analysis checks and ensures execution only in Pakistan time zone. The report ties the activity to SideWinder through infrastructure reuse, mimicking of Pakistan government domains for C2, and targeting indicators. Zscaler detects the malware via sandboxing and advanced threat signatures. The threat actor continues honing tactics like ISO phishing, kernel injection, and lookalike domains. The blending of APT toolsets highlights SideWinder's growing sophistication.
