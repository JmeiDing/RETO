The report from Proofpoint details a cyberespionage campaign by a threat actor they call TA413 targeting Tibetan organizations globally. The campaign delivers phishing emails with a custom malicious Firefox browser extension named FriarFox. FriarFox is based on an open source tool called Gmail Notifier but has enhanced capabilities and disguises itself as an Adobe Flash update. It gains access to the target's Gmail account to read, send, and forward emails. The browser extension also retrieves a JavaScript-based malware framework called Scanbox from the attacker's server. Scanbox can track web visits, keylog, and steal data for future attacks. Links are established between this campaign and previous activity by TA413, including the use of Royal Road documents and Sepulcher malware to target Tibetan groups. TA413 aligns with Chinese state interests and focuses on surveillance of dissidents. While the malware itself is not highly advanced, the targeting is strategic and combines social engineering with adapted public tools. The report provides analysis of the JavaScript payloads, infrastructure links, delivery tactics, and recommendations for defense.
