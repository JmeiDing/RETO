The document analyzes the activities and tactics of an Iran-based cyber threat group called Chafer. Chafer has been active since at least 2014, conducting surveillance and tracking operations against targets in the Middle East and beyond. In 2017, Chafer expanded its operations, using 7 new tools and compromising 9 additional organizations in the Middle East across various sectors like telecom, airlines, and software. Chafer has evolved its tactics, now using spearphishing emails with malicious Office docs instead of web server attacks. The malware allows initial recon and then downloads further tools like PowerShell downloaders, Mimikatz, and custom backdoors to traverse the victim network. One major target was a large regional telecom provider, which if compromised could enable mass surveillance of end users. Chafer also attempted to hit an international travel reservations firm. New infrastructure like command and control domains and sequential IP addresses were identified. While some links between Chafer and another threat actor called Crambus were found, it's unclear if they are the same group. But they likely have a resource sharing relationship. Chafer remains a highly active and evolving threat for organizations in the Middle East, employing supply chain compromises, living off the land tools, and ambitious targeting. The report provides an in-depth profile of their operations, tools, infrastructure, and attack lifecycle. Protections against their malware and detections for their activities are available. In summary, the document provides a technical analysis of the Iranian Chafer group's activities, tactics, and tools based on their operations in 2017 and evolution since initial discovery.
