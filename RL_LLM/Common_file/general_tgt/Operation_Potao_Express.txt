The report provides an analysis of the Win32/Potao malware family which has been used in cyberespionage campaigns since 2011, primarily targeting Ukraine, Russia, and Georgia. Potao is a modular trojan that can download additional plugins for spying, including keyloggers, password stealers, and system info gathering. It uses encrypted C&C communications. Notable high-value targets include Ukrainian government and military agencies, a major Ukrainian news outlet, and members of a Russian financial pyramid scheme. Initial infection vectors include spear-phishing emails with weaponized Office documents, SMS messages containing links to download the malware, and spreading via USB drives. An interesting discovery was the trojanized Russian version of TrueCrypt encryption software hosted at truecryptrussia.ru. It serves backdoored TrueCrypt to select victims and acts as a Potao C&C server. Technical details are provided on Potao's architecture, anti-analysis techniques, C&C protocol, USB spreading, and more. Similarities to BlackEnergy malware are drawn. IOCs include hashes, domain names, and IP addresses tied to Potao and the trojanized TrueCrypt. The report concludes Potao shows hallmarks of a targeted espionage toolkit, likely of Russian origin.
