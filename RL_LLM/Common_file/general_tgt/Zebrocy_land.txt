The PDF discusses research by ESET on the Sednit cyberespionage group, also known as Zebrocy or APT28. It focuses on analyzing the commands sent by Sednit operators to compromised systems running the Zebrocy Delphi backdoor. - In August 2018, Sednit distributed the Zebrocy malware via spearphishing, directing victims to a URL hosting a malicious executable. This suggests increased reliance on social engineering tactics. - The initial Zebrocy payload gathers system info and runs keylogging and credential dumping tools. Operators manually send commands to further explore the compromised system. - Commands gather additional system and network details, collect files, and deploy new backdoors. Operators are focused on duplicating info from previous stages. - A second Delphi backdoor with tweaked encryption and commands is briefly deployed to some targets. This may be to evade detection. - In general, Zebrocy backdoors are manually controlled, rapidly changing, and finely tuned for specific targets. The group continues honing its tools to effectively infiltrate targets and steal data. - Understanding Zebrocy's commands gives valuable insight into how Sednit operators exploit compromised machines. This highlights the importance of strong defenses to detect and disrupt the group's activities.
