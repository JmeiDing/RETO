The document provides an analysis of Gazer, a sophisticated second stage backdoor used by the Turla APT group for cyberespionage. Gazer utilizes custom encryption and a modular architecture. It is injected into legitimate processes for stealth and leverages compromised websites as C2 proxies. The backdoor spies on victims and exfiltrates data. Links to Turla include similar infrastructure, targets like government/embassies, a first stage dropping Gazer, and code similarities to Carbon and Kazuar. Strings reference the Turla codename MAKERSMARK. Gazer loads modules for keylogging, encryption, system enumeration, stealing browser data, and spreading via removable drives. Log files and config data are encrypted and stored in the registry or alternate streams. The C2 protocol relies on GET for commands and POST of encrypted data. Traffic goes through checks for proxies, user agents, and internet connectivity. The documents cover Gazer components, encryption, communication, log files, and timeline in extensive technical detail. Gazer shows sophistication reflecting nation-state resources. Defenses require detecting delivery vectors, injecting behaviors, encryption, and C2 traffic. IOCs, hashes, and Yara rules are provided for threat hunting.
