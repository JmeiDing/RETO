The document is a report by cybersecurity company Kaspersky detailing the activities of an advanced persistent threat (APT) hacking group called CactusPete, also known as Karma Panda or Tonto Team. CactusPete is a Chinese-speaking group that has been active since at least 2013, targeting organizations in Asia and Eastern Europe, especially those in the military, diplomatic, infrastructure, and technology sectors. In February 2020, Kaspersky observed a new campaign by CactusPete using an updated version of their custom malware called Bisonal. The targets were financial and military organizations in Eastern Europe. The updated Bisonal backdoor version maintains functionality similar to past backdoors built from the same codebase. Analysis of the malware revealed it has information stealing capabilities and is controlled via a hardcoded command and control server address. The malware exfiltrates extensive details about the infected system to the C2. CactusPete typically infects victims via spear phishing emails containing malicious document attachments that exploit vulnerabilities to install malware if opened. Kaspersky suggests network monitoring, keeping software updated, using antivirus, and employee awareness training to defend against such threats. The report also provides an overview of CactusPete's activities since 2013, showing continued campaigns distributing various backdoors like Bisonal, DoubleT, and ShadowPad. Their targets have expanded but remain focused on Asia and Eastern Europe. Though CactusPete does not use highly advanced malware, their success relies on crafting convincing phishing emails to reliably compromise targets of interest. Kaspersky suggests companies need to train employees more effectively against such phishing.
