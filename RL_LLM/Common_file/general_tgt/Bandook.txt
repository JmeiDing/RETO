The document is about a malware named Bandook that is used in a targeted attack. Bandook has a modular architecture and rich feature set including keylogging, screen captures, credential theft etc. It uses a loader written in Delphi and payload injected into Internet Explorer. It consists of three stages: Lure Documents, PowerShell Loader, and the Bandook Loader. The first stage starts with a Microsoft Word document containing malicious script data and an external template. The second stage decodes and executes a base64 encoded PowerShell stored in the second dropped file. The third stage is the final payload, which is a variant of an old full-featured RAT named Bandook. The malware uses the Process Hollowing technique to create a new instance of an Internet Explorer process and inject a malicious payload into it. The payload contacts the C&C server, sends basic information about the infected machine, and waits for additional commands from the server. The variants of the Bandook malware share similar methods of communication and incorporate commands that are not available in any other public leak or report. The authors believe that the same attacker who operated during the Dark Caracal operation is behind this malware infrastructure and is still active and willing to assist in cyber operations.
