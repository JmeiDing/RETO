The document analyzes a new multi-platform malware framework called MATA that targets Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. MATA has been used since around April 2018 to compromise corporate entities globally. The Windows version uses a loader malware to decrypt and load orchestrator malware, which can then load up to 15 plugins dynamically. The plugins provide various functions like command execution, file manipulation, process control, and traffic forwarding. The Linux version runs as a daemon and stores encrypted configs similar to Windows. It has plugins for command execution, file operations, process control, and traffic forwarding like the Windows version. The macOS version masquerades as a legitimate two-factor authentication app. It drops and executes a Mach-O binary that functions similar to the Linux variant. Attribution suggests ties to the Lazarus APT group based on unique filenames only seen previously in Lazarus malware. MATA has targeted software companies, e-commerce firms, and an ISP. After compromising victims, it was used to steal databases and distribute ransomware. MATA is assessed to be an advanced, modular framework that will continue to evolve and poses a dangerous threat due to its multi-platform targeting capabilities.
