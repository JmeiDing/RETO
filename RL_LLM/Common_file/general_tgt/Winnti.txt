The document discusses recent infrastructure and malware samples attributed to a Chinese threat actor group called Winnti. In July 2017, ClearSky security researchers detected a malicious RTF document exploiting CVE-2017-0199. This document downloaded a VBS script that retrieved additional malware, with one sample communicating with a command and control server backup.aolonline[.]cc. By pivoting on IP addresses, code signing certificates, and domain registration details, ClearSky connected this activity to previous campaigns associated with Winnti. Winnti primarily targets the gaming industry, with most of their tools detected by Proofpoint as relating to "Casper aka LEAD." The PDF contains indicators of compromise including domain names, IP addresses, email addresses, file hashes, and network hosts related to Winnti infrastructure. Many of these indicators link back to activity observed as early as 2015. ClearSky notes that Winnti continues to actively use this infrastructure to distribute exploits and malware to victim organizations. In summary, the document provides an overview of how researchers uncovered a new campaign by the Winnti group, as well as extensive IOCs that can be used by security teams to detect this threat actor's ongoing operations. The data illustrates Winnti's persistence and sophistication in leveraging malware and exploits to compromise targets in the gaming vertical.
