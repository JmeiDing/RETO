The document analyzes a recent cyberespionage campaign by the threat group Gamaredon, which has been active since 2014 and is attributed to the Russian FSB. Gamaredon targets the Ukrainian government and military with spearphishing emails containing weaponized Office documents. The malware used is Pteranodon, also called Pterodo, a multi-stage backdoor designed to collect sensitive information and maintain access on compromised machines. The initial document exploit drops a .dot template file which executes a VBS script to maintain persistence and fetch the next stage payload. The next payload is a series of SFX archives containing batch scripts, VBScripts, and a .NET executable. The macros harvest system info to build unique URLs to retrieve further payloads from the command and control server. The .NET module contains the core backdoor functionality for exfiltrating data. Analysis reveals the techniques used are similar to past Gamaredon campaigns - Office docs, SFX, macros, etc. The key difference is the introduction of a .NET backdoor component which is a new addition. The report concludes Gamaredon operations are ongoing with recent intensification against Ukrainian military. IOCs, Yara rules, C2s, and payloads are provided to detect this new wave of attacks by the persistent and adaptive threat group.
