In December 2021, Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered a new tool named HYPERSCRAPE used by the Iranian government-backed group Charming Kitten to steal user data from Gmail, Yahoo!, and Microsoft Outlook accounts. The attacker runs the tool on their own machine after acquiring a target's credentials through phishing or account hijacking. It spoofs the user agent to look like an outdated browser, enabling basic HTML view in Gmail. Once logged in, the tool changes the account's language settings to English, iterates through the contents of the mailbox, downloads messages as .eml files, marks them as unread, and deletes any security emails from Google. When conducting a Takeout, the program spawns a new copy of itself and initializes a pipe communication channel to relay cookies and account name required for Takeout. The functionality was not automated, and it's unclear why it was removed in later versions. TAG is committed to sharing research with the security community to raise awareness about bad actors like Charming Kitten and improve understanding of tactics and techniques that enhance threat hunting capabilities and lead to stronger protection across the industry.
