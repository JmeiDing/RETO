Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF: The PDF describes analysis of a new macOS malware called OSX_DOK or OSX_DOK.C by security researchers at Trend Micro. This malware is linked to an ongoing cyberespionage campaign called Operation Emmental which has been active since at least 2014. OSX_DOK is distributed via phishing emails containing malicious .zip and .docx attachments. If opened, it initially shows a fake OSX software update screen to gain admin access. It then installs malicious certficates to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on the victim's internet traffic. The malware specifically targets banking and financial sites in Switzerland. It hijacks connections to these sites, redirecting users to fake login pages controlled by the attackers to steal account credentials and other sensitive data. Researchers discovered OSX_DOK is very similar in behavior to a Windows malware called WERDLOD or Retefe which was also used in Operation Emmental. Both kill browsers, install fake certificates, use tor/proxies, and share the same target list. This suggests OSX_DOK is the macOS version of the same cyberespionage toolkit. Operation Emmental has been active since at least 2014, targeting banks, governments, and corporations in various countries. The addition of macOS malware to their toolkit suggests the attackers are expanding their operations. Trend Micro recommends users be wary of unsolicited email attachments, use comprehensive security software, and enterprise solutions with cross-platform protection to detect threats like OSX_DOK that can steal sensitive data. In summary, the report provides analysis of a new macOS malware linked to an evolving, sophisticated cyberespionage campaign operation for nearly 3 years.
