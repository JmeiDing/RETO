The document analyzes targeted attacks against Japanese companies by a threat actor using two forms of ransomware - ONI and a newly discovered MBR-ONI. Attacks lasted 3-9 months. Initial access via phishing emails with weaponized Office docs dropping Ammyy Admin RAT. Attackers then moved laterally, compromised critical assets like domain controllers to gain full control of networks. In final stage, they pushed scripts via group policy to wipe logs and distribute ONI ransomware across organizations. MBR-ONI bootkit ransomware seen only on a few critical assets like AD servers, not endpoints. Based on DiskCryptor code. Researchers suspect ONI and MBR-ONI used intentionally as wipers to cover up attacks rather than for ransom. Points such as inconsistent ID use between versions, targeting of critical assets with MBR-ONI, and extensive log wiping support wiper theory. Attacks show concerning global trend of ransomware and wipers used for targeted attacks by cybercriminals and nation-states.
