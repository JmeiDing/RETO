The report analyzes the activities of a threat actor group called "Tick" that has conducted cyber espionage campaigns against organizations in South Korea and Japan for several years. Tick targets companies with intellectual property or sensitive data, particularly in defense and technology. Tick uses custom malware like Daserf, as well as more common remote access trojans like Gh0st RAT. They exploit vulnerabilities and use social engineering techniques in spearphishing emails. Tick previously used domain registration services to hide infrastructure but has shifted to compromising websites for command and control. The report provides technical analysis of several Tick tools including Daserf, Invader, 9002 RAT, Minzen, NamelessHdoor, and a custom Gh0st RAT variant. It examines the code similarities and infrastructure links between these tools, attributing them to the same developer linked to Tick. A spearphishing email delivers a downloader called HomamDownloader, using social engineering tricks tailored to Japanese business practices around encrypted email attachments. This shows Tick's understanding of targets' behavior. Tick has repeatedly targeted a high-profile organization in Japan over three years. The report concludes Tick is running persistent, stealthy attacks against South Korean and Japanese targets, likely with capabilities that remain undiscovered. It provides indicators of compromise and notes how Palo Alto Networks products detect Tick's activities.
