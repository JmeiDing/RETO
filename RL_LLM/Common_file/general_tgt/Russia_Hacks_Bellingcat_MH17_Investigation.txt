The report details cyber attacks by Russian threat actors against Bellingcat, an investigative journalism group that has published extensively on the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) over Ukraine in 2014. Bellingcat was targeted by spearphishing campaigns attributed to FANCY BEAR, a Russian advanced persistent threat group, from 2015-2016. The phishing emails spoofed Gmail security notifications and used shortened URLs to harvest credentials from Bellingcat researchers. In February 2016, the pro-Russian hacktivist group CyberBerkut compromised Bellingcat contributor Ruslan Leviev's email and accounts, defaced the Bellingcat website, and leaked his personal information. Leviev believes his SMS-based two-factor authentication was intercepted to access his Yandex email account. The report examines potential connections between FANCY BEAR and CyberBerkut based on similarities in infrastructure and targeting. Overlaps were found between documents leaked by CyberBerkut and the site DCLeaks, which has links to FANCY BEAR. The attacks are seen as retaliation for Bellingcat's reporting on the MH17 investigation implicating Russia. The report stresses that organizations publishing negative content about Russia can expect cyber operations intended to intimidate, influence or retaliate against them. It advises enabling two-factor authentication as a defense.
