The PDF describes a malware campaign uncovered by eSentire where business professionals searching Google for free templates like invoices or questionnaires are redirected to hacker-controlled sites on Google Sites. Over 100,000 malicious pages have been created containing business keywords. When users click to download the templates, they are redirected to sites that deliver a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) disguised as a PDF. The SolarMarker RAT and a Slim PDF reader are installed as decoys. SolarMarker is also known as Jupyter, Yellow Cockatoo, and Polazert. The campaign relies on search engine optimization and social engineering rather than vulnerabilities. Once installed, the RAT allows threat actors full remote access to compromise the system further. eSentire has seen the group switch tactics from Shopify to Google Sites for hosting malicious pages. The report analyzes the infection process, evolution of tactics, and details of the RAT. It aims to make security teams aware of this campaign threatening professionals searching for free business templates and forms. Defenses should focus on preventing untrusted software installation and monitoring for RAT behavior. In summary, the report exposes an extensive malware campaign targeting professionals seeking templates on Google, using SEO and decoys to infect them with a sophisticated RAT.
