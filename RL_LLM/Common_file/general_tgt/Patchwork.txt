The document discusses a campaign by the threat actor group Patchwork, also known as Dropping Elephant and Monsoon, targeting organizations in the Indian subcontinent region. Patchwork utilized weaponized Microsoft Word documents containing EPS exploits for CVE-2015-2545 and CVE-2017-0261 to distribute updated versions of their BADNEWS malware. Document lures referred to topics of interest to Pakistani military and nuclear agencies. The BADNEWS malware acts as a backdoor providing the attackers full control over infected systems. It leverages public websites to host encrypted command and control information which it decrypts. The malware can download/execute files, take screenshots, log keystrokes, and exfiltrate documents. Researchers uncovered modifications to how the latest BADNEWS variant decrypts C2 information from compromised public sites acting as "dead drop" resolvers. The malware now uses an additional Base64 encoding and Blowfish algorithm to decode this data. Additional changes were seen in how BADNEWS prepares and sends victim system info to its C2 servers. The C2 commands available have also been updated compared to previous versions. The report concludes Patchwork/Dropping Elephant continues updating their toolsets to compromise targets in the Indian subcontinent. Defenders are advised to block the group's infrastructure, monitor for their tools, and quickly respond to intrusions.
