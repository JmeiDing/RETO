The document discusses a malicious IIS module called SessionManager that has been used to backdoor Microsoft Exchange servers after they were compromised via ProxyLogon vulnerabilities. SessionManager acts as a persistent and stealthy backdoor, allowing attackers to control compromised servers. The backdoor offers several capabilities that make it a lightweight persistent initial access backdoor, including reading, writing to, and deleting arbitrary files on the compromised server, executing arbitrary binaries from the compromised server, establishing connections to arbitrary network endpoints that can be reached by the compromised server, and reading and writing in such connections. SessionManager was developed in C++ and has evolved through several versions since March 2021. It intercepts HTTP requests to run commands, read/write files, execute processes, and make network connections back to its operators. The module has targeted government, military, NGOs, and companies primarily across Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. It is suspected to be operated by the threat actor group Gelsemium, who has links to espionage activities. SessionManager abuses normal HTTP cookie values to pass commands and exfiltrate data. Later versions encrypt this traffic. After deploying it, attackers have used SessionManager to download additional reconnaissance and credential theft tools. Commands are passed from an operator to SessionManager using a specific HTTP cookie name. The answer from the backdoor to an operator will usually be inserted in the body of the server HTTP response. The report details the IOCs of SessionManager and related tools, as well as recommendations for detecting and removing IIS module backdoors. It highlights that Exchange servers compromised since early 2021 require thorough investigation for stealthy threats like SessionManager. Overall, the report sheds light on an overlooked but dangerous IIS backdoor being used for long-term access to violate organizations globally. It serves as a reminder that major vulnerabilities like ProxyLogon have lingering consequences that may take months or years to fully uncover.
