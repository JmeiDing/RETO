In January 2022, the cybersecurity firm Sekoia obtained indicators of compromise related to a new worm spreading through compromised QNAP network devices. Analysis of the sophisticated malware is ongoing, but Sekoia has uncovered: The worm spreads via LNK files that download and install malware from compromised QNAP command and control servers. Over 90 domains used for C2 were registered since September 2021. The infrastructure uses 176 unique IP addresses across consumer routers and QNAP devices. A "mothership" server coordinates the operation's infrastructure. Most compromised devices are in Germany. The MSI installer downloaded by the LNK file contains obfuscated code that exfiltrates system info. It's unknown how QNAP devices across many firmware versions were compromised for command and control. Targeting focuses on Europe, especially Germany. The intent behind the worm remains unclear - cybercrime or espionage? Sekoia is continuing analysis and welcomes additional intel from partners. They have released network IOCs to help identify infections. The sophisticated infrastructure and deceptive tactics indicate a concerning new threat actor actively targeting European organizations.
