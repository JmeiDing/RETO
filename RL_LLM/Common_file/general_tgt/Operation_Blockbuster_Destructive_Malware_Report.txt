This report provides technical analysis on the destructive malware used by the Lazarus Group cybercrime organization. The malware includes both "wipers" designed to destroy data on infected systems, and DDoS bots used to flood target networks with traffic. Several wiper variants were examined including WhiskeyAlfa, WhiskeyBravo, WhiskeyCharlie, and WhiskeyDelta. These use techniques like file overwriting, sector overwriting, and RAW disk access to irrecoverably destroy data on hard drives. Some variants also install backdoors, spread through networks, and report back to command servers. The DDoS bots DeltaAlfa, DeltaBravo, and DeltaCharlie were also analyzed. They generate floods of DNS requests, ICMP pings, UDP and HTTP traffic to overwhelm networks. The bots use encoded C2 communications and some install packet sniffing drivers on infected hosts. The report concludes that while the malware varies in complexity, it is operationally effective at destroying data or denying network access. Even with moderate skills and resources, the Lazarus Group has developed destructive tools that constitute dangerous cyberwarfare capabilities.
