This Malwarebytes report analyzes a new fileless attack called Kraken that abuses the Windows Error Reporting service. The attack starts with a phishing email containing a weaponized Word doc that uses a malicious macro to load and execute a .NET payload called Kraken loader. The Kraken loader injects shellcode into the WerFault.exe process. The shellcode uses several anti-analysis techniques to detect sandboxes and debugging. It then makes an HTTP request to download and execute another payload from a compromised server. Kraken follows an APT-style attack pattern, including spear phishing for initial access, fileless techniques, anti-analysis, compromised infrastructure, and multi-stage modular code. There are loose connections to APT32 based on prior TTPs, but attribution is not definitive. Key technical aspects of Kraken are: - Macro document fetching remote templates to hide embedded exploits - Custom .NET loader for process injection - Shellcode resolving APIs dynamically and launching child threads - Anti-analysis checks for debuggers, VMs, and supported CPU features - Download and execution of a next-stage payload from a strategic web compromise The abuse of Windows Error Reporting for stealthy implant deployment highlights that attackers are continuing to innovate techniques and living off the land to bypass defenses. Kraken shows sophisticated tradecraft indicative of an advanced persistent threat actor.
