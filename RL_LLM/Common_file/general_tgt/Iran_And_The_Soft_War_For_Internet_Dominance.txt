The PDF provides an overview of Iranian cyber operations and intrusion campaigns targeting civil society, political opposition, and foreign entities. It documents the activities of several Iranian state-sponsored groups including Infy, Cleaver, Rocket Kitten, and Sima. Infy is one of the most active groups targeting Iranian civil society and media. It uses spearphishing to distribute keylogging malware aimed at stealing credentials. Infy has been active since at least 2013 and its targets align with Iran's internal security interests. Cleaver (also known as Ghambar) conducts espionage campaigns against economic, military, and political targets. It is considered more sophisticated than other Iranian groups. Ghambar is a custom malware successor to TinyZBot used by Cleaver. It has features for remote access, command execution, and data exfiltration. Rocket Kitten has targeted Israeli and Western institutions since 2014. It relies on simple tactics like credential phishing and Metasploit payloads. Rocket Kitten has recently focused efforts on compromising Telegram accounts of Iranian dissidents. Sima impersonates organizations like HRW and USCIS to spearphish Iranian diaspora involved in women's rights and foreign policy. It uses professionally tailored emails with custom malware payloads. Sima represents an evolution in Iranian social engineering and targeting. Overall, the report documents the ongoing development of Iranian intrusion capabilities over several years. It highlights Iran's focus on domestic opponents and foreign adversaries. The groups collaborate and share tactics, evolving in response to public disclosures and targeting changes.
