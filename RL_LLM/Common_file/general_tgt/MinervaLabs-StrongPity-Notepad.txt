The cybersecurity firm Minerva Labs discusses a new campaign from the threat actor group StrongPity, also known as APT-C-41 and PROMETHIUM. StrongPity has been active since 2012 and is known for compromising legitimate software used by targeted individuals in watering hole attacks. In this campaign, the group hides its malware inside a Trojanized version of the popular Notepad++ text editor. When the malicious Notepad++ installer is run, it drops the legitimate Notepad++, along with two backdoors - a keylogger and a remote access tool. It also installs a persistent service to re-execute the remote access tool at startup. The keylogger (ntuis32.exe) records keystrokes to a hidden file that is later exfiltrated by the remote access tool (winpickr.exe). Winpickr repeatedly checks for new keystroke log files, sends them to the command and control server, and deletes them. This attack pattern matches previous StrongPity campaigns. The report concludes that this demonstration of living off the land tactics can easily bypass sandbox detection since it only installs programs and creates services, without immediately exhibiting malicious behavior. Minerva's data loss prevention module could prevent this type of attack.
