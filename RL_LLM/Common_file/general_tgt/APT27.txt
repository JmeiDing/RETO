In April 2020, a media company was hit with ransomware that encrypted files on their servers and workstations. Investigation revealed the company's network was first breached in early 2018, when attackers exploited a vulnerable server to gain initial access. The attackers used various tools like ChinaChopper, Mimikatz, EternalBlue etc. to move laterally and maintain persistence. They also mined cryptocurrency. In early 2020, the attackers lost access but regained it using the same tactics. They deployed Polar ransomware and demanded ransom. Investigation found the tactics resembled those of APT27 group, but attribution was not fully conclusive. The security team was able to decrypt files by brute forcing the encryption key based on system uptime data. Infrastructure was restored.
