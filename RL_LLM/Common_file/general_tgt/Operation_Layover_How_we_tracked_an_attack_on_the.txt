The PDF describes a cyberespionage campaign called Operation Layover that targeted the aviation industry. The attackers used spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to deliver a remote access trojan (RAT) called AsyncRAT. The initial attack vector was emails with PDF attachments that contained links to download Visual Basic Script (VBS) files from Google Drive. The VBS files contained obfuscated code to download and execute the AsyncRAT malware. Analysis uncovered that the campaign infrastructure and targeting overlapped with previous activity going back to at least 2018. The attackers had been targeting the aviation industry since then, with lures related to aviation like "Trip Itinerary" and "Bombardier." The report tracks the infrastructure and malware samples back to a threat actor that has been active for around 5 years, originating out of Nigeria. Although not sophisticated, the actor continues to compromise targets by evolving techniques like using crypters to hide malware. The report concludes that continuous small campaigns like this can still cause major damage. The actor likely uses the access to steal data and credentials that get sold on the black market to other cybercriminals.
