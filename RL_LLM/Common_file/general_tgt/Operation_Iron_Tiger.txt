The document describes a cyberespionage operation called Operation Iron Tiger conducted by a China-based threat actor group known as Emissary Panda or TG-3390. The group targeted organizations in the US defense and high-technology sectors starting in 2013 after years of monitoring political targets in China, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Tibet. The attackers used spear-phishing emails with malicious documents to initially compromise targets. The documents installed a custom backdoor called PlugX on victims' systems. The backdoor communicated with command servers and had capabilities to download modules, exfiltrate data, and execute commands. The group frequently recompiled their tools and malware and used living off the land tactics to evade detection. They abused utilities like WMIC, PowerShell, certutil, rundll32, etc. for downloading and executing payloads. The attackers stole terabytes of sensitive data including emails, intellectual property, and Active Directory credentials. Analysis uncovered the attackers' Chinese origins based on malware binaries, infrastructure, language settings, etc. Strong evidence tied the activities to a threat actor named Guo Fei located in China. The report details the custom and public tools used in the attacks along with IoCs. In summary, Operation Iron Tiger was a sophisticated, long-running cyberespionage campaign targeting sensitive data from US defense contractors and technology companies to benefit China. The threat actor behind it was located in China and used custom malware, infrastructure, and living off the land tactics to evade detection.
