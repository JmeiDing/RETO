The document discusses a new campaign by the cyberespionage group Tropic Trooper (also known as KeyBoy) that targeted government, healthcare, transportation, and technology organizations in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. Tropic Trooper typically uses exploit-laden Microsoft Office documents containing job vacancies to deliver malware. The latest campaign involved documents exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802 vulnerabilities in Microsoft Equation Editor. When opened, the document would download and install a malicious MSI file that drops a backdoor. Analysis of the malware revealed the use of DLL hijacking to evade detection, a encrypted configuration file using symmetric encryption, and custom SSL libraries to communicate with the command and control server. The group appears to be using separate malware projects such as HSSL and TSSL, with versioning indicating continual development. PDB strings provided further insight, including the use of a 64-bit malware version. The report highlights the need for proactive incident response strategies involving threat intelligence, network monitoring, access control, and security awareness training to detect and mitigate such targeted attacks. Specific recommendations include patching systems, least privilege principles, monitoring endpoints/networks/servers, and nurturing a culture of cybersecurity.
