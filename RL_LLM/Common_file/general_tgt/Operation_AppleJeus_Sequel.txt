The cybersecurity firm Kaspersky continued tracking the activities of the Lazarus hacking group, known for targeting cryptocurrency companies. This report details new campaigns named Operation AppleJeus Sequel. Lazarus developed new malware for macOS and Windows following their previous Operation AppleJeus. The macOS malware was redeveloped using new frameworks but retained similar behaviors like downloading a second stage payload. The Windows malware infection chain was elaborate, using multiple stages to carefully install a final backdoor. This backdoor was tailored to specific victim devices. Lazarus set up fake cryptocurrency company websites to distribute the malware through manipulated trading applications. They used Telegram channels and GitHub to host the malware. Victims were recorded in several countries including the UK, Poland, Russia, and China. Many were cryptocurrency businesses again. Lazarus continues to modify their tools and infrastructure over time to avoid detection. They are determined to keep targeting financial entities, especially cryptocurrency. Defenses need to evolve as their techniques do.
