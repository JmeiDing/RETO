The document analyzes a new campaign by the Iran-based threat actor group Lyceum, which targeted Middle Eastern organizations. The initial attack vector was a Word document macro that downloaded and executed a .NET-based DNS backdoor malware. The backdoor is a customized version of an open source DNS tool, modified to leverage DNS hijacking for command and control. It configures a malicious DNS server, generates a bot ID from the victim username, and sends DNS queries containing commands, which the malicious DNS server responds to with data exfiltration. The backdoor's capabilities include downloading additional payloads, uploading files, and executing system commands. It encodes and exfiltrates the command output in DNS requests to the attacker-controlled server. The threat actors spoofed an Iranian military news website to distribute the macro document. The .NET malware shows the group's continued effort to refine tactics like leveraging DNS traffic for stealthy command and control. The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, domain names, and patterns used in crafting malicious DNS queries. It demonstrates how adversaries modify publicly available tools and use standard protocols to avoid detection.
