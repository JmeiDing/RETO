Security Joes' incident response team investigated malicious activity in a client's network. The initial foothold was through compromised credentials of a Secure Access instance. The attackers used tools like SoftPerfect Network Scanner, ADFind, and AccountRestore to discover assets, harvest credentials, and brute force access. The attackers deployed a custom malware called Sockbot, which is a modified version of the open source tunneling tool Ligolo. Sockbot establishes persistence and command and control channels without needing command line parameters, avoiding detection. It exposes internal RDP servers for lateral movement. Sockbot was developed in the GoLand IDE and contains Russian language references, suggesting the threat actors are linked to a Russian ransomware gang. The tools and techniques match typical behavior of targeted ransomware groups. After gaining access to more systems, the attackers deployed Cobalt Strike beacons via PowerShell downloaders. The beacons connected to a C2 server and used process injection techniques. The incident response team contained the attack before significant damage was done. The tools, tactics, and target industry overlap with known ransomware groups. The custom malware indicates sophisticated actors borrowing from public tools but adding their own modifications. Overall, the attack demonstrates how credential theft can enable access for ransomware operators. The incident response disrupted the attackers before ransomware could be deployed across the network. Key takeaways are the multi-stage infection process, custom malware development, and attacker techniques aligned to known ransomware groups.
