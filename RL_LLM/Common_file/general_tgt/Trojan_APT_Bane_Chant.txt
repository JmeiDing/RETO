The PDF analyzes a new in-memory trojan called Trojan.APT.BaneChant that was likely used to target Middle Eastern and Central Asian governments. It uses multiple techniques to evade detection and analysis: - Detects multiple mouse clicks to avoid sandboxes that simulate only one click. - Downloads malicious code directly into memory rather than writing it to disk, avoiding forensic analysis. - Uses shortened URLs and dynamic DNS to hide malicious domains from blacklists. - Encrypts executables with XOR encoding to defeat network inspection. - Spoofs a legitimate process name and location to appear as a Google updater. Initial infection is via a weaponized RTF document exploiting CVE-2012-0158. This drops a downloader that retrieves stage 1 shellcode. The shellcode gets stage 2 malware hosted on a fake JPEG file. Stage 2 is the main trojan that profiles the system, sets up persistence, and acts as a backdoor for remote access. It exfiltrates data tagged with "BaneChant" and can download additional payloads. The advanced evasion techniques and fileless nature make the trojan stealthy and challenging to analyze. Recommendations include multiple AV engines, network monitoring, and user education against phishing.
