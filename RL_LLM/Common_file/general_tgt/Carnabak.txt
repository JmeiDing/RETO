The document is an RSA blog post and white paper detailing the response to an intrusion by the Carbanak cybercrime group against one of RSA's clients in early 2017. The intrusion was unique compared to previous Carbanak incidents in that it began with a higher level of access due to exploitation of a vulnerability in Apache Struts. This allowed the attackers to quickly gain administrative privileges in the Linux environment. The incident presented challenges due to the initial intrusion vector, unique attacker toolset, long dwell time before detection, large and complex environment, speed of attacker access, and operational security practices of the attackers. The attackers used a mix of custom tools, freely available code, and open source utilities across both Linux and Windows environments. Very few of the tools were detected by antivirus products. The toolsets focused on ingress/egress, lateral movement, log cleanup, credential harvesting, and internal reconnaissance. Though not sophisticated individually, the tools were sophisticated in how they were deployed and operated in an agile and cross-platform manner. The attackers were in the environment for 35 days before detection, but the RSA response team was able to fully contain, eradicate, and remediate the intrusion within 9 days. This rapid and successful response was attributed to the client having proper visibility, an empowered threat hunting team, established incident response methodologies, and a trusted third party relationship with RSA. The report concludes that Carbanak has evolved into a more mature, organized, and persistent threat actor group capable of intruding on both Linux and Windows environments. Their persistence, adaptability, operational security, and cross-platform capabilities make them difficult to detect and respond to. However, organizations that invest in visibility, people, processes, and relationships can overcome this adversity as evidenced by RSA's effective response to the incident on behalf of their client.
