The report details the activities of a new APT group called LazyScripter that has been active since at least 2018. Initial infection vectors included phishing emails with employment themes as well as IATA and airline themes. The emails contained malicious documents or links to download the group's loader malware called KOCTOPUS or EMPODER. These installed multiple stages of open-source RATs like Octopus, Koadic, and Empire. The group gathered credentials, moved laterally, and overcame network segmentation. They compromised a router VM to use it as a proxy server for data exfiltration from isolated segments. Custom tunneling tools were used to create covert channels. The report analyzes the TTPs, infrastructure, and connections to other APTs. While some similarities exist with groups like APT28 and MuddyWater, key differences indicate LazyScripter is a new undocumented threat actor. Ongoing tracking shows the group is still active, maintaining infrastructure and updating tools. IOCs and MITRE ATT&CK mapping are provided. The report concludes LazyScripter is a developing cyberespionage actor that has targeted various industries over several years, recently focusing on IATA and airlines. Their attacks involve multiple stages of open-source malware and constantly evolving phishing lures.
