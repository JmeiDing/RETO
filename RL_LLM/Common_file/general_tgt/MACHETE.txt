The document is a white paper by ESET researching a cyberespionage malware called Machete. Machete has been targeting high-profile individuals and organizations in Latin America since at least 2010. ESET has detected an ongoing campaign by Machete operators targeting over 50 victims, with a focus on Venezuelan military organizations. Machete uses spearphishing to deliver malware that exfiltrates documents and data. Operators take time to craft convincing emails, using stolen documents as lures. Machete steals Office documents, images, and specialized files related to geographic positioning and navigation routes. The malware takes screenshots, logs keystrokes, accesses the clipboard, communicates over FTP/HTTP, encrypts and exfiltrates documents, detects inserted drives to copy files, updates its configuration and binaries, and more. Technical analysis reveals Machete has evolved over time by adding features like physical exfiltration, geolocation, multi-layer obfuscation, and fallback communication methods. Different components handle scheduling, data collection, communication, and more. Encryption, encoding, and other tactics are used to hide malware files and exfiltrate data stealthily. In 2019, over 75% of victims were Venezuelan military. Other Latin American countries were targeted too. Machete appears developed by a Spanish-speaking group, likely in Latin America, due to language artifacts in code. The group constantly refines tactics and infrastructure to avoid detection. They quickly exploit stolen documents, using them as lures for new victims the same day. Machete remains an active threat conducting cyberespionage against high-value targets in Latin America.
