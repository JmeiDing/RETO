The document discusses a campaign dubbed Goldfin that has been active since February 2017 targeting financial institutions in Commonwealth of Independent States countries with spearphishing emails containing malware. The emails spoof legitimate banks and contain links to download an archive containing malicious JavaScript that ultimately delivers a malware implant called SOCKSBOT to compromised systems. SOCKSBOT is a backdoor capable of keylogging, screen capturing, downloading files, and arbitrary code execution. The malware uses various stages of obfuscated JavaScript and PowerShell scripts to eventually reflectively load SOCKSBOT into memory without writing files to disk. While some security vendors attribute the activity to APT CANDLEFISH, analysis of tactics, techniques, and procedures lead the researchers to assess with moderate confidence Goldfin is a distinct threat group not likely associated with CANDLEFISH. Noteworthy infrastructure and code overlaps are observed between Goldfin and FIN7, including shared domain WHOIS information, hosting IP addresses, and uncommon PowerShell obfuscation methods. While not enough to attribute Goldfin to FIN7, it reveals complex relationships in cybercrime. In total, the Goldfin campaign demonstrates a sophisticated, stealthy, and persistent threat targeting CIS financial organizations over an extended period for cyber espionage and financial gain.
