The report analyzes a new backdoor called Pierogi used in recent cyberespionage campaigns targeting Palestinian individuals and entities, likely related to the Palestinian government. The campaigns distribute weaponized documents with geopolitical themes as lures to infect targets with Pierogi. Decoy content focuses on political affairs in the Middle East related to Hamas and other regional tensions. Pierogi is a Delphi backdoor that allows attackers to collect system info, upload files, take screenshots, execute commands, and download additional payloads. It uses shortcuts for persistence and Ukrainian-language strings. The backdoor queries antivirus products installed on the system and implements other checks to avoid detection. It communicates with a C2 server to send system info, receive commands, upload data, and remove traces. Infrastructure analysis suggests threat actors set up new domains in November 2019 specifically for this campaign. The tactics align with previous activity by an Arabic APT group called MoleRATs. The report concludes the threat actors carefully crafted this campaign to compromise Palestinian targets, obtaining the Pierogi backdoor likely from underground sources. Defenders should block associated infrastructure.
