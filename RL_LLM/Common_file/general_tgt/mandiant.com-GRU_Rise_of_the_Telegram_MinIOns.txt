The document details Mandiant's tracking of several purported hacktivist groups conducting cyber operations in support of Russian interests against Ukraine, including through DDoS attacks and data leaks. Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that the moderators of the Telegram channels "XakNet Team," "Infoccentr," and "CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn" are coordinating their operations with the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)-sponsored threat actor APT28. This assessment is based on the deployment of APT28 tools like CADDYWIPER on Ukrainian networks shortly before data from those entities was leaked on Telegram by the hacktivist groups. Additional evidence includes a unique APT28 artifact found in a XakNet data leak and similarities to historical APT28 information operations. XakNet in particular has exhibited activity consistent with APT28 information operations. The group heavily publicizes its patriotic hacktivism narrative and has claimed responsibility for high-profile propaganda operations against Ukraine. Mandiant continues to explore connections between these Telegram channels and Russian state-sponsored groups. The coordination allows Russia to conduct cyber espionage, attacks, and influence campaigns while maintaining a guise of independent hacktivist activity. With Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, Mandiant assesses cyber threats pose an elevated risk to Ukrainian organizations.
