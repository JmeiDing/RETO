The PDF describes cyberattacks by a threat actor group called DarkHydrus that targeted a Middle Eastern government agency in July 2018. The attacks involved spear-phishing emails with password-protected RAR archives containing malicious Excel spreadsheet files ending in .iqy. When opened, the .iqy files retrieved a PowerShell script payload from a command and control server. The payload used DNS tunneling for C2 communication and contained capabilities like keylogging, screenshot capture, file uploads, and command execution. It checked for sandbox environments before installing persistence and extraction information from the system. The payload interacts with the C2 server to obtain commands based on its command handler. Researchers were able to connect the infrastructure used in this attack to earlier DarkHydrus campaigns going back to early 2016. The group primarily uses OpenOffice and Microsoft Office files to retrieve modular payloads often based on open-source penetration testing tools. The domains used for C2 infrastructure mimicked technology vendors and were hosted on servers linked to a suspected Iranian threat actor. Overlaps in TTPs were found with the CopyKittens group, but firm attribution could not be made. Indicators of compromise found include MD5 hashes for payloads and weaponized documents, C2 domains, and IP addresses of associated servers. Recommendations include detection based on these IOCs and blocking OFfice macros and .iqy files to prevent infection. The PDF provides an overview of DarkHydrus' methods and demonstrates their ability to adapt new techniques like Excel .iqy files into their evolving attack campaigns.
