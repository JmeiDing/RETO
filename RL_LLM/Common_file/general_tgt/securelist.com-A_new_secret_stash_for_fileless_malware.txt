The report analyzes a malicious campaign that uses innovative techniques to hide malware and evade detection. The attackers use shellcode hidden in Windows event logs, allowing a fileless final stage Trojan to evade traditional detection. The dropper modules also patch Windows APIs related to event tracing and anti-malware scanning to make the infection stealthier. The malware checks if the host is in a specific domain and only works if it's true. It then dynamically resolves the addresses of the mentioned functions. The next stager is encrypted with AES256 (CBC mode), and the key and IV are encoded with base64. The malware generates a fingerprinting string by gathering information such as MachineGUID, computer name, local IP addresses, architecture, OS version, SeDebugPrivilege, and sleep time. The module decrypts C2 domains with a one-byte XOR key and communicates over HTTP with RC4 encryption or unencrypted with named pipes. The malware connects to a hardcoded domain on port 443 and sends POST requests to submit.php on the C2 side, using HTTPS connection options that accept self-signed certificates on the server side. The campaign shows signs of reconnaissance, with C2 domains mimicking legitimate software used by the victim. The infrastructure uses VPS services like Linode, Namecheap, and DreamVPS. The attackers use commercial pentesting tools like Cobalt Strike and SilentBreak, combined with custom decryptors and anti-analysis techniques. Some modules are digitally signed to avoid detection. Two types of final stage Trojans are used - one HTTP-based and one using named pipes. Both leverage process injection heavily. The report details the multi-stage infection chain, starting with document exploitation to drop the main malware, which stores shellcode in event logs. A loader gathers the shellcode and launches next stage Trojans. The attack is targeted, with custom malware for each victim compiled on-the-fly. The campaign shows the capabilities of the threat actor in evading defenses through innovative techniques like fileless malware in event logs.
