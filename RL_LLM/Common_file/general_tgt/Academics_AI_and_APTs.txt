The report analyzes six Chinese universities with connections to state-sponsored hacking groups that are conducting research on applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to cyber operations. The universities researched include Hainan University, Southeast University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Xidian University, Zhejiang University, and Harbin Institute of Technology. Each has affiliations with groups like APT1, APT3, APT40, and other advanced persistent threat actors. Research topics at the schools include using ML for network defense, malware detection, vulnerability discovery, traffic analysis, password cracking, and more. Some academics are publishing strategic overviews of AI's potential impact on cyber operations. Two universities are also researching attacking and defending AI systems themselves. Coursework at Zhejiang University covers topics like data poisoning, adversarial examples, and model inversion. The close relationships between academics and hacking groups means new techniques can quickly transition from lab research to operations. Understanding the research provides insights into capabilities China's state-sponsored hackers may field in the future.
