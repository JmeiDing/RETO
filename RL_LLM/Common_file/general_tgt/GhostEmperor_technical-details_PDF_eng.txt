The document provides a technical analysis of the GhostEmperor cyberespionage campaign. It examines the multi-stage infection chain and post-exploitation tools used by the threat actor. The infection starts with a PowerShell dropper script that decrypts and installs a rootkit driver and malicious service. The service loader decrypts and executes an in-memory implant that facilitates C2 communication. The implant uses malleable C2 profiles to mask its traffic as Amazon browsing. The implant can retrieve additional payloads from the C2 server. These include a remote control DLL for desktop control, .NET assembly loading, PowerShell execution, and filesystem access. The attackers leveraged both legitimate tools like PsExec and Mimikatz as well as custom malware for post-exploitation activities. Actions included password dumping, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. Specific tools used were NBTScan, ProcDump, WinRAR, BITSAdmin, PowerShell scripts, Ladon, Mimikat, Token.exe, and others. The tools were used to gather information about other systems, spread on the network, and steal sensitive data. In summary, the campaign demonstrates sophisticated malware development with covert C2 communications, advanced post-compromise capabilities, and operational security through use of living-off-the-land tools. The technical analysis provides insights into the infection tactics, techniques, and procedures of this advanced persistent threat group.
