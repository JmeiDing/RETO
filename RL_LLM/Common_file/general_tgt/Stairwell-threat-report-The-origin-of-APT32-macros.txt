The report analyzes source code for a malware toolkit called StrikeSuit Gift that appears linked to the threat actor APT32. The code contains Visual Studio solutions for building malicious Office documents with embedded macros. It includes shellcode test files, obfuscation routines, GUI utilities for creating payloads, and more. Analysis of timestamps, developer fingerprints, and code reuse indicates the toolkit was actively developed around 2016-2017. The report explores StrikeSuit Gift's techniques like using VB macros to run PowerShell scripts and scheduled tasks for persistence. Similarities are drawn to APT32 operations before and after 2017. The toolmarks point to Vietnamese developers and testing for compatibility with Vietnam-based antivirus products. The obfuscation code shares techniques with known APT32 malware for generating randomized strings. Embed Office Macros GUI resembles previous APT32 macro builders. The report concludes StrikeSuit Gift provides source code-level insight into APT32's malware development practices. It likely represents an earlier generation of their ongoing toolkit. By exposing the code, the report aims to advance threat intelligence and help defenders understand and mitigate APT32's tactics.
