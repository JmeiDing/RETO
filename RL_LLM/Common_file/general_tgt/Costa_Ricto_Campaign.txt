The PDF describes a cyber-espionage campaign named CostaRicto conducted by a mercenary hacking group offering APT-style attacks. The campaign has been active since October 2019 targeting organizations globally, with a concentration in South Asia. The group uses custom malware called SombRAT with versions and detailed logging, suggesting long-term development. SombRAT is delivered via phishing using SSH tunnels and proxied C2 infrastructure. An obfuscated VM-based loader called CostaBricks decodes and injects the payload. SombRAT features versions, RSA encryption, plugin architecture, and DNS tunneling C2 capabilities. The malware collects system info, uploads files, and downloads additional payloads. The name may reference the Overwatch character Sombra known for hacking and espionage. Infrastructure analysis reveals overlaps with Android malware, Emotet, Trickbot, and Russian cybercrime sites. Targets cover various sectors in 46 countries lacking a clear pattern, indicating a mercenary model serving diverse clients. Tactics include credential theft, complex proxying, customized malware, and mimicking infrastructure of security firms. The technical sophistication exceeds typical cybercrime groups, suggesting sponsorship by advanced threat actors. In summary, the report profiles the tactics, tools, infrastructure, targets, and timeline of an espionage campaign-for-hire demonstrating sophisticated tradecraft indicative of a skilled mercenary group.
