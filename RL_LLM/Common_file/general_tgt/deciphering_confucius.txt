The document discusses cyberespionage operations by a group called Confucius that researchers stumbled upon while investigating Patchwork. Though similarities exist, Confucius and Patchwork appear to be separate groups possibly within the same community. Confucius relies heavily on social engineering, exploiting romance scams and chat apps to persuade targets to install malware. Their Windows and Android chat apps have legitimate features but also stealthily collect data and harvest SMS messages, contacts, accounts, etc. The apps target specific individuals like military personnel and businessmen in South Asian countries. Chat logs show operators engaging a target through a fake romance to urge installing the malware. Confucius uses tailored backdoors and file stealers resembling Patchwork's tools. They exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities to deliver malware via Office documents. The stolen data is exfiltrated by abusing a cloud storage service. Their recent activities exploiting a Dec 2017 vulnerability and the array of backdoors like sctrls, ByeBye Shell, remote-access-c3 etc. show Confucius is actively pursuing targets. The social engineering and malware connections indicate Confucius and Patchwork are separate but likely in the same community. The report examines Confucius' tactics, malware tools, infrastructure, and mitigation strategies organizations can adopt to defend against such targeted cyberespionage campaigns.
