The PDF describes a supply-chain cyberespionage operation called Operation NightScout that compromised the update mechanism of NoxPlayer, an Android emulator software, to deliver malware to victims. NoxPlayer is made by BigNox and has over 150 million users, primarily gamers in Asia. Highly targeted updates containing 3 different malware families were delivered to a small subset of victims in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Sri Lanka starting in September 2020. The malware gave surveillance capabilities and was not used for financial gain, indicating state-sponsored espionage as the motivation. Similar loader code was seen in past attacks on Myanmar and Hong Kong entities. The attackers compromised the BigNox update infrastructure to replace legitimate updates with malware. The PDF provides technical details on the update process and indicators of compromise like registry keys, file paths, and network connections. The 3 malware variants delivered were an unnamed backdoor, a Gh0st RAT trojan, and PoisonIvy RAT. Their capabilities included command execution, screen capture, file exfiltration, and keylogging. The report concludes supply-chain attacks are increasing among cyber espionage actors as a stealthy means to compromise targets. The vertically targeted nature of this attack on the gaming industry was unusual and concerning.
