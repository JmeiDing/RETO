The document describes analysis by threat intelligence firm QuoIntelligence of new malware samples attributed to the Winnti cyberespionage group. Winnti has been active since at least 2010, targeting various industries like gaming, chemicals, and pharma. In January 2020, QuoInt discovered a new Winnti sample likely used to target a German chemical company in 2015. Analysis revealed a previously undocumented DNS tunneling technique using the open source tool iodine to communicate with command and control servers. The malware generates encoded subdomains to send DNS queries that proxy through legitimate servers. The malware uses stolen digital certificates like one from Taiwanese company IQ Technology to sign components. Another sample was found targeting a South Korean gaming company, Gravity Co. Ltd., further confirming Winnti's interest in that industry. QuoInt assesses Winnti remains a highly capable advanced persistent threat conducting sophisticated, targeted attacks against organizations globally. The group continues to evolve its tactics, techniques, and procedures. Recommended defenses include monitoring DNS traffic for anomalies, enforcing certificate validation, and using AV and endpoint detection solutions. The report highlights the ongoing threat Winnti poses to a variety of public and private sector entities through its cyberespionage campaigns. QuoInt recommends increased government oversight and regulation to ensure vulnerable organizations improve security practices against such attacks.
