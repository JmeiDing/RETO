The document analyzes a malware named Casper that was used in attacks against targets in Syria in April 2014. Casper is a Trojan horse that chooses its strategy based on the behavior of the antivirus software running on the target machine. Casper was distributed via Flash zero-day exploits hosted on a Syrian government website. It is attributed to the same threat actor behind the Babar and Bunny malware described in previous reports. First, it retrieves the tags in the configuration file, which define how the malware should behave. If the "ESCAPE" attribute is set to "NO" in the selected policy, the XML commands in the configuration file will be executed. The malware can uninstall other instances of Casper that may be running on the system. On first execution, the Casper payload generates a report containing system information and sends it to the C&C server via an HTTP POST request. Casper takes measures to evade detection, including disabling certain behaviors if antivirus products are detected, and obscuring API calls. The malware fingerprints specific antivirus products and selects evasion tactics accordingly. Casper's payload gathers extensive system information and reports back to a command and control server. The C2 can then send additional commands to further control the infected system. Code analysis identified similarities between Casper, Babar, Bunny, and other malware in terms of antivirus evasion methods, command and control communications, and other shared code, indicating they were developed by the same organization. The attacks were precisely targeted against individuals in Syria. The hosting of the malware on a Syrian government website may have been an attempt to mislead attribution. The report concludes Casper demonstrates this threat actor's continued development of malware for espionage purposes, and their willingness to leverage zero-day exploits as part of targeted attacks.
