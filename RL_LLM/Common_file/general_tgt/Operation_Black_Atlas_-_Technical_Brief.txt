The report provides technical analysis of the Black Atlas cybercrime operation targeting point-of-sale (POS) systems. The attackers used penetration testing tools to gain initial access to target networks through brute forcing remote desktop protocols. Once inside, they used malicious tools like password stealers and remote access trojans to maintain persistence and steal data. They employed information stealing malware called Gorynych that captured keystrokes and credentials. Gorynych also specifically targeted Bitcoin wallets and downloaded the BlackPOS RAM scraper to steal payment card data from POS systems. The modularity of Gorynych allows adding other capabilities as needed. In addition to Gorynych, the attackers planted various known POS malware like NewPOSThings, Neutrino, and Project Hook. They set up command and control infrastructure and customized malware installers for regional targets. Victims were primarily small and medium sized businesses in retail, manufacturing, and healthcare in the US and Europe. The report provides recommendations on improving security around remote access, passwords, logging, and limiting data.
