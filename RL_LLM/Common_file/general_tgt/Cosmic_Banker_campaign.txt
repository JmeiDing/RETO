The PDF describes an ongoing phishing campaign named Cosmic Banker that targets users of Mexican banking institutions. The campaign uses emails impersonating Mexico's tax authority SAT to trick users into downloading malware. The malware analysis reveals that the attack starts with an email containing a link to download a malicious .zip file. This file contains a .bat script that executes a Powershell script from the internet. The Powershell script downloads additional malware components from a remote server. The downloaded malware includes a DLL file and an executable that are part of a malware toolkit called Autolt. The malware renames and moves these files to the %Public% folder and creates persistence mechanisms. The malware also contains code to harvest email addresses from the victim's Outlook contacts and exfiltrate them to the attacker's server. Text strings in the malware binaries provide evidence that this campaign has links to a previous campaign called Banload that targeted Brazilian banking users. The reuse of code and similar artifacts indicates the two campaigns are by the same threat actor group. In summary, the PDF provides a detailed technical analysis of an ongoing and evolving phishing campaign targeting banking credentials. It reveals the attack tactics, techniques and procedures used as well as the infrastructure supporting the campaign. The analysis provides evidence linking this campaign to previous attacks on Brazilian banks.
