The PDF provides an analysis of a malicious Microsoft Word document that is believed to be part of a phishing campaign by the threat actor group Nobelium, also known as Dark Halo. The document contains a visual lure impersonating a communication from the Israeli embassy, with content designed to trick the user into enabling macros. When activated, the macros execute a script that decrypts and installs a malicious DLL payload. Technical analysis is provided on the infection process, showing how the document retrieves and executes a multi-stage JavaScript and DLL payload. The DLL gathers system info and communicates with a remote C2 server via the trello.com platform. The campaign leverages current events and themes like the Israeli embassy to create believable lures for targeted attacks. The malware exhibited low detection rates when analyzed. Attribution to Nobelium is based on TTP similarities with this APT group's previous activity. Indicators of compromise are provided, including file hashes, C2 infrastructure, and YARA rules to detect the malware. Defenders can use this information to hunt for related infections and enhance detection capabilities. In summary, the PDF provides a look at how sophisticated attackers like Nobelium continue to leverage strategic phishing lures and evasive malware tradecraft to infiltrate high-value targets and steal data. Detailed analysis aims to equip defenders with insights needed to thwart this activity.
