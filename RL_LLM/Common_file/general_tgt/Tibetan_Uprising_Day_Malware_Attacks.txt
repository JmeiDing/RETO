The Citizen Lab research brief analyzes two email-based malware attacks targeting the Tibetan community around the anniversary of the March 10 Tibetan Uprising Day in 2015. The first attack used a new malware family called MsAttacker that connected to command and control servers in China. The malware was delivered via emails purporting to contain information about March 10 commemoration events, with attachments that exploited a Microsoft Word vulnerability. The second attack used the known ShadowNet malware family and infrastructure linked to previous campaigns targeting Tibetans. The delivery method was similar, with emails about March 10 events containing weaponized attachments. There are indications the two attacks may have been coordinated given the timing, use of the same exploit, some overlapping infrastructure, and targeting of the Tibetan community. The attacks demonstrate the heightened cyber threat around important Tibetan events and anniversaries. The Citizen Lab provides indicators of compromise and recommendations for users to increase awareness, exercise caution around emails with attachments, and use services like VirusTotal to analyze suspicious files. They continue to monitor these threats.
