The article analyzes a new malware called Flagpro used by the cybercriminal group BlackTech to target Japanese organizations. In the initial attack, emails with malicious macro documents are sent to targets. The macros drop the Flagpro malware which communicates with a command and control server. Flagpro can download and execute additional malware, run commands, and collect system info to send back. Two versions were seen - an older one and a new version using MFC libraries. The malware automatically closes security dialogs during execution to avoid detection. Commands contain actions like downloading files or running OS commands. The C2 communication uses encoded HTTP requests to specific paths. Flagpro has been seen in attacks since October 2020. BlackTech adjusts the malware for targets and has started using other new malware, indicating they are actively evolving their tools. Network and endpoint detection can focus on Flagpro's HTTP requests patterns, temp file naming, and commands run after connection to the C2. Defenders should monitor BlackTech's continued evolution.
