The malware Babar was revealed in leaked documents from Canadian intelligence agency CSEC. Babar shares similarities with the Bunny malware family which has been analyzed previously. Evidence like compile timestamps, user agent strings, and filenames correlate Babar and Bunny. New Bunny variants contain the project name Babar64, further linking the two families. Some factors indicate the malware may originate from France, but attribution is still uncertain. While linked to Babar, Bunny has lower complexity than other APT malware like Turla and Equation.
