The document describes a new sophisticated technique detected being used by some countries in Asia to infect systems with remote access trojans (RATs). Traditional RAT deployment involves files that are easier to detect. In this new technique, the RAT payload remains entirely in memory during execution, never touching the disk in a decrypted state. This avoids detection by antivirus tools that focus on file-based threats. The samples can also detect virtual machines used for analysis. The RAT itself is not new, just the stealthy delivery method. The analysis shows the payload injecting into a new process for execution rather than being written to disk. Encrypted RAT settings are extracted from image files. The RAT then connects back to a command and control server. While the behavior-based detection of SentinelOne endpoint protection is able to catch this attack by monitoring system calls, traditional antivirus would miss it since no malicious files touch disk. The summary highlights an advanced and concerning new technique to stealthily deploy known RATs completely in memory. Avoiding writing decrypted payloads to disk enables evasion of file-focused defenses. SentinelOne claims behavior-based monitoring can detect this new method at the kernel level when the RAT payload interacts with the system.
