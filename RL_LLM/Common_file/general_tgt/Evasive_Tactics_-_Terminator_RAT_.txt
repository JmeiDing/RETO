The report from FireEye documents an analysis of a recent cyberattack campaign targeting entities in Taiwan. The attackers used spear-phishing emails with malware-laden attachments exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The malware payload was a remote access trojan called Terminator RAT, also known as FakeM RAT. The malware analysis revealed the attackers made modifications to Terminator RAT to evade detection, including: - Installs itself then deletes to only run after a system reboot, avoiding sandboxes. - Uses a component to relay traffic between the malware and proxy servers. - Removes identifiable fake messenger header patterns from network communications. - Expands the malware file size to avoid file-based scanning filters. - Changes the startup folder location in the registry to hide persistence. The command and control IPs resolved to a network linked to previous attacks deploying other malware like WinData and Protux. The campaign targeted organizations in Taiwan over more than a year, indicating an advanced persistent threat actor. FireEye concludes these modifications to known malware like Terminator RAT allow attackers to evade defenses. They recommend continuous research and detection improvements to identify malware callback patterns and exploitation attempts.
