The document describes activity by a threat group called ACTINIUM that has been targeting organizations in Ukraine for around a decade. ACTINIUM is assessed to be operating out of Crimea with objectives consistent with cyber espionage, and the Ukrainian government has attributed it to Russia's FSB intelligence agency. Since October 2021, ACTINIUM has targeted Ukrainian organizations involved in emergency response, security, and aid distribution, likely to gather intelligence. Their primary tactics include spear-phishing emails with documents containing malicious macros that retrieve additional payloads, using randomized infrastructure to evade detection, and deploying remote access tools like Pterodo and UltraVNC for persistent access. The report provides technical details on ACTINIUM's tactics, including their use of remote templates to evade static detections, rapid development of obfuscated malware like PowerPunch, and quiet data exfiltration capabilities in the QuietSieve malware family. Indicators of compromise from Microsoft's analysis are listed, including specific malware samples, domains, IP addresses, file hashes, and other artifacts. The report also covers detection capabilities in Microsoft 365 Defender, Sentinel, and provides advanced hunting queries to identify related activity. Overall, the document provides a comprehensive overview of ACTINIUM's recent cyber espionage activity targeting Ukraine, including their tactics, malware, infrastructure, and recommendations for detection and mitigation. It offers in-depth technical analysis to inform network defenders and researchers.
