The PDF describes a campaign by the threat actor group Mustang Panda, also known as TA416, RedDelta, or PKPLUG, that uses a new Korplug malware variant named Hodur. The campaign targets organizations in East and Southeast Asia, especially Mongolia and Vietnam, as well as some in Europe and Africa. Victims include diplomatic entities, research organizations, and internet service providers. The attack chain involves phishing emails with decoy documents on current events to distribute a downloader, which deploys a vulnerable signed executable, malicious loader DLL, and encrypted Korplug payload. The loader hijacks the executable to decrypt and execute Korplug. Korplug (PlugX) is a remote access trojan used by multiple threat actors. The Hodur variant communicates with C&C servers using a custom TCP-based protocol with encrypted and compressed payloads. It has capabilities for reconnaissance, file operations, process creation, command execution, and data exfiltration. Hodur uses several anti-analysis techniques like API obfuscation and opaque predicates. It can persist via Run registry keys or scheduled tasks. The decoys, encryption, obfuscation, and file wiping of indicators show how Mustang Panda iterates and improves their tools over time. The campaign has been ongoing since at least August 2021 and shows Mustang Panda's ability to leverage major news events. The report provides in-depth analysis of the full attack chain, C&C protocol, and Hodur capabilities.
