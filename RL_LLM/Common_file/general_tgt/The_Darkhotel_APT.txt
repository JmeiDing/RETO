The document analyzes an advanced persistent threat (APT) group called Darkhotel, also known as Tapaoux. The group has been active for over 7 years, targeting high-profile victims like executives and government officials staying at luxury hotels. The group uses sophisticated techniques including spearphishing emails with malicious attachments, compromising hotel Wi-Fi networks, and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. They install backdoors on systems to steal data like keylogs, credentials, and sensitive documents. Darkhotel signs malware with stolen digital certificates, showing technical capabilities like cracking weak 512-bit RSA keys. The malware takes steps to avoid detection and analysis. Different components target spreading through networks, stealing data, and maintaining persistence. Victims are found globally but concentrated in Japan, Taiwan, China, Russia, and Korea. Darkhotel tracks victims centrally via web interfaces on its command and control servers. The group carries out additional mass campaigns to build botnets. The report concludes that Darkhotel is a skilled threat actor that will continue targeted attacks against government, military, and business organizations. It provides technical details on the group's tactics, techniques, and procedures to help potential targets detect and defend against the APT group.
