Here is a summary of the key points from the Donot Team APT group analysis PDF: Donot Team is an APT group that has been active since at least 2012 targeting organizations in South Asia, particularly Pakistan's government sector. Researchers noticed expanded activity from the group in 2019 hitting targets in Bangladesh, Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Argentina, UAE, and Great Britain. The initial infection vector is phishing emails containing weaponized Office documents that load additional payloads. A code execution exploit in Equation Editor is used to install two malicious loaders named Serviceflow.exe and sinter.exe. The loaders establish persistence and gather system information. Donot Team frequently changes its loader code to hinder analysis. Different encryption schemes are applied to obfuscate strings each time new versions are compiled. Debugging artifacts reveal the developer tests loaders against security products like BitDefender. The primary purpose of the loaders is to deploy modules from the yty malware framework used by the attackers. This allows them to exfiltrate documents, log keystrokes, take screenshots, and remotely control compromised machines. Network infrastructure patterns can help identify Donot Team activity. The group uses privacy services to anonymize domain registration info and reserves separate servers for each domain. Servers are typically hosted with DigitalOcean in Amsterdam. The group prefers .top, .pw, and .space TLDs. By studying Donot Team's tactics, researchers uncovered attack infrastructure still active in 2019. The frequent revisions to the group's loaders indicates an advanced adversary that is determined, adaptable, and closely tracks incident response activities intended to disrupt its cyber espionage operations.
