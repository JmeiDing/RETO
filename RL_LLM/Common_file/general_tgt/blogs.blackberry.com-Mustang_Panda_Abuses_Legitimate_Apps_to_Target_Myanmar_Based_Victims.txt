The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team uncovered a campaign by the China-based advanced persistent threat (APT) group Mustang Panda targeting Myanmar using the PlugX malware family. Mustang Panda typically sends phishing emails with malicious document attachments as an initial infection vector. Once threat actors gain a foothold within a target organization, they typically deploy payloads such as Cobalt Strike or PlugX. The PlugX malware is used by Mustang Panda to deliver the implant in the form of an encrypted data blob, which is typically paired with a DLL loader and a benign application. In this case, the researchers found PlugX payloads bundled with legitimate signed HP utilities in RAR files communicating with domains masquerading as Myanmar news outlets. The executables side-load malicious DLLs which decrypt and deploy the PlugX payload. This aligns with Mustang Panda's typical tactics of using legitimate apps to stealthily deploy PlugX. The researchers found evidence of related activity back to late 2020. Given the targeting of Myanmar entities, use of PlugX, and impersonation of local news, the campaign fits Mustang Panda's modus operandi. Defenders can use the provided indicators of compromise and mitigation techniques to detect this threat.
