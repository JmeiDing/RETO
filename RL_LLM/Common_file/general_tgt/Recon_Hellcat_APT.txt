The PDF describes a new malware campaign conducted by a threat actor group called ReconHellcat in late November 2020. The group distributed a malicious loader dubbed Loader.ReconHellcat via a spear phishing email containing a CAB file impersonating a document from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). When executed, the loader retrieved and installed a new remote access trojan (RAT) malware that the researchers named BlackSoul, along with a supporting DLL named blacksoulLib. BlackSoul contained capabilities to run commands, transfer files, and exfiltrate data from the victim's machine back to its command and control server. Analysis found BlackSoul and the Loader.ReconHellcat sample shared code similarities and tactics, techniques, and procedures with a previous ReconHellcat campaign distributing the BlackWater malware. These included lure themes, architecture, obfuscation methods, C2 communications, and hosting infrastructure. This led the researchers to attribute the new campaign to the ReconHellcat group with high confidence. While the specific targeting is unclear, the NIST theme suggests the campaign likely targeted a government-related entity. ReconHellcat has previously targeted defense and diplomatic organizations. Technical details about the malware's capabilities and attack chain are provided. Indicators of compromise for the malware and infrastructure are included.
