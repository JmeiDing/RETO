The document analyzes a phishing campaign dubbed "The Return of the Charming Kitten" carried out by Iranian state-backed hackers. The campaign targeted individuals involved in sanctions against Iran, as well as politicians, activists, and journalists. The phishing attacks used two main tactics - sending messages from unknown accounts or compromised accounts of public figures. The emails contained fake alerts about unauthorized account access or fake shared Google Drive links. The phishing pages were customized for desktop and mobile and designed to steal credentials and 2-factor verification codes in real time. The hackers used sites.google.com, hidden tracking pixels, and image links to bypass detection. Technical analysis revealed the hackers used VPNs and proxies to hide their location, but some real IP addresses were uncovered tracing back to Iran. Over 20 phishing domains were set up for the campaign. The campaign shows the hackers carefully researched targets and tailored attacks specifically to them. The timing coincides with new US sanctions on Iran. Recommendations include switching to security keys for 2-factor authentication, enabling advanced account protection, and informing users about phishing threats. Overall, the report provides in-depth analysis of the hackers' tactics, techniques, infrastructure, and motivations.
