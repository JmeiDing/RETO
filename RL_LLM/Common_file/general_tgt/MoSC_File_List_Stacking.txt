The PDF discusses methods for hunting web shells in an enterprise environment. Web shells are files containing malicious backdoor functionality that allow an attacker remote access when hosted on a public-facing system. The method discussed is called file stacking, which involves identifying uncommon files across servers to find anomalies that could be web shells. For file stacking with timestamps, files are sorted by creation time to identify web shells created at atypical isolated times compared to legitimate scripts. For file stacking with file paths, files are sorted by path to identify web shells in unique locations. Other tips include: - Focus on web servers, not workstations - Limit search to extensions like ASP, ASPX on IIS servers - Search web hosting directories like wwwroot, Apache, ColdFusion folders - Review web shells with isolated creation times - Review web shells with unique paths compared to others The goal is to use file stacking to identify the most uncommon scripts that stand out as anomalies. This can help surface web shells that blend in among thousands of legitimate files. With focused search criteria and sorting, web shells created by attackers can be identified through when and where they were created.
