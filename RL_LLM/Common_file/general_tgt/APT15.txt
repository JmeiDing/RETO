APT15, also known as Ke3chang, Mirage, Vixen Panda GREF and Playful Dragon, is a sophisticated advanced persistent threat group that targeted UK government departments and military technology. The group expanded its arsenal during the incident, including new backdoors such as BS2005, RoyalCli, and RoyalDNS. RoyalCli injects commands into Internet Explorer to communicate with C&C servers. RoyalDNS uses DNS TXT records. APT15 used additional tools such as WinRAR, Mimikatz, and spwebmember for data extraction, keylogging, and enumeration. The group also conducted lateral movement through net command, mounting the C$ share of hosts, and manually copying files. APT15 used stolen VPN certificates to regain access after being ejected from the network. Analysis of cached IE web browser data revealed over 200 commands executed by APT15 during the intrusion. APT15 relies on living off the land tactics using native Windows tools for reconnaissance and lateral movement.
