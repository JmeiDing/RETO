In September 2020, the U.S. Justice Department charged 5 Chinese citizens associated with the APT41 hacking group for cyberattacks on over 100 organizations globally. The hackers engaged in cryptojacking, ransomware attacks, theft of source code and PII, video game fraud, and more. They used public exploits and supply chain attacks to compromise targets. Trend Micro had connected APT41 to ransomware attacks on Taiwan organizations earlier in 2020. The ransomware, called ColdLock, spread via Active Directory and scheduled tasks. Further analysis found the group was lurking in target networks for months beforehand, using custom loaders and Cobalt Strike. They targeted energy, retail, telecom, and more in Southeast Asia. Infrastructure links suggest ties to Chinese espionage. APT41 has sophisticated tools and is a persistent threat, requiring robust defenses like AI-powered detection, sandboxing, and threat intelligence. In summary, the PDF covers the U.S. charges against APT41 hackers as well as previous research connecting them to wide-ranging cyberattacks and espionage, emphasizing the need for strong security measures.
