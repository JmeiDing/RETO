The PDF describes an investigation by Kaspersky Lab in 2012 into a large-scale cyberespionage network they called "Red October." The attackers targeted diplomatic, governmental, and scientific organizations, mainly in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, since at least 2007. The attackers delivered malware via spearphishing emails with malicious attachments exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. Once executed, the malware contacted command and control servers to receive additional modules for intelligence gathering. The modules gathered files, data from mobile devices, network info, etc. and sent it encrypted to the C&C. The attackers used a complex infrastructure to hide the main C&C server, with over 60 domains and multiple proxy servers. They continuously developed new malware modules and customized attacks for different targets. Victims were found in at least 39 countries, with most infections in Switzerland, Kazakhstan, and Greece. Targets included government, military, aerospace, energy, and embassy organizations. Kaspersky concludes the attackers were Russian-speaking based on language artifacts and the registration of C&C servers. The campaign was very broad and advanced, focused on long-term intelligence gathering from high-value targets in sensitive organizations versus immediate financial gain.
