The report provides a technical analysis of the IEXPL0RE remote access trojan (RAT) used in targeted attacks against human rights organizations in 2010-2011. IEXPL0RE is delivered via spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments customized for each target. If opened, it installs multiple components to eventually download the RAT payload from a command and control server. The RAT allows the attacker full access and control over the infected system. It can log keystrokes, exfiltrate files, install new programs, activate audio/video capture, and more using 40+ commands. The report provides details on IEXPL0RE's infection process, command and control communication protocol, capabilities, and how it attempts to evade detection. Network signatures and forensic artifacts are listed to detect infection. IEXPL0RE shows sophistication in customizing attacks for human rights targets and quietly collecting data over time. The report concludes many similar APT campaigns continue to steal data using these techniques, requiring ongoing vigilance.
