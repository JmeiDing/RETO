Kaspersky researchers investigated the surveillance tool FinSpy, also called FinFisher or Wingbird, sold by Gamma Group. They found FinSpy is now using more advanced infection methods and components to avoid detection. The Windows version uses complex installers like trojanized software installers to eventually deploy the main FinSpy trojan. It can also infect using UEFI or MBR bootkits for persistence. The trojan has various modules for surveillance like keylogging, webcam access, and communications interception. FinSpy for MacOS and Linux leverage similar modular frameworks with encrypted plugins tailored for each platform. The macOS version uses persistent launch agents for startup and Linux aims for stealth. Across Windows, MacOS, and Linux, FinSpy features layered obfuscation techniques to avoid AV detection and analysis. The malware calls back to command servers to exfiltrate collected data. Kaspersky notes the shift to stealthier first stage downloaders and bootkit infections for Windows versions of FinSpy. The Linux and MacOS versions also showcase Gamma Group's continued development to support multiple platforms. Their research aims to aid further analysis and protection from this powerful commercial spyware tool.
