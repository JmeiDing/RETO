The PDF describes a UEFI bootkit named ESPecter that was discovered on a compromised machine. ESPecter has been active since at least 2012, originally operating as a bootkit for legacy BIOS systems before upgrading to target UEFI. ESPecter achieves persistence by infecting the Windows Boot Manager on the EFI System Partition (ESP) to execute malware early in the boot process before the OS loads. It can bypass Driver Signature Enforcement to load its own unsigned driver. The main components are installers, boot code, a kernel driver, and user-mode payloads. The boot code patches Windows functions to disable integrity checks and Driver Signature Enforcement. The driver injects payloads into processes. The payloads collect keystrokes, documents, screenshots and communicate with a C&C server to receive commands. Collected data is encrypted and exfiltrated. The malware uses hiding techniques, encryption, and anti-analysis features. ESPecter has espionage capabilities and appears to be used for cyberespionage objectives. It has some Chinese strings but the threat actor is unknown. Secure Boot mitigates this threat but ESPecter shows UEFI malware is moving beyond SPI flash implants.
