The document describes cyberespionage activities by a threat group tracked as Machete that has been targeting high-profile organizations in Latin America since at least 2014. Machete uses spearphishing emails containing malicious documents or links to deliver its Python-based malware to victims. It focuses on military and government entities in Venezuela, Ecuador, and other Latin American countries. The malware targets various file types, including Microsoft Office documents, backup files, database files, cryptographic keys, OpenOffice documents, vector images, and geographic information systems (topographic maps, navigation routes, etc.). The Machete group has introduced several changes to its malware since a new version was released in April 2018, making it more advanced and difficult to detect. The group steals sensitive documents from its targets, including military plans and geographic route data. It has exfiltrated gigabytes of data from over 50 compromised systems between March-May 2019. The malware features backdoor capabilities to take screenshots, log keystrokes, collect files, exfiltrate data, and retrieve additional payloads from the command and control server. Machete regularly updates its tactics, infrastructure, and malware code. The latest version uses multiple obfuscation techniques on its Python scripts and expanded communications via FTP/HTTP. The malware uses the Mozilla Location Service API for geolocation purposes, providing more accurate coordinates than other methods like IP addresses. The latest version of the Machete malware includes six backdoor components that are packed into a self-extracting file, making it even harder to detect and remove. The group leverages stolen documents as lures in phishing emails, sometimes on the same day the documents were taken from other victims. This shows their capability to quickly process and re-weaponize compromised data. While prior research has revealed details on Machete, the group remains highly active in cyberespionage against Latin American targets, particularly military and government organizations. Rapid introduction of new malware versions has allowed it to stay under the radar. Machete's continued success highlights the challenges of mitigating sophisticated, focused cyberespionage actors. Their adaptability, knowledge of targets' communication patterns, and operational security make them a persistent threat in the region.
