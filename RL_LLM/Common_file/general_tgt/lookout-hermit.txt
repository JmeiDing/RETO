The report analyzes an Android spyware named Hermit that was used to target victims in Kazakhstan and elsewhere. Hermit is developed by Italian surveillance vendor RCS Lab and a front company called Tykelab. Hermit is modular malware that downloads additional capability modules from its command and control server after initial infection. It can record audio, intercept notifications, steal data like contacts and photos, and more. Samples were found impersonating smartphone manufacturers to trick users into installing Hermit. The malware displays legitimate websites as it starts malicious background activities. In April 2022, Hermit was found targeting Kazakhstan in the wake of anti-government protests being suppressed. The command and control IP tied back to an ISP in the capital. Prior infections were seen in Syria and Italy. The report examines RCS Lab's controversial global spyware dealings with authoritarian regimes. Technical analysis reveals Hermit's advanced capabilities like device exploitation, encrypted communications, configurable parameters, and steps to evade detection and analysis. The report concludes that spyware like Hermit poses a powerful threat, but can be defeated through awareness, application vetting, device hygiene, and dedicated mobile security solutions. In summary, the report provides an in-depth profile of the sophisticated Hermit spyware, its developers, infection tactics, and use in targeted surveillance operations globally.
