The PDF discusses the Cobalt Strike penetration testing toolkit and how Cisco Talos analyzed it to develop detections. Cobalt Strike is made up of different modules that fulfill specific functions like command and control, stealth, and reconnaissance. The paper provides an overview of Cobalt Strike including listeners for command and control, web management for hosting payloads and attacks, and reporting features. It then analyzes the different attack modules Cobalt Strike offers such as raw shellcode generator, executable generator, HTML application attacks, scripted web delivery, signed applet attacks, smart applet attacks, and system profiling. For each module, the PDF explains how the attack works technically, shows examples of the attack code, and discusses how Talos researchers analyzed the attacks to develop signatures for the Snort and ClamAV engines. The analysis examines elements like stagers, beacon configuration, C2 communication, vulnerability exploitation, and obfuscation techniques. Based on understanding how each module operates, Talos crafted precise Snort and ClamAV rules to detect Cobalt Strike while avoiding false positives. In total, Talos created over 50 new signatures covering raw shellcode, executables, web delivery, HTML application attacks, Java applets, and profiling. By thoroughly analyzing Cobalt Strike's components, Talos was able to provide robust detection for this popular penetration testing toolkit while it continues to evolve.
