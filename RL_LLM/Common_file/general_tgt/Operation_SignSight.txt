The cybersecurity firm ESET uncovered a supply chain cyberattack called Operation SignSight that targeted the Vietnam Government Certification Authority (VGCA) website from late July to mid August 2020. The VGCA is responsible for issuing digital certificates needed to digitally sign documents in Vietnam. The attackers compromised the VGCA website and trojanized two VGCA software installers that could be downloaded from there. The trojanized installers included a backdoor known as PhantomNet or SManager. When executed, the installers would install the legitimate VGCA software as well as the backdoor. This made the compromise harder to detect, since the legitimate software was still installed. PhantomNet would communicate with command and control servers using HTTPS and implement certificate pinning to avoid detection. It had capabilities to collect system information, proxy settings, and user credentials. It could also download additional plugins, one of which was found to be focused on lateral movement using tools like Mimikatz. The goal of the attack was likely to compromise users who trust and download software from the VGCA website. Since VGCA issues crucial digital certificates, its users are likely to be high-value targets like government agencies. By hijacking the supply chain of legitimate VGCA software, the attackers could silently compromise these targets when they installed what they thought was legitimate software. Supply chain attacks like this exploit the trust in software sources like government websites to hide malware. They are challenging to detect since the malicious code is concealed within legitimate code. ESET uncovered this attack in early December 2020 and notified VGCA, but the compromised installers were available for download for several weeks prior to that. The incident highlights the risk of supply chain attacks against trusted software sources and the importance of securing software distribution channels.
