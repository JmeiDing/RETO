The blog post describes a new phishing campaign attributed to the Russia-linked threat actor Gamaredon APT targeting Ukrainian government entities. Emails contain weaponized Office documents that download RAR archives with LNK files to deploy next-stage PowerShell scripts. The scripts collect system info, take screenshots, and fetch additional payloads from the command server. The group uses phishing documents containing lures related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine to gain initial access. Once inside, the group deploys information-stealing malware and additional payloads as directed by the attackers. The latest campaign involves using custom-made information stealer implants that exfiltrate files of interest and deploy additional payloads. One payload is a custom infostealer that exfiltrates specific file types and can deploy extra scripts or binaries. The phishing lures reference the war in Ukraine. The tactics, techniques, infrastructure, and malware overlap with previous Gamaredon activity exclusively targeting Ukraine. The post analyzes the initial access vectors, attack chain, payloads, and command and control. It covers detection capabilities, protections, queries, and IOCs available to defend against this threat. The campaign signals continued espionage motivations by Gamaredon against Ukrainian interests amidst the ongoing conflict.
