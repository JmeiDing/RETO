The PDF describes the story of Jean-Pierre Lesueur, a 22-year-old French programmer who created the remote access trojan (RAT) called Dark Comet. Though intended as a tool to demonstrate Lesueur's coding abilities, Dark Comet ended up being used by the Syrian government to spy on activists fighting the regime. Dark Comet is designed to evade detection by antivirus software and can be used for both spying on computers and stealing passwords. Dark Comet has capabilities like a keylogger, video/audio recording, and stealing passwords. It can be installed silently on a victim's computer if they open a Trojaned file made to look legitimate. Once infected, hackers use that computer to try to infect the victim's contacts. Researchers identified Dark Comet on computers of Syrian activists starting in late 2011. It was part of an escalating cyberespionage campaign targeting critics of President Bashar al-Assad. Activists believe stolen information led to many arrests. As Dark Comet's role in Syria became public, pressure mounted on Lesueur. He initially released a removal tool but feared legal repercussions and pulled Dark Comet in June 2012. The arrest days earlier of a developer of similar RAT malware called Blackshades contributed to his decision. Lesueur says he never intended illegal uses and was not motivated by money. He wanted to build his reputation in the hacker scene. He expresses regret that Dark Comet was misused, saying he would not have created it if he knew it would be used by a government for spying. The article examines the unintended consequences when hacking tools built for proof of skills or entertainment end up repurposed for malicious ends by bad actors. It highlights the abilities of RATs and the role of Dark Comet in Syria's cyberespionage operations.
