The PDF describes malware called Gh0stTimes that has been used in attacks by a threat actor group called BlackTech against Japanese organizations since 2018. Gh0stTimes is a customized version of the Gh0st RAT malware. It communicates with command and control (C2) servers using a custom protocol. It has an authentication system to only allow connections from certain IDs. Communication is encrypted after authentication. It sends infected host information like hostname, username, processor name to the C2 server. Commands are encrypted and compressed before being sent. Commands include file operations, remote shell execution, C2 redirection, and proxy functions. Gh0stTimes has some dummy code that may make analysis more difficult. A control panel named Times v1.2 was found that can be used to control infected systems. In addition to Gh0stTimes, BlackTech uses other malware and exploits on compromised servers. A list of hashes and C2 domains is provided. JPCERT/CC plans to continue monitoring and analyzing BlackTech activities. Organizations are advised to ensure their systems are not communicating with the identified C2 servers.
