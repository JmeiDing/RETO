The document analyzes recent activity of the South American cyber threat actor APT-C-36/Blind Eagle that conducts long-running spam campaigns. APT-C-36 sends phishing emails impersonating tax agencies or containing fake personal photos to targets in South America. Emails contain links to downloads. Links in emails redirect through URL shorteners to archives containing remote access trojans (RATs) like BitRAT. BitRAT uses the Camellia cipher and computational steps to decrypt its configuration and C2 communication. APT-C-36 primarily targets government, financial, and healthcare entities in Colombia and other South American countries. The group constantly changes tactics and payloads but aims to compromise targets likely for financial gain. Updated security tools can help detect the threat.
