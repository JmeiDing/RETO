The PDF describes research by NCC Group tracking a peer-to-peer (P2P) network used by the threat actor TA505, known for distribution of banking trojans and ransomware. The P2P network includes a downloader, signed driver, and node tool that communicate via UDP. The node tool exchanges records between peers. The programming style matches that of the GraceRAT malware used by TA505. The downloader fetches the other components from a command and control server, decrypts them, and installs them. The signed driver filters system information to avoid detection, injects the node tool payload, and reports back to the C2. The node tool communicates with other peers to exchange records containing metadata and encrypted payloads. The records appear to be used to distribute updates. While no interaction with GraceRAT was observed, the attribution to GraceRAT developers is based on code similarities. The research provides indicators of compromise on the components and notes that TA505 has shifted focus to ransomware operations for financial gain. The P2P network allows TA505 to distribute tools and updates while avoiding centralized infrastructure that could be taken down. The tools evolve but TA505 continues to pose a threat by compromising corporate networks.
