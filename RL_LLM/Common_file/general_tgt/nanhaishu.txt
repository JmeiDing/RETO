The PDF analyzes a malware called NanHaiShu used in targeted cyberespionage campaigns related to the South China Sea dispute. The remote access trojan is spread via phishing emails containing macro-enabled Office docs. If macros are enabled, it installs persistence and gathers system info to send to a command server. Targets of NanHaiShu include the Philippines Department of Justice, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit organizers, and a law firm involved in South China Sea arbitration cases. Targeting, code similarities to Chinese sites, and infrastructure links indicate the threat actor is likely Chinese government affiliated. Campaigns began in 2015 and remain ongoing. NanHaiShu allows attackers to remotely control infected systems, download additional scripts, and exfiltrate sensitive documents. Its capabilities could enable extensive cyberespionage. In summary, the report profiles NanHaiShu as a sophisticated malware used to spy on entities involved in South China Sea legal disputes, tied to a Chinese-linked advanced persistent threat actor through technical analysis.
