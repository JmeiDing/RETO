The PDF describes the activities of a cybercriminal group called TA2541 that has been targeting aviation, aerospace, transportation, manufacturing, and defense industries since at least 2017. TA2541 uses themes related to aviation and transportation in its phishing emails to distribute remote access trojans (RATs) like AsyncRAT. The group has consistently used the same tactics, techniques and procedures over time. It sends emails with links or attachments that install VBScripts, which then pull down the RAT payload from sites like Pastebin. TA2541 briefly used COVID-19 themes in 2020 but quickly went back to aviation and transportation lures. The group establishes persistence on infected machines using scheduled tasks, registry edits, and VBS startup scripts. Over a dozen different RATs have been observed from the group over the years, with AsyncRAT being the most common recently. Infrastructure patterns link campaigns together, like "kimjoy" in domain names and email addresses. The group uses dynamic DNS and common hosting providers. Campaigns distribute hundreds to thousands of messages to a wide range of targets globally. Aviation, aerospace and transportation are hit most frequently. Proofpoint expects TA2541 to continue using the same techniques seen historically. The report provides indicators of compromise like VBS hashes and C2 domains to help detect activity.
