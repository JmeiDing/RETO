The cybersecurity company Unit 42 discovered a new variant of the Poison Ivy remote access trojan (RAT) malware being used in targeted attacks against pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. This new variant, dubbed "SPIVY," uses a technique called DLL sideloading to load malicious code and evade detection. The SPIVY malware was distributed via weaponized documents exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability. The documents contained Hong Kong political themes as decoys. Once executed, the malware drops a self-extracting RAR archive containing three files used in the infection process. SPIVY maintains code similarities to previous Poison Ivy versions but modifies the network communication protocol in an attempt to avoid detection. The malware is built as shellcode, encoded, and loaded by a signed legitimate executable and DLL through DLL sideloading. The decoy documents reference recent Hong Kong political events and organizations, pretending to be invitations to press conferences and commemoration events. This indicates the attacks are targeting Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. Poison Ivy has historically been a popular RAT used by both unsophisticated and advanced threat actors. The emergence of this new SPIVY variant after years of little Poison Ivy development suggests threat actors are updating old malware to evade defenses. Unit 42 recommends organizations defend against SPIVY using specific threat prevention signatures and monitor networks for related activity.
