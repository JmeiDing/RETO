The payload in this PDF is a malicious code injection attack targeting the Notepad.exe process in Windows. The attackers inject a piece of shellcode into the notepad.exe process. The infection starts with the Nimbda loader written in Nim language. This is bundled with a Chinese SMS bomber tool. When executed, Nimbda drops the SMS bomber executable and runs it. Separately, Nimbda injects code into a launched notepad.exe process. The injected shellcode reaches out to a command and control (C2) server on GitHub/Gitee to fetch an obfuscated IP address and then run a three-tier execution flow to obfuscate the IP address and decrypt the EULA.MD file containing an obfuscated IP address. The initial shellcode is first deobfuscated using a Python script, which performs various operations such as AES decryption and string substitutions. The deobfuscated shellcode then downloads an encrypted executable from GitHub or Gitee repositories and runs it through hollowing process via DLLhost.exe. This deobfuscated executable is an improved version of the Yahoyah malware that collects WiFi SSID and other system info. Yahoyah sends the collected data to the C2 server. Yahoyah sets up persistence by registering a DLL that will download another image from C2. This image contains steganographically encoded final payload - the TClient backdoor. The extracted TClient payload is executed via the StartWork export. TClient provides backdoor access and control over the compromised system.
