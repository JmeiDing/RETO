The report by Trend Micro details the activities of a cyberespionage group they call DRBControl, which targets gambling and betting companies primarily in Southeast Asia. The group uses spear-phishing emails with weaponized documents to gain initial access. Once inside a network, they use custom backdoors like "Type 1" and "Type 2," along with other tools like PlugX, HyperBro, and Cobalt Strike for further exploitation. The Type 1 backdoor has plugin capabilities and uses Dropbox for command-and-control. The Type 2 backdoor focuses on keylogging and credential theft. DRBControl organizes stolen data based on victim network and exfiltrates databases, source code, and sensitive documents. While DRBControl was unknown to Trend Micro before this analysis, connections were found between their tactics, infrastructure, and malware and known groups like Winnti and Emissary Panda. The report provides technical details on the group's backdoors, command and control infrastructure, and post-exploitation tools. It also offers mitigation advice for companies to defend against similar targeted attacks. Overall, the report profiles the newly identified DRBControl cyberespionage group and their ongoing campaign against Asian gambling firms to steal valuable data through malware and focused social engineering tactics. It provides in-depth analysis of their operations for defenders and researchers.
