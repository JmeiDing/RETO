Security researchers at Lookout Threat Lab have discovered a new Android rooting malware campaign called AbstractEmu. The malware was distributed through 19 apps on Google Play, Amazon Appstore, Samsung Galaxy Store and other third-party stores. Seven apps contained rooting functionality and were able to gain privileged access on Android devices. AbstractEmu uses sophisticated techniques like code abstraction, anti-emulation checks, and burner details to avoid detection. It exploits vulnerabilities from 2019-2020 to target as many users as possible across 17 countries, with a likely financial motivation. The apps disguise themselves as utilities like password managers or system tools and have legitimate functionality. Once installed, AbstractEmu checks if the device is real, communicates with a C2 server, and can execute commands received. It gathers extensive device and app data to determine further actions. The key malicious functionality is silently rooting the device using embedded exploit binaries and tools. This grants intrusive permissions and capabilities to stealthily install the "Settings Storage" app. While Lookout was unable to determine the final payload, they assess AbstractEmu is likely a well-resourced, financially motivated actor with potential parallels to banking trojans. The malware exemplifies the rare but dangerous threats from rooting Android devices. Lookout recommends keeping devices updated, using official app stores, and having dedicated mobile security to stay protected.
