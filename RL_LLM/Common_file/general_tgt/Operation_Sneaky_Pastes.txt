The PDF describes the activities of a politically-motivated cyberthreat group called Gaza Cybergang, which targets the Middle East and North Africa region. The group conducts phishing campaigns using disposable email and domains to spread malware to victims. Their targets include embassies, government entities, media, activists, healthcare organizations, and banks. The group uses multiple stages of malware to evade detection, often hosting early stages on paste sites before installing remote access trojans (RATs) on victim machines. The RATs search for and exfiltrate documents, screenshots, software info, and other data of interest. This is compressed, encrypted, and uploaded to command and control servers. Three subgroups within Gaza Cybergang have been identified, with Group 1 being the least sophisticated. The PDF provides details on Group 1's tactics, techniques, infrastructure analysis, and victimology from 2018-2019. Over 240 victims across 39 countries were documented, with the Palestinian Territories being the most targeted. Indicator of compromise details are provided, including MD5 hashes, domain names, IP addresses, and filenames associated with the group's activities. The report concludes that the group will likely intensify attacks and rely more on advanced tools and procedures going forward.
