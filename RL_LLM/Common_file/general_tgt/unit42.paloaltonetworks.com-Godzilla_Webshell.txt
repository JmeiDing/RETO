The report details an exploitation campaign targeting vulnerabilities in Zoho's ManageEngine products to compromise at least 9 organizations globally. The threat actors exploited CVE-2021-40539, an authentication bypass vulnerability, to deploy a dropper and Godzilla webshell on the servers. The Godzilla webshell allows them to execute commands and maintain persistence. In some cases, the actors also installed a customized version of the NGLite backdoor. NGLite uses the decentralized NKN network for command and control. After gaining access, the actors focused on gathering sensitive files, credentials, and accessing domain controllers. A new credential harvesting tool called KdcSponge was installed on domain controllers. It hooks into the LSASS process and Kerberos functions to capture credentials of users authenticating to the domain. The actors used the access and tools to gather and exfiltrate sensitive documents. Tactics like the toolset, targeting of domain controllers, and exfiltration methods suggest potential alignment with threat group Emissary Panda. Protection methods include threat prevention rules, endpoint detection, and network monitoring for the indicators of compromise provided. The report aims to provide insight into the latest tactics and tools used in this still active campaign.
