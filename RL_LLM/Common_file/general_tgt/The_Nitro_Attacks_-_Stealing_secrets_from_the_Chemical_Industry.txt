The document discusses a targeted cyberattack campaign called "Nitro" directed primarily at private chemical companies to steal intellectual property and proprietary information. The attacks started in late July 2011 and continued through mid-September 2011, though the attackers' infrastructure was active as early as April 2011. The attackers sent malicious emails with attachments to employees at the targeted companies. The emails pretended to be meeting invitations or software updates. The attachments installed a remote access Trojan called PoisonIvy when opened. PoisonIvy contacted a command and control server and gathered information like IP addresses, names of other systems on the network, and password hashes. The attackers used this initial access to traverse the network further, aiming to gain domain admin credentials and access systems with valuable intellectual property. They exfiltrated the targeted data to internal staging servers before sending it out of the compromised network. At least 29 chemical companies were targeted, along with 19 others primarily in defense. Infected computers were located globally, though mainly in the US, Bangladesh, and UK. The companies' headquarters were largely in the US and UK. The attacks were traced back to a virtual private server in the US owned by an individual in China. His role is unclear, though he offered hacking services when asked about his skills. Other groups also started targeting the chemical companies around the same time using different tactics. The connections between the groups are uncertain. The report concludes many targeted attacks are occurring weekly against private industry, military, government, and human rights groups.
