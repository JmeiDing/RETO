The PDF discusses the Linux malware Fysbis, which is used by the cyberespionage group Sofacy (also known as APT28 and Sednit). Fysbis is a modular trojan/backdoor for Linux that can install itself with or without root privileges. The PDF analyzes 3 samples of Fysbis from late 2014, early 2015, and late 2015. It examines the installation paths, command and control domains, capabilities, and other characteristics of each sample. Key findings: Fysbis uses common legitimate service names as cover for its installation paths, such as rsyncd, ksysdefd, dbus-inotifier. The C2 domains and IPs tie back to known Sofacy infrastructure. Azureon-line[.]com, 193.169.244[.]190, 111.90.148[.]148 were seen in late 2014. 198.105.125[.]74 was seen in early 2015 and associated with the CHOPSTICK malware. Mozilla-plugins[.]com was a new C2 domain seen in late 2015. Analysis of strings in the samples revealed functionality like command execution, file download, and remote shell. The non-stripped sample gave more insight through symbolic info. Obfuscation of the installation paths and C2 information evolved over the samples via encoded byte arrays and rolling XOR decryption. The simple but effective nature of Fysbis shows APT groups don't always need advanced malware to achieve their goals. The PDF emphasizes that Linux malware exists and defenders need Linux expertise/visibility to detect threats. IPS signatures, domain blocking, and other Anti-APT protections are discussed. In summary, the PDF provides an in-depth look at the Fysbis malware from the Sofacy APT group, its evolution and detection over time, and the need for Linux threat awareness.
