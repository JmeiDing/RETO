The PDF describes an analysis by Palo Alto Networks of two malware families, PlugX and Elirks, that were found during the investigation of a recent attack on a Japanese business. Elirks is a less well-known backdoor Trojan that was first discovered in 2010. It is primarily used to steal information from compromised systems and Palo Alto Networks mainly observes it being used in attacks in East Asia. A unique feature of Elirks is that it retrieves its command and control server address from pre-determined microblog or social media accounts set up by the attackers. The PDF outlines similarities between this recent attack and previous Elirks campaigns Palo Alto Networks has observed, including: - Spear phishing emails with PDF attachments masquerading as aviation related content like e-tickets. The PDFs exploit vulnerabilities like CVE-2011-0611 to install Elirks. - File names like "E-TKT" used for both the recent attack and previous campaigns going back to 2012. - Targeting of aviation related organizations and government entities in East Asia. While there is no definitive evidence that the same actor is behind both the recent attack and older campaigns, the similarities in tactics, techniques, and procedures point to an ongoing cyber espionage operation in the region that leverages Elirks. Palo Alto Networks suggests continuing to monitor these threat actors and has implemented protections in their products, like WildFire detection, malicious C2 blocking, and AutoFocus tagging to help customers guard against Elirks.
