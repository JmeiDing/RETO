The document analyzes the worming modules used by the DirtyMoe crypto-mining malware to spread itself. DirtyMoe is typically deployed via phishing campaigns, malvertising, or compromised software installers. The worming modules allow it to self-replicate without user interaction. The research focuses on the worming module's kill chain and procedures used to launch/control the module through the DirtyMoe service. The modules have a reconnaissance phase where IP addresses are generated to target. The algorithm cleverly distributes addresses globally based on the module's location. The weaponization phase prepares exploits for vulnerable services discovered during reconnaissance. In the delivery phase, the exploits are sent to the targets to achieve remote code execution. New DirtyMoe instances are installed on compromised machines. The modules abuse several known vulnerabilities, including EternalBlue, deserialization bugs, and an Oracle WebLogic exploit. Other attacks involve brute forcing weak passwords on SMB file shares, SQL Server, and the Windows Service Control Manager. The modules can scan and exploit up to 6,000 IP addresses per second. An IP address backlog and specialized queues are used to manage discovered potential victims and repeatedly attack them on hourly and daily schedules. This reduces the risk of detection. A 100,000 word password dictionary facilitates credential stuffing attacks. One module under development was found that may indicate intentions to target PHP, Java deserialization, and Oracle WebLogic in the future. The C&C servers can remotely determine which modules get deployed on infected hosts. DirtyMoe's worming capabilities make it highly adept at spreading quickly and infiltrating both public internet hosts and private networks behind firewalls.
