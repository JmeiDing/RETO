The report from ClearSky Cyber Security provides analysis of an Iranian cyberespionage campaign called Fox Kitten that has been active since at least 2017. The campaign targets companies worldwide, especially in IT, telecom, oil/gas, aviation, and government sectors. The attackers gain initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in VPN services like Pulse Secure, Fortinet, and Palo Alto. Once inside, they use privilege escalation tools and credentials dumping to maintain access. Self-developed backdoors open SSH tunnels for RDP connections back to the attackers. Webshells, reverse proxies, and DNS tunneling are used for command and control. The malware tracks its own state to introduce long delays before taking actions to avoid detection. Stolen files are examined and filtered manually before exfiltration via archives. Many sophisticated techniques are exhibited, including 1-day exploit development, encrypted communications, modularity, and evasion. The report attributes the campaign to the advanced Iranian APT groups APT34/OilRig based on TTP overlaps and infrastructure reuse. There are also possible links to APT33 and APT39, pointing to collaboration between these groups. While APT33 is known for wiper malware, the Fox Kitten focus appears to be espionage and supply chain attacks. The report provides extensive technical analysis of the malware components and infrastructure. It includes recommendations for securing VPNs, limiting permissions, monitoring for IOCs, and patching rapidly. Comprehensive indicators, ATT&CK mappings, and insights into the attackers are provided to aid defense.
