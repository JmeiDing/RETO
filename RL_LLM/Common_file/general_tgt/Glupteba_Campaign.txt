Glupteba is an older botnet malware that has been distributed recently through malvertising and leveraged to build a proxy network. Analysis found the Glupteba dropper now also downloads a browser stealer component to harvest sensitive browser data and a router exploiter using CVE-2018-14847 to compromise MikroTik routers. Compromised routers are configured as SOCKS proxies to relay malicious traffic, expanding the Glupteba botnet. Observed traffic includes spam campaigns and suspicious Instagram connections. An interesting feature allows the malware to retrieve new C&C domains encrypted in Bitcoin blockchain transactions, making it more resilient. The continual evolution of Glupteba with new components and techniques like the Bitcoin C&C update shows the malware authors are dedicated to keeping it an active threat. Recommended defensive measures include multilayered security, patching vulnerable devices, monitoring network traffic for signs of compromise, and deploying additional protections. In summary, the post analyzes the latest innovations in the Glupteba malware operation, including router exploitation for proxying malicious traffic and use of the Bitcoin blockchain for resilient C&C.
