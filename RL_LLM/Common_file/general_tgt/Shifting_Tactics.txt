The report describes a years-long cyberespionage campaign by a group called Scarlet Mimic targeting Tibetan and Uyghur communities. The group has continuously adapted its tactics over time in response to increased security awareness in the Tibetan community. Initially, Scarlet Mimic relied on document-based malware using exploits for common vulnerabilities. Email lures were customized for intended victims. The malware connected to command and control infrastructure on dynamic DNS domains. In recent attacks, the group has shifted to conventional phishing tactics. The phishing emails reflect knowledge of community activities and share links to Google Drive instead of attachments. Some old malware command and control infrastructure has been repurposed to host the phishing pages. This shows the group failing to properly compartmentalize operations. The phishing campaign was active from November-December 2015, with climate change advocacy as a theme used in lures. This tracks real activities in the Tibetan community at that time. The report speculates the shift in tactics may be due to increased use of cloud storage, detections of malware by antivirus products, and difficulties getting attachments opened. Targeted users are advised to use two-factor authentication, password managers, and be cautious of unsolicited emails. The attackers' ability to quickly adapt methods highlights the persistent threat faced by the Tibetan community.
