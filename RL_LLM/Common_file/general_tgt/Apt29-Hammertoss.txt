This PDF document is about a cyber threat group called APT29, also known as HAMMERTOHS. The group is capable of using stealthy tactics to cover their tracks and execute commands on victim networks. They use a tool called HAMMERTOSS, which is a Russian-developed malware that uses steganography to hide encrypted data within images. HAMMERTOSS visits GitHub to download an image containing encrypted data, and then processes the decrypted data to obtain commands. These commands can be used to conduct reconnaissance, execute commands via PowerShell, or upload data to cloud storage services. APT29's operators choose specific Twitter handles to communicate with HAMMERTOSS, and they typically configure HAMMERTOSS to communicate within certain restrictions, such as only checking the Twitter handle on weekdays or after a specified start date. This allows the malware to blend in to "normal" traffic during the victim's workweek or to remain dormant for a period of time before activating.
