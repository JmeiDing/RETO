The report analyzes activity by a Chinese threat actor group called Evil Eye targeting iOS devices used by Uyghurs. Evil Eye previously targeted Android and iOS but went dormant after public reporting in 2019. The group resurfaced in early 2020 with updated iOS exploits and an updated iOS malware implant called INSOMNIA. The attackers compromised multiple Uyghur-themed websites to embed iframes loading the exploitation framework IRONSQUIRREL. This targeted iOS 12.3 to 12.3.2 via a WebKit vulnerability patched in iOS 12.4. If successful, it installed INSOMNIA. Analysis of INSOMNIA shows it is an updated version of previous iOS implants tied to Evil Eye. Updates include C2 over HTTPS, certificate pinning, basic string obfuscation, and targeting apps like Signal and ProtonMail. It exfiltrates data from apps and the iOS system. The exploit chain and malware show continuous development of iOS capabilities by Evil Eye. Although the exploited vulnerabilities are patched, a considerable number of devices may still be vulnerable based on iOS version adoption rates. This demonstrates an ongoing campaign by a Chinese group to surveil the Uyghur ethnic group.
