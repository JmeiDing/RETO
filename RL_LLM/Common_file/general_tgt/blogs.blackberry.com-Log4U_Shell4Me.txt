The BlackBerry research and incident response teams have found evidence linking the initial access broker (IAB) group Prophet Spider to exploitation of the Log4j vulnerability in VMware Horizon. Log4Shell is a combination of remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in Apache Log4j, a popular logging framework. The severity of the exploit has caused widespread exploitation, with attackers using it to install cryptocurrency mining software or attempt ransomware and extortion. Prophet Spider is known to compromise networks and later sell access to ransomware operators. The exploitation can be detected by monitoring child processes of the ws_TomcatService.exe parent process, which spawns cmd.exe or powershell.exe. The threat actors use encoded PowerShell commands to download payloads such as cryptocurrency miners or Cobalt Strike beacons. They also inject webshells into the absg-worker.js file and restart the VMBlastSG service to maintain persistence. The attackers use tactics, techniques and procedures associated with Prophet Spider, including storing files in C:\Windows\Temp\7fde\ and using the wget.bin executable. After establishing persistence, they harvest credentials and enumerate the network. Defenders can mitigate these threats through patch management, vulnerability scanning, monitoring, threat intelligence, and AI-based endpoint protection to quickly detect and respond to intrusions. The indicators of compromise provided can help organizations determine if they have been compromised.
