The document analyzes malware used in watering hole attacks on financial institutions attributed to the Lazarus cybercrime group. The malware uses false flags and misleading translations to disguise its origin and evade detection. The attacks start by compromising websites to serve exploits that download malware. The malware stages use encoded shellcode and downloading of components to complicate analysis. Decoding reveals loosely translated Russian words likely meant to mislead investigators into thinking the malware is from Russia. The multi-stage process ultimately leads to execution of unknown final payloads on target systems. The false flags and evolving techniques aim to avoid detection, but in-depth analysis enables attribution and highlights the need for continued monitoring of Lazarus campaigns. Defensive recommendations include implementing provided indicators of compromise.
