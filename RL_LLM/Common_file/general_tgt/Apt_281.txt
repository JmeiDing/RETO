The PDF discusses cyberattacks attributed to APT28, a prolific Russian hacking group also known as Sofacy. APT28 is known for breaching government, military, financial, and media targets worldwide, stealing credentials and data and inflicting major financial losses. The security firm root9B claims to have uncovered APT28 staging a large-scale spearphishing attack targeting financial institutions in April 2015. By analyzing server infrastructure and persona information used to register domains, root9B connected the attack preparations to previous APT28 campaigns dating back to 2014. Root9B shared technical details on the attack infrastructure, including command and control servers and previously unknown malware hashes, with government authorities. The report speculates APT28 may use spearphishing emails containing malware to harvest banking credentials or disrupt financial networks. While the vector of the impending attack is uncertain, root9B assesses APT28 likely registered lookalike domains mimicking their targets over many months to stage malware and servers. Ultimately, spearphishing emails would likely be sent to targets in an attempt to get them to enter credentials on fake banking sites, enabling credential theft and further system infiltration. Overall, the report highlights root9B's claim of an unprecedented early warning of an APT28 cyberattack campaign targeting the financial sector, enabled by identifying a crucial mistake in the threat actor's typical tradecraft.
