The document analyzes a remote access trojan (RAT) malware named KONNI that has been active for over 3 years but avoided scrutiny until now. KONNI initially functioned as an information stealer in 2014 and 2016 campaigns themed around North Korean tensions. It evolved to include remote administration capabilities like arbitrary command execution by 2017. The initial infection vector is a spear phishing email containing a .src file that displays a decoy document. KONNI malware files are dropped and executed. Technical analysis examines KONNI's evolution across 4 campaigns in terms of architecture, command and control servers, supported features like keylogging and screenshots, and use of decoy documents. Attribution is implied to be North Korean based on decoy content, but not definitively stated. Decoy documents in 2017 target public organizations and contacts related to North Korea. KONNI shows increasing sophistication over time in coding, evasion techniques, social engineering tactics, and integration of features. The report aims to raise awareness of an under the radar threat that continues to be actively developed. Indicators of compromise, detection methods, and related samples are provided to help organizations check for and defend against KONNI intrusions. In summary, the report uncovers a previously unscrutinized RAT that has evolved over multiple campaigns to target public and private sector victims with North Korea ties.
