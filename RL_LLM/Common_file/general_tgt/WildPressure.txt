The document describes a new cyberespionage campaign named WildPressure that was discovered in August 2019. The campaign distributes a custom C++ malware called Milum that has targeted organizations in the Middle East, some related to the industrial sector. Key points about WildPressure: - First seen in May 2019, uses rented VPS servers and domains registered anonymously for infrastructure. - Milum malware versions suggest it is in early development (v1.0.1). Code shows plans for non-C++ versions. - Encrypted C2 communications use RC4 algorithm with different keys per victim. JSON used for configuration and C&C. - Gathers system info and can execute commands, drop files, list directories, etc. Uses HTTP POST requests to beacon to C2. - No code similarities to known groups. Appears targeted, with victim IDs in code like "HatLandid3". - Mostly seen in the Middle East, targeting industrial entities. Sinkholing shows majority of infections in the region. - Authors unknown. Tactics appear common, not strongly attributable to a known group yet. Could be emerging actor. In summary, WildPressure is a new espionage campaign likely focused on the Middle East industrial sector using the Milum malware. While still in early stages, it demonstrates sophisticated capabilities and remains an active threat. The targets and authors are still unclear, but it warrants monitoring as a potential new cyber espionage actor.
