The document analyzes a new malware campaign spreading the Adwind remote access trojan (RAT) that is targeting the petroleum industry in the US. The malware samples are recently hosted on servers belonging to Westnet, an Australian ISP. The malware has multiple stages of obfuscation using nested jar files and encryption to try to evade detection. Once executed, it achieves persistence, disables security services, and extracts sensitive data. The core RAT functionality is contained in a DLL loaded by one of the jar files. The RAT can capture webcam images, scan drives for specific file types, inject into other processes, monitor system status, and exfiltrate data to its command and control server located at 185.205.210.48. It supports Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Analysis reveals the malware has relatively low detection rates on VirusTotal indicating the attackers have developed effective obfuscation techniques. The campaign uses multiple Westnet user accounts to distribute the malware from web pages hosted in the last month. Indicators of compromise are provided including hashes, IP address, and URLs found distributing the malware. Netskope detects the malware as ByteCode-JAVA.Trojan.Kryptik and Gen:Variant.Application.Agentus.1. This appears to be an active campaign against the petroleum industry likely focused on data theft.
