The report analyzes activity by the APT group APT15 who compromised a company providing services to the UK government. Two new backdoors used by APT15 were discovered - RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS. RoyalCLI injects commands into the Windows command prompt. RoyalDNS uses DNS for C&C. APT15 used Mimikatz to steal credentials and a VPN certificate to maintain access. Over 200 commands executed by APT15 were recovered and decoded to understand their TTPs. APT15 relied on custom and built-in Windows tools to extract documents and data from the network.
