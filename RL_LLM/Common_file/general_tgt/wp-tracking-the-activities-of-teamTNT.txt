The PDF is a report from Trend Micro about a malicious hacking group called TeamTNT. TeamTNT is a group of at least 12 people, likely German-native speakers, who hack systems to steal credentials and deploy cryptocurrency miners. TeamTNT targets Linux environments and cloud infrastructures. They use scanners to find vulnerable systems, then deploy payloads like credential stealers for SSH, AWS, Docker, and more. They also deploy cryptocurrency miners, IRC bots for command and control, and rootkits like Diamorphine for stealth. TeamTNT runs campaigns with names like Covid-19, Black-T, Kinsing Killer, and AWS Stealer. The group evolves their tactics, using advanced techniques like searching for misconfigurations instead of exploits. In 2020-2021, TeamTNT increasingly focused on stealing cloud credentials and mining cryptocurrency in the cloud. The impact of TeamTNT's cryptojacking can be high. Based on observed wallet IDs, Trend Micro estimates TeamTNT mined over 17 Monero coins worth around $3,800. But the electricity cost to mine that amount would be around $12,000. Stolen cloud credentials could also let TeamTNT access confidential data or install more malware. Trend Micro recommends security practices like least privilege access, private key SSH authentication, patching, and using cloud-focused security solutions. They also provide technical details on TeamTNT's malware like IRC bots, credential stealers, and the Diamorphine rootkit.
