The cybercrime group behind the TrickBot malware has been enhancing its techniques to evade security controls and analysis. TrickBot is used primarily for online banking fraud through man-in-the-browser attacks that modify transactions. To avoid detection, TrickBot has implemented several defensive layers: Injections are delivered server-side rather than stored locally, making analysis harder. A JS loader fetches injections from the command and control server using referrer policies to send target info. Secure HTTPS communication with certificate hooking hides C2 traffic. Fingerprint data is collected and sent to the C2. Anti-debugging techniques like triggering browser crashes by overloading memory aim to hinder analysis. Checks for code beautification are used as a trigger. Obfuscation through minification, dead code, and other tactics conceal the true purpose of the injected code. Encoding, string extraction, and complex representations are used. TrickBot continues to be a major threat, facilitating ransomware, data theft, and financial fraud. Defense requires a combination of user training, email security, access controls, segmentation, monitoring, and data protection strategies.
