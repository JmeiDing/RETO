The report analyzes malware tools developed by a Chinese hacking group APT3, also known as UPS Team or Buckeye. It compares their tools to exploits developed by the NSA's Equation Group. - APT3 developed an exploitation tool called Bemstour that makes use of a vulnerability similar to the NSA's EternalRomance exploit. Bemstour combines this exploit with a 0-day info leak vulnerability found by APT3. - The report speculates that APT3 recreated its exploit based on network traffic captured during an Equation Group attack that was monitored by APT3. Evidence includes hardcoded SMB packet values and other artifacts in Bemstour. - APT3 appears to have obtained a version of the Equation Group's DoublePulsar implant and incorporated it into Bemstour, with some custom crypter modifications. This allows Bemstour to inject kernel payloads. - Bemstour's info leak exploit allowing it to target newer Windows versions implies significant reverse engineering of Windows SMB drivers by APT3. This suggests an exploit arms race between the US and China. - The report provides technical details on how Bemstour exploits systems, its command and control infrastructure, and similarities & differences compared to NSA exploits. - The level of vulnerability research and recreate of NSA tools indicates skilled malware development capabilities by APT3/Buckeye. It highlights the cyber arms race between top threat actors.
