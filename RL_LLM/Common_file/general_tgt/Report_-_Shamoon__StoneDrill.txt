The document analyzes two wiper malware campaigns called Shamoon and StoneDrill that targeted organizations in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East starting in November 2016. Shamoon is a highly destructive wiper that renders infected machines inoperable. It spreads via stolen credentials and has worm-like capabilities. Shamoon 2.0 introduced ransomware functionality and more advanced evasion techniques. StoneDrill was discovered subsequently using similarities to Shamoon. It has extensive anti-emulation tricks and injects into the browser instead of using drivers. It has backdoor capabilities for remote access in addition to wiping. StoneDrill exhibits code similarities to an APT group called NewsBeef or Newscaster that has previously targeted Middle East oil/energy groups via social engineering. This suggests StoneDrill may be a destructive capability added to this threat actor's arsenal. While Shamoon embeds Arabic, StoneDrill embeds Persian, perhaps suggesting different origins. But definitive attribution is difficult. The simultaneous emergence to target Saudi organizations may indicate aligned interests, if not the same group. In summary, the analysis provides extensive technical details on the inner workings, capabilities, code similarities, and potential attribution theories around the reemergence of these destructive threats in 2016-2017 targeting Saudi Arabia and beyond.
