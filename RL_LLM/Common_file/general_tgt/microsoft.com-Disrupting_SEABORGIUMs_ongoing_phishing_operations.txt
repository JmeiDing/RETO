Microsoft has been tracking and disrupting phishing campaigns by a Russian state-sponsored threat actor group called SEABORGIUM since 2017. Their goals align with Russian intelligence interests. SEABORGIUM conducts persistent phishing against the same targets over years to gain access for intrusions and data theft. They impersonate contacts to build trust before sending malicious links. Primary targets are government, military, NGOs, think tanks, and universities in NATO countries and Ukraine. Attacks often start by compromising personal accounts of experts. Tactics include registering lookalike accounts, establishing rapport before sending URLs in emails or PDF attachments that lead to phishing sites capturing credentials. Microsoft has observed stolen data exfiltration, inbox rule manipulation, and conversations with people of interest using compromised accounts. Espionage appears to be the main motive. Limited involvement with information operations also observed, like leaking stolen docs or emails for narratives. IOCs, detection alerts, hunting queries, and mitigations provided, including stronger MFA, safe links, simulated phishing, and enabling security features in Defender/Office 365. Microsoft has acted to disable accounts and implement detections against SEABORGIUM's infrastructure. Continued tracking and coordination across security firms is ongoing. In summary, the report provides comprehensive insights into SEABORGIUM's tactics, tools, infrastructure, atrribution, and ongoing operations to inform network defenders.
