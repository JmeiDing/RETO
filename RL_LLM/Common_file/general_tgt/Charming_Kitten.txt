The report by ClearSky Cyber Security analyzes the operations and tactics of an Iranian cyberespionage group called Charming Kitten, active since around 2014. Charming Kitten has targeted human rights activists, academic researchers, media outlets and other individuals of interest to the Iranian regime. The report documents their use of fake news agencies, journalists, students and other personas for social engineering. They send spearphishing emails impersonating companies like Google, Facebook and Yahoo to harvest credentials. Watering hole attacks inject malware into websites relevant to targets. Custom malware like DownPaper is distributed via documents and staging servers. Infrastructure analysis uncovered 85+ IP addresses, 240+ domains, and fake accounts on social media platforms tied to Charming Kitten campaigns. Attacks focus on compromising email and social media rather than network intrusion. Recent activity shows they are still active as of late 2017. The report also finds links between Charming Kitten infrastructure/operations and an Iranian hacker group called Rocket Kitten. And connections are made between Charming Kitten activity and Behzad Mesri, an Iranian national indicted by the FBI for hacking HBO. In summary, the report provides an extensive profile of the Iranian Charming Kitten cyberespionage group - their tactics, infrastructure, malware, victim targeting and social engineering - based on incidents and attacks analyzed from 2016-2017.
