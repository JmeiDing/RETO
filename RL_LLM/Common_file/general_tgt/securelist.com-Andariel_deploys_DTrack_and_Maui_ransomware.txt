The report from Kaspersky provides an analysis of a recent ransomware campaign attributed to the North Korean APT group Andariel, which is also known as Silent Chollima and Stonefly. Andariel has been active since at least 2013 and has previously targeted organizations globally. In this campaign, Andariel deployed the DTrack malware, which gathers system information, followed by the Maui ransomware onto systems approximately 10 hours later. The earliest known Maui ransomware sample dates back to April 15, 2021 where it targeted a housing company in Japan, despite previous reports claiming May 2021 as the first appearance. Additional DTrack samples were found on systems in India, Vietnam, and Russia from late 2020 to early 2021, indicating a broader campaign. The group appears to gain initial access by exploiting vulnerable public-facing web services like WebLogic. Powershell scripts and tools like Bitsadmin are used to download additional malware. The new information-gathering module sends stolen information to a remote server over HTTP, and this variant copies stolen files to the remote host on the same network. Andariel seems opportunistic, targeting organizations globally regardless of industry if they have financial means to pay ransoms. While recent Maui ransomware targets in the US were healthcare related, the full scope is wider. Kaspersky assesses with low to medium confidence that the tactics, techniques, and procedures match those previously associated with Andariel, thereby attributing the Maui ransomware to this group.
