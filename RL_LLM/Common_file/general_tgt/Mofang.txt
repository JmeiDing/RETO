The PDF describes the activities of a politically-motivated Chinese state-sponsored hacking group called Mofang that has been active since at least 2012. Mofang conducts cyber espionage campaigns aimed at stealing sensitive information from a range of targets including government, military, critical infrastructure, and companies in sectors like automotive and weapons technology. Mofang relies on social engineering and custom malware tools named ShimRat and ShimRatReporter rather than exploits to gain initial access. Their attacks involve carefully staged reconnaissance, setting up infrastructure mimicking the target network, and then a main compromise phase. One of Mofang's main focus areas has been Myanmar government and companies involved in development projects and Chinese investments there. They are thought to select targets based on involvement with investments or technology that could threaten Chinese interests. Other known targets include India's defence sector, Germany automotive companies, Singapore, South Korea, and more. Mofang's tools gather system info and can steal files, keylogs, screenshots, etc. Their malware uses tricks like antivirus hijacking to appear legitimate. While Mofang is still active, the report provides Yara rules, IOCs, and other technical details on their malware to detect and defend against them. The report concludes Mofang is a sophisticated, targeted threat actor likely affiliated with the Chinese state that bears monitoring and defence against, especially for organizations involved in sectors of interest to China.
