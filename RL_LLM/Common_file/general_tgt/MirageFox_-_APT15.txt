The PDF discusses activity by a Chinese state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) group called APT15, also known as Mirage or Vixen Panda. It provides background on APT15 and describes new malware samples uploaded in June 2018 that appear to be new versions of APT15's Remote Access Trojan (RAT) called Mirage. The new RAT has been named MirageFox and contains code reused from previous APT15 tools like Mirage and Reaver. The malware is not widely detected on VirusTotal. MirageFox uses DLL hijacking techniques seen in APT15's previous campaigns. The decrypted C&C configuration in MirageFox shows it is likely tailored to a network APT15 has already infiltrated, with an internal IP address for command and control. MirageFox has typical RAT functionality found in APT15 malware. There is high confidence MirageFox can be attributed to APT15 based on code reuse and similarities to previous tools. APT15 is known to customize malware to targeted environments after initial network compromise. The report provides IOCs for the MirageFox samples and related malware. In summary, the PDF analyzes new malware activity by the APT15 Chinese threat group, which appears to reuse code from their previous tools to create updated versions for ongoing cyber espionage campaigns.
