The document describes a spear phishing campaign conducted in August 2015 by a China-based cyber threat group targeting Hong Kong media organizations. The main points are: - The threat group, tracked by FireEye as "admin@338", used recent political events in Hong Kong as lures in spear phishing emails containing malware. - The emails had attachments exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability to deliver a malware payload called LOWBALL. This malware uses the Dropbox API for command and control. - The LOWBALL abuses Dropbox for command and control (CnC), LOWBALL is used to collect system information and download additional malware like BUBBLEWRAP. This allows the threat actors to gather intelligence and pivot to additional infections. - The threat group is believed to be targeting Hong Kong media groups to monitor networks and gain advance warning of protests or other activities. - FireEye collaborated with Dropbox to uncover potentially a second operation by the group using similar tactics, infecting up to 50 targets. - The use of legitimate services like cloud storage for command and control allows the group to hide its activity and evade detection. - The campaign reflects a focus by China-based groups on targeting Hong Kong media and pro-democracy organizations, likely to monitor their networks and dissent. This attack is part of a trend where threat groups hide malicious activity by communicating with legitimate web services such as social networking and cloud storage sites to foil detection efforts. In summary, the document provides an in-depth look at the tactics, techniques and malware used by a sophisticated China-based threat group in a spear phishing campaign against Hong Kong media outlets in 2015. It illustrates the group's abuse of cloud services for stealthy command and control.
