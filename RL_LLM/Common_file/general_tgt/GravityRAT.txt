The document analyzes a remote access trojan (RAT) called GravityRAT that has been targeting entities in India for over 2 years. GravityRAT is spread via malicious Office documents containing macros that download the RAT payload. Four versions were identified (G1-G4) showing ongoing development. Capabilities include system info collection, file exfiltration, command execution, and anti-VM checks. New features were added in each version. Attribution evidence like PDB paths and submissions from Pakistan point to an actor nicknamed "The Invincible". Links to CERT-India suggest targeting of Indian organizations. Network infrastructure analysis revealed heavy traffic from India to the C2 domains. Testing on VirusTotal showed efforts to evade detection. GravityRAT continues to be active and dangerous despite lacking sophistication. Indicators of compromise and detection methods are provided to defend against this threat. The document charts the evolution of this lesser known RAT and its threat to India over time. While basic, GravityRAT exemplifies targeted malware that can stay undetected with continuous improvements.
