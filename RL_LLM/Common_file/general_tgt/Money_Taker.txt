The PDF describes the activities of a financially-motivated hacking group called MoneyTaker that has conducted attacks on organizations in the US, UK, and Russia since 2016. MoneyTaker uses custom malware and pen testing tools to compromise bank networks and steal money through systems like interbank transfers or payment card processing. MoneyTaker's attacks involve carefully staged reconnaissance, mimicking the target's infrastructure, and then stealing credentials to access financial systems. They have developed custom tools like "MoneyTaker" for interbank transfer systems and "ScanPOS" for payment card networks. The group prioritizes stealth, often removing their traces after the theft is complete. Notable campaigns have targeted a Russian interbank transfer system, where they modified transaction records to hide their fraud, as well as banks in the US by manipulating card withdrawal limits. The group has stolen sensitive bank documentation on various money transfer systems, suggesting plans for future heists. The report recommends banks isolate payment systems and enforce strict access control to defend against MoneyTaker. Indicators of compromise like file hashes, domains, and IP addresses used in MoneyTaker's infrastructure are provided to help detect their activities. While the group appears to operate out of Russia, their campaigns show they are an indiscriminate financial threat to organizations globally.
