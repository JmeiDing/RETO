The document describes two recent attacks where the Entropy ransomware was delivered after initial infections by Cobalt Strike beacons and Dridex malware bots. In the first attack on a media organization, attackers exploited ProxyShell on an Exchange server and spread Cobalt Strike over 4 months before launching Entropy in December. Dridex payloads were found on some infected machines. In the second attack on a government organization, a malicious email attachment infected a user with Dridex botnet malware. Dridex installed other malware like ScreenConnect and was used to move laterally and exfiltrate data quickly before launching Entropy. Sophos had not seen Entropy prior to these attacks. Analysis revealed subroutines and behaviors in Entropy similar to Dridex, like string decryption logic and API resolving code. The Entropy packer was even detected by a Dridex-specific signature. The attackers used free tools like Sysinternals and WinRAR plus the ScreenConnect remote access tool. They tried but failed to run Cobalt Strike on protected endpoints, indicating the role of security protections. Hardcoded strings in Entropy referenced one target's name and the book "Looking for Alaska". The ransom note warned victims not to contact law enforcement or negotiators. Detection of Dridex and Cobalt Strike preceded the ransomware. Properly patched and secured systems could have prevented the initial footholds. Multifactor authentication would have further hindered unauthorized access.
