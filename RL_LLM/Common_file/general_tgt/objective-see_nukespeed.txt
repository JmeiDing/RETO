The blog post analyzes a recent macOS malware sample called NukeSped distributed by the North Korean Lazarus Group. It is delivered in two stages - first via a trojanized cryptocurrency app, then by downloading the backdoor NukeSped. The initial app Esilet uses an Electron framework and JavaScript to check for updates which downloads the next stage malware. NukeSped persists as a launch agent and uses libcurl networking APIs to communicate with command and control servers. Analysis of NukeSped shows it is a full-featured backdoor capable of surveying the system, executing arbitrary commands, reading/writing files, and more based on commands from the C2 server. The author demonstrates how existing macOS security tools like KnockKnock, BlockBlock, and LuLu detect the malware's behaviors like persistence and network connections even without prior knowledge of this new threat. The tools provide effective heuristic detection and can block the malware.
