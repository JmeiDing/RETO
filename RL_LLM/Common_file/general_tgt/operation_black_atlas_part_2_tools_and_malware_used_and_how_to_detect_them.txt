This paper provides additional details on the tactics, tools, and malware used in Operation Black Atlas, a global campaign targeting point-of-sale (PoS) systems. The attackers first use penetration testing tools like brute force password crackers to gain initial access to networks. Once inside, they move laterally and introduce PoS malware using the Windows BITS service to bypass defenses. Variants of PoS threats seen in Black Atlas include NewPOSThings, Neutrino, Kasidet, BlackPOS, CenterPOS, Project Hook, and PwnPOS. The attackers have modified the Gorynych botnet to specifically search for and exfiltrate data stolen by BlackPOS. Gorynych reports to command servers via encrypted HTTP posts. It can download plugins for taking screenshots, stealing passwords, keylogging, and more. The ties between Gorynych and BlackPOS prove the attackers are intently going after payment card data. Recommendations for defending networks include segmentation, monitoring, log mining, default credential changes, firewalls, endpoint controls, and prioritizing based on individual threat landscapes. Specific indicators of compromise are provided for detecting the tools and malware used by Black Atlas. The paper reveals the sophisticated tactics and tools being leveraged to steal payment card data from PoS systems globally, posing a major risk to retailers this holiday season.
