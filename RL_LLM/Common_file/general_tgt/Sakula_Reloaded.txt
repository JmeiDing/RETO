The report analyzes the malware variant Sakula, which has been linked to several major targeted intrusion campaigns over the past few years. Sakula is a remote access toolkit that has been publicly examined multiple times. The report focuses on three main Sakula campaigns: - The "French Aerospace" campaign in 2014 that leveraged a zero-day exploit and targeted French aerospace websites. The payload was Sakula communicating with a command-and-control domain. - The "Ironman" campaign in 2014 that used spoofed domains and signed Sakula droppers masquerading as software installers to target various organizations. This campaign overlaps in tactics with the next one. - The "INOCNATION" campaign in 2015 that used a new Sakula variant in highly tailored phishing emails containing malware installers. The new variant communicates over HTTPS. The report notes similarities in code and tactics between the campaigns, but assesses there is no definitive connection between them. The analyst concludes Sakula is a limited-release tool used by multiple adversaries, often along with the PlugX malware. Overall, the report illustrates the complexity around attributing malware like Sakula to specific threat actors, the importance of in-depth technical analysis to understand relationships between campaigns, and the ongoing evolution of sophisticated targeted intrusion tools and tactics.
