The cybercrime group FIN7 has continued its hacking activities despite arrests of some members in 2018. FIN7 conducts sophisticated spearphishing campaigns targeting hundreds of companies to steal financial data and assets. They use fake companies to recruit developers and interpreters to assist in their criminal activities. Recent FIN7 campaigns in 2018-2019 show they are using new malicious document builders and tactics to evade detection, but still rely on their Griffon malware implant delivered via macros. The Griffon implant has modular components for reconnaissance, screenshotting, downloading meterpreter, and achieving persistence. By tracking the command and control servers, researchers found connections between FIN7 and a fake Russian cybersecurity company used for recruiting. Links were also found between FIN7 and other threat groups CobaltGoblin, AveMaria, and CopyPaste, showing possible associations or mimicking of FIN7's tactics. FIN7, CobaltGoblin, AveMaria, and CopyPaste rely on spearphishing campaigns and exploiting unpatched corporate systems. The continued success of FIN7 despite arrests shows the resilience of cybercriminal groups. Companies should be aware of the ongoing threat posed by FIN7 and implement strong security practices to detect and prevent their attacks.
