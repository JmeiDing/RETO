The security researchers at Kaspersky Lab have continued monitoring the activities of an alleged North Korea-linked threat actor group called ScarCruft. ScarCruft typically targets organizations and companies with connections to the Korean peninsula. Kaspersky recently discovered new telemetry showing that ScarCruft is still active and evolving its attack tools. The group uses a multi-stage binary infection procedure to effectively update modules and evade detection. The initial dropper bypass Windows UAC to execute the next payload with higher privileges. The payload connects to a C2 server to fetch more modules. One module uses steganography to hide communications. The final payload is a backdoor called ROKRAT that can steal information, download additional payloads, execute commands, and more. ScarCruft has also developed a Bluetooth device harvester to steal Bluetooth device info from infected machines. The recent victims include investment and trading companies in Vietnam and Russia that may have North Korea links. A diplomatic agency in Hong Kong was also hit. ScarCruft appears focused on gathering intelligence for political and diplomatic purposes related to North Korea. There is some overlap between ScarCruft and the DarkHotel APT group in targeting certain victims. Both groups target Korean-speaking victims but have different TTPs. Kaspersky concludes that ScarCruft remains a highly skilled and active threat actor that continues to evolve its tools. The group seems likely to keep targeting North Korean affairs.
