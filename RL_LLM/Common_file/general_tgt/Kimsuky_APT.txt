The document analyzes recent activity by the North Korean APT group Kimsuky. The group was first identified in 2013 and targets South Korea. The analysis begins with a tweet from February 2020 that prompted further investigation into new Kimsuky malware. The malware uses a simple infection chain starting with a screensaver file that writes a DLL to the temp folder. The DLL gains persistence and injects into explorer.exe to avoid detection. It contacts a command and control server every 15 minutes to send back system information. The malware uses encryption to decode strings before executing malicious actions. It contacts the C2 at suzuki.datastore.pe.hu using different URLs and user agents. The analysis compares this new malware to previous Kimsuky campaigns, finding strong similarities in tactics, techniques, and procedures. This suggests the malware can be attributed to Kimsuky with high confidence, despite some minor differences. Indicators of compromise are provided, including hashes of the malware components and the C2 domain. Yara rules are included to detect the malware. In summary, this analysis provides an in-depth look at a new malware campaign conducted by the North Korean Kimsuky group against South Korean targets. It highlights their evolving tactics while confirming attribution through TTP similarities with previous activity.
