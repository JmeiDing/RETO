The report analyzes a spear phishing campaign targeting Indian embassies and the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in September-October 2016. - Emails spoofed the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs and used themes related to the Uri terror attack and Kashmir protests. - Emails contained Word docs that dropped a remote access trojan called njRAT when macros were enabled. - Maldocs downloaded obfuscated PowerShell scripts from Pastebin to retrieve njRAT executables. - njRAT allows attackers to spy on victims by logging keystrokes, accessing webcams, recording audio, etc. - Infrastructure analysis revealed the campaign likely tied to a Pakistan state-sponsored group aiming to monitor India's response to the geo-political events. - Tactics showed sophistication via macro obfuscation, user interaction triggers, dynamic DNS C2, and customized malware to evade detection. - Targeting of Indian government entities and timing of emails indicate attackers' interest in intelligence gathering related to the events in Kashmir and Uri. - Comprehensive technical analysis provides indicators of compromise and other threat intelligence to detect this campaign. The report provides an in-depth look at the technical details and context behind the threat actors, tactics, and infrastructure used in this targeted attack.
