The document is a report from Kaspersky Lab detailing a Middle Eastern cyberespionage group they call Desert Falcons. The group has been operating since at least 2011 targeting victims mainly in Egypt, Palestine, Israel, and Jordan. Desert Falcons uses socially engineered emails with political or news themes as lures to deliver their homemade remote access trojan malware. They have developed custom Windows and Android malware under continuous evolution. Their Windows malware includes the Falcons Trojan, DHS Spyware, and DHS2015/iRat. These provide backdoor access to steal files, log keystrokes, take screenshots, record audio, etc. Desert Falcons sets up command and control servers to manage infected machines. They carefully categorize victims and appoint operators to monitor them. Over 1 million files have been exfiltrated. Attack timelines and evidence like language settings indicate the threat actors are native Arabic speakers from the Middle East region. Identities of some were found on publicly accessible servers. The group comprises around 30 people across 3 teams. Kaspersky detects and blocks the malware families used by Desert Falcons. The report demonstrates how targeted attacks are increasing in the Middle East using customized malware for cyberespionage, requiring defenses tailored to the region. In summary, Desert Falcons is a professionally operated cyberespionage group active since 2011 hacking Middle Eastern targets with its own evolving Windows and Android malware managed via command and control servers.
