The whitepaper provides an analysis of the CrashOverride malware framework used in the December 2016 cyberattack that caused a blackout in Ukraine. CrashOverride is modular malware tailored for attacking electric grid operations. Its components include an initial backdoor, a launcher, payloads, and a wiper module. The backdoor provides access to infected hosts. The launcher loads ICS-specific payload modules that manipulate grid operations. The wiper disrupts systems after payloads execute. The payload modules implement grid communications protocols like IEC 104, IEC 61850, and OPC DA to interact with grid devices. This allows CrashOverride to monitor, send unauthorized commands, and spoof normal operations. It can open breakers to de-energize substations and manipulate protective relays. CrashOverride evolves previous ICS malware tradecraft by codifying knowledge of grid operations into reusable modules. It can be adapted to target facilities in Europe and some parts of the Middle East and Asia. Expanding protocol support would allow broader targeting. While CrashOverride cannot cause widespread grid failure, coordinated attacks could result in regional outages over multiple days. However, grid defenses like human monitoring and redundancy provide resilience against such attacks. Recommended mitigations include monitoring for protocol anomalies, robust backups, and incident response planning. In summary, the whitepaper provides a technical analysis of the CrashOverride malware's modular framework, grid-specific payloads, and potential to cause disruptive attacks against electric utilities.
