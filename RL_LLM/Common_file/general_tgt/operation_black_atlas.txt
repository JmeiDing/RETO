The paper describes a malware campaign called Operation Black Atlas that is targeting point-of-sale (PoS) systems and stealing payment card data from small and medium businesses globally. The operators have been active since September 2015 and have breached targets in healthcare, retail, and other industries in countries around the world. They use a variety of penetration testing tools to infiltrate networks and then deploy PoS malware, primarily variants of BlackPOS (also called Kaptoxa) which was used in the Target breach. Once inside the network, they move laterally, familiarize themselves with the environment, and introduce the PoS malware. In some cases, they have used a modular botnet called Gorynych to download and install BlackPOS which scrapes credit card data from memory. The botnet then exfiltrates the stolen card numbers back to the attackers. In addition to payment card data, the attackers have also stolen credentials, email accounts, CCTV video feeds, and other sensitive information. The campaign demonstrates how attackers are leveraging PoS malware to target brick-and-mortar retailers and other businesses globally during the holiday shopping season. The paper provides an overview of the attackers' tactics, the malware used, the global scope of targets, and the risks this poses to retailers and other businesses relying on PoS systems this holiday season.
