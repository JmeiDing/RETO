 The document analyzes an incident where advanced persistent threat (APT) actors compromised the network of a Defense Industrial Base organization from November 2021 to January 2022. The actors gained initial access to the Microsoft Exchange server in January 2021 using unknown means. Over months, they used tools like Impacket for lateral movement and the custom exfiltration malware CovalentStealer to steal sensitive data. Technical details are provided on the APT tactics, techniques, and procedures, mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This includes use of compromised credentials, Windows commands, Impacket for access and execution, proxy services, and data staging. Specific indicators of compromise and YARA rules are listed for detection. Mitigation recommendations focus on multifactor authentication, network segmentation, patching, monitoring anomalous behaviors, restricting tools, and implementing access controls. The report aims to help critical infrastructure organizations manage cyber threats by applying the provided threat intelligence on recent APT tradecraft targeting the Defense Industrial Base sector.
