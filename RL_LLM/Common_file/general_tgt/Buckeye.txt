The document describes the activities of a cyberespionage group called Buckeye (also known as APT3, Gothic Panda, UPS Team, and TG-0110). Buckeye has been operating since at least 2009, traditionally targeting organizations in the US using spear-phishing emails containing malware. However, since June 2015, Buckeye has shifted focus to compromising political entities in Hong Kong, sending malicious emails through August 2016. Analysis by Symantec reveals Buckeye infecting 82 organizations globally since 2015, but only remaining active on 17 it deemed valuable targets - 13 in Hong Kong, 3 in the US, 1 in the UK. The group uses the Backdoor.Pirpi remote access trojan and other custom hacking tools to spread in networks and steal data, and has used zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash. The group has also used keyloggers and other tools to gather network information and steal passwords. Symantec provides details on Buckeye's malware, tactics, targets, and recommendations for protection against this cyberespionage group. The document concludes with indicators of compromise including domain names, IP addresses, and SHA256 hashes associated with Buckeye.
