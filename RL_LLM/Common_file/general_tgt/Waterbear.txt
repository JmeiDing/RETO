The report analyzes a new version of the Waterbear malware campaign associated with the BlackTech cyberespionage group. Waterbear is modular malware that has been active for years, mainly targeting technology companies and government agencies in East Asia. This new version employs API hooking techniques to evade detection by a specific APAC-based security product. It hooks the ZwOpenProcess and GetExtendedTcpTable APIs to hide its presence. The malware has a complex infection chain, using a malicious DLL loader and encrypted payloads. The first payload injects the API hooking code into the security product. The second payload is a typical Waterbear backdoor. Technical details are provided on Waterbear's anti-memory scanning methods, string encryption, configuration, and command and control communication. Indicators of compromise are included such as file hashes, YARA rules, and MITRE ATT&CK techniques matched to Waterbear's capabilities. The report suggests the attackers have extensive knowledge of the targeted security product and the victim's environment. While currently focused on a single product, the generic API hooking approach could be adapted to evade other solutions in the future. The research aims to uncover this new evasion tactic and improve defenses against Waterbear campaigns.
