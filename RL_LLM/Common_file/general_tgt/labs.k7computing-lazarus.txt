The document analyzes a malware campaign by the Lazarus APT group, dubbed Operation In(ter)ception, targeting macOS users. The malware uses a signed binary disguised as a Coinbase job vacancy PDF to bypass security and infect systems. When executed, it drops files including a PDF, bundle app, downloader agent, and empty file in the Fonts folder. The PDF opens as a decoy while the malware executes in the background, wiping terminal history. It extracts binaries from the dropped files and creates a launch agent to persist on the system. The second stage app executes the third stage downloader which gathers system info and communicates with a command and control server to download additional payloads. The C2 server was inactive during analysis so the final payload is unknown. The malware uses signed binaries, pops up decoy documents, and executes covertly in the background to evade detection. The targeting of macOS users by Lazarus highlights that all systems are being targeted by advanced persistent threat actors. The report recommends using reputable antivirus and updating regularly to stay protected.
