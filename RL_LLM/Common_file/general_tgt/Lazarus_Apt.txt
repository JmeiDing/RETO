The document analyzes a recent phishing campaign attributed to the Lazarus advanced persistent threat (APT) group targeting South Korea. The attack starts with a weaponized document containing macros that extract and decompress a malicious HTA file embedded in a PNG image. The HTA file drops malware that decrypts and loads a RAT payload. The document lures users to enable macros and see a message before executing. The VBA macros save the document as HTML to access embedded images, convert a PNG to BMP to decompress the HTA file, and execute it with mshta.exe. The HTA drops malware that decrypts a RAT payload in memory. The RAT initialization creates a mutex, resolves APIs, and contacts C2 servers. It can receive encrypted commands to execute processes or scripts and exfiltrate data. This matches prior Lazarus TTPs. Attribution is based on custom encryption algorithm overlap, obfuscation methods, code similarities to Lazarus tools, targeting South Korea, and other factors. The attack shows the group's continued development of custom tooling and techniques like embedding objects in images to bypass detection. The targeting of South Korea and ongoing innovation highlight the persistent threat posed by this sophisticated actor.
