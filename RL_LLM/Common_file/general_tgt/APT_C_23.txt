This PDF document, APT_C_23.pdf, is about an Android spyware named Android/SpyC23.A, which was discovered by ESET in 2020. The malware is part of a group called APT-C-23 and has evolved to include new capabilities such as screen recording, taking screenshots, and reading text from selected messaging and social media apps. It also has the ability to record incoming and outgoing calls in WhatsApp and make calls while creating a black screen overlay activity. The malware uses a fake app store called "DigitalApps" to distribute itself, which requires users to enter a six-digit coupon code to download the malware. The app store contains both malicious and clean items, with the non-malicious ones redirecting users to another unofficial Android app store that serves legitimate apps. Android/SpyC23.A can perform various actions on the target device, including taking pictures, recording audio, restarting Wi-Fi, exfiltrating call logs, SMS messages, contacts, files, uninstalling apps, stealing APK installers of installed apps, hiding its icon, getting credit balance on the SIM of the device (by making calls to different cellular operators), and dismissing notifications from built-in security apps on some Android devices. The malware's C&C (command and control) communication has also been updated to be well hidden using various techniques and can be remotely changed by the attacker. The encrypted string returned by the native library is used as part of the password to encrypt files extracted from the affected device and the decrypted string suggests a Facebook profile page for the C&C. To prevent falling victim to this type of malware, it is recommended to only install apps from the official Google Play Store and to use a trustworthy and up-to-date mobile security solution if privacy concerns or access issues prevent following this advice.
