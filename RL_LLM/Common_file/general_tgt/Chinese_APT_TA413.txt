The PDF describes cyber espionage campaigns by the Chinese APT group TA413 targeting Tibetan dissidents and European economic entities using a new malware called Sepulcher. In March 2020, TA413 sent emails impersonating WHO COVID-19 guidance to European targets delivering Sepulcher malware. The emails originated from an account used since 2012 to target Tibetans with LuckyCat malware. In July 2020, TA413 resumed targeting Tibetans, using an email account linked to historic ExileRAT campaigns. The emails contained Tibet-themed lures and delivered Sepulcher. Sepulcher is a basic remote access trojan that can gather system intelligence, spawn shells, and read/write files. It uses single byte XOR encrypted C2 communications. The C2 communication of the Sepulcher malware uses a domain called Dalailamatrustindia.ddns[.]net and an attachment titled "file.dll". TA413's temporary shift from targeting Tibet to collecting economic intelligence on COVID-19 impacted Europe shows threat actor dynamics amid a global crisis. However, the group quickly resumed conventional targeting of Tibetans. The reuse of known accounts and payloads shows mistakes in OPSEC, but delivering new malware like Sepulcher allows TA413 to avoid detections focused on ExileRAT. Defenders should block known malicious accounts, scrutinize COVID-19 lures, monitor system activities for IOCs, and share threat intelligence to identify evolving attacks.
