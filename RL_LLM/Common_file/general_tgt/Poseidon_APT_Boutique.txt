The PDF describes a sophisticated cyberespionage group called Poseidon that has been active since at least 2005. Poseidon is unique for custom-tailoring malware and tools for each target, taking an artistic, boutique approach to their operations. Poseidon uses spear-phishing emails with weaponized Office docs to gain initial access. They then use expert Windows admin skills for stealthy lateral movement within networks to find valuable data and access things like domain controllers. A tool called IGT orchestrates their data collection, exfiltration, and cleanup of traces. Poseidon has a distinct extortion model where they blackmail targets to hire them as security consultants, while still maintaining network access. The group heavily focuses on Windows systems and Portuguese/English environments. Known sectors targeted include energy, manufacturing, media, and PR firms. Victims are concentrated in Brazil, the US, France, and other countries. Though Poseidon's malware evolves, it often uses unique technical tricks like hijacking satellite communications. The PDF outlines recommendations for updated endpoint security, encryption, email scanning, and other measures to detect threats like Poseidon.
