The document provides an in-depth technical analysis of Stuxnet 0.5, the earliest known version of the infamous Stuxnet malware. Stuxnet 0.5 dates back to November 2005 and was first detected in the wild in November 2007. It spreads only through infected Siemens Step 7 project files and has limited command and control capabilities compared to later versions. Stuxnet 0.5 is designed to target Siemens 417 PLCs used in uranium enrichment facilities by fingerprinting the industrial control system. It parses human-designated symbol labels to map device addresses and builds a special data block DB8061 used in the attack code. The attack involves replaying normal sensor signals while modifying output signals to close valves controlling uranium hexafluoride gas centrifuges. This excessive gas pressure can potentially damage centrifuges and enrichment systems. Later Stuxnet versions switched strategies to target centrifuge speeds directly rather than valves. Stuxnet 0.5 reveals the evolution of the malware from its early PLC valve attack strategy to the more advanced centrifuge speed attacks in 2009-2010. The modular, professionally developed code suggests the malware was created by a sophisticated team with insider knowledge of industrial control systems and funding/resources for a long-term operation. Stuxnet 0.5 provides valuable insight into the origins, early strategies, and development process of the groundbreaking cyberweapon.
