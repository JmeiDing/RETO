The document discusses a zero-day vulnerability in Google Chrome (CVE-2022-2294) that was recently exploited in the wild to target journalists and news agencies in the Middle East, primarily in Lebanon. The attacks are attributed to Candiru, an Israeli spyware vendor, based on the malware and tactics used. Candiru exploited a vulnerability in WebRTC to achieve remote code execution in Chrome. This was chained with a separate sandbox escape exploit. Avast reported the vulnerability to Google, who patched it on July 4, 2022. The attacks started with compromising a website used by employees of a news agency in Lebanon. Persistent XSS was used to inject malicious JavaScript that profiled victims and routed targeted ones to the exploit server. The exploit server collected extensive browser data to verify targets before delivering exploits over an encrypted channel. At the end of the exploit chain, the DevilsTongue spyware payload attempted to escalate to the kernel using a zero-day vulnerability in a signed driver. The vulnerable driver has two flawed IOCTL handlers that allow reading and writing physical memory. The attacks were highly targeted, with the goal likely being to spy on journalists and news stories. The vulnerabilities posed a wider threat too, affecting other Chromium-based browsers and Apple's Safari until patches were released. To protect themselves, Chrome users simply need to update to the latest version. Avast Secure Browser was also patched. The report aims to raise awareness of the active exploitation of these now-patched zero-days.
