The PDF describes the cyberespionage activities of an advanced persistent threat (APT) group called Earth Centaur or Tropic Trooper. The group has been active since 2011 targeting transportation companies and government agencies related to transportation. The initial intrusion involves exploiting vulnerabilities like ProxyLogon in Exchange Server to gain access. Web shells are used to install loaders like Nerapack, which retrieves next-stage payloads like the Quasar RAT. Multiple customized backdoors are deployed on compromised systems, communicating over common protocols like ICMP or HTTPS to blend in with normal traffic. Backdoors like ChiserClient, HTShell, Lilith RAT, and SmileSvr support functions like command execution, file operations, and exfiltration. The group uses open-source malware frameworks like Mongoose and WolfSSL to efficiently build new backdoor variants. Evasion techniques include timestomping, encrypted configurations, process injection, and self-deletion. After intruding, the group conducts discovery of Active Directory and internal systems. Tools like SharpHound, FRPC, Chisel, and Rclone are used for lateral movement, tunneling, and exfiltration. Credentials are dumped using built-in Windows utilities. Attribution to Earth Centaur is based on shared code, configurations, and mutex styles with previous campaigns. The group seems to originate from a Chinese-speaking region. Recommendations include reviewing security controls, using multilayered protections, and leveraging threat intelligence to gain insights into malware behaviors and quickly detect intrusions.
