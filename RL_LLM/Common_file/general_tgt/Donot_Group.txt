Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF: The document describes a targeted attack by the APT group Donot against a Pakistani businessman working in China. The attacks started in May 2018 via phishing emails containing malicious Office documents. The initial Excel document contains macros that drop a downloader called office_update.exe. This fetches additional scripts and executables including a plugin downloader called wlidsvcc.exe. The plugins perform keylogging, file listing, system info collection, and data exfiltration. Donot sets up persistence mechanisms like registry modifications and startup folder shortcuts. The malware communicates with command and control servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data. Analysis of the macro code, plugins, infrastructure, and victimology confirms Donot (also called APT-C-35) conducted the attack. Donot has been active since at least 2016 targeting Pakistan and other South Asian countries, as well as some Middle Eastern victims. The attacks demonstrate Donot's continued interest in compromising Pakistani targets, now including personnel working abroad in China. The use of decoy documents and evolving malware variants shows the group's efforts to evade detection. The report recommends mitigation measures like security awareness training, asset management, and threat intelligence to help defend against such targeted attacks. Implementation of threat detection products and threat intel integration can also greatly reduce the risk of similar espionage campaigns.
