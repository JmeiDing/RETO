The document details a phishing campaign by a China-based threat actor group called APT3 that exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player. In June 2015, APT3 sent phishing emails with links to compromised servers hosting malicious Flash files that exploited the CVE-2015-3113 vulnerability. Once exploited, the malware installed a custom backdoor on target systems called SHOTPUT. The phishing emails had generic content to lure targets to click on links to the exploit servers. The links led to sites that profiled the visiting host before serving the Flash exploit if the victim was deemed a high-value target. The exploit utilized common techniques like heap spraying, vector corruption, and return-oriented programming (ROP) to bypass mitigations like ASLR and DEP. It stored the payload encrypted in the Flash file and decrypted it in memory after exploitation. The ROP chain called VirtualAlloc to mark the shellcode as executable. Overall, the attack showed APT3's sophistication and rapid lateral movement capabilities. The group quickly harvested credentials, moved through networks, and installed custom malware. They utilized zero-days, frequently-updated backdoors, and disposable infrastructure, making them difficult to track across campaigns. The report acts as a case study of an advanced threat actor exploiting a zero-day vulnerability through targeted phishing emails.
