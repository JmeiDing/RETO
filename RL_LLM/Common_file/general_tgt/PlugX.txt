The PDF describes the PlugX remote access trojan (RAT) malware and a new downloader called ZeroT used by a suspected Chinese cyberespionage group to target military and aerospace organizations in Russia and Belarus. The group sends spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access. The attachments can be CHM help files or Word docs exploiting CVE-2012-0158. When opened, they drop the first stage ZeroT malware. ZeroT uses various techniques like UAC bypass and sideloading to evade detection and install the next stage PlugX RAT. It communicates with command servers using encrypted HTTP to receive configurations and download additional payloads. In recent campaigns, ZeroT has started using steganography to hide PlugX inside BMP image files, which are very subtle in appearance. An embedded custom LSB algorithm is used to extract the payload from the image. PlugX allows the threat actor to carry out traditional RAT activities like command execution, screen captures, file exfiltration, etc. It uses encrypted HTTP or peer-to-peer communication to talk to command servers. Infrastructure links indicate ZeroT and PlugX are operated by the same group as the NetTraveler malware, which has previously targeted Russia and Eastern Europe. The malware continues to evolve with new delivery techniques and anti-analysis features.
