The document discusses the use of satellite internet links by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups as a way to mask their command and control infrastructure from takedowns. It focuses on the Turla APT group (also known as Snake or Uroburos), an elite Russian-linked cyberespionage group active since 2007. Turla is highlighted for their sophisticated use of satellite internet links to anonymize their C2 servers, making it difficult to identify the operators or physically seize the hardware. Turla abuses unencrypted downstream satellite internet links by hijacking the traffic through a method that only requires a satellite dish, DVB-S tuner, and PC running Linux. By listening for packets sent to IPs routed through hacked satellite links, Turla can spoof responses back to senders while the legitimate user ignores them. This allows Turla to hide C2 servers in satellite IP ranges across the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. The links are kept up for months and cycled regularly. The document provides technical details on how Turla implements these attacks, which require minimal investment compared to purchasing full satellite links. It's noted that only a few advanced APTs have been observed using this technique so far, but there are concerns it could become more widespread. IOCs and recommendations for defense are provided.
