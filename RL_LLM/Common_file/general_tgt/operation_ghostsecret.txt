The PDF discusses an ongoing global cyberespionage campaign called Operation GhostSecret conducted by the North Korean state-sponsored group Hidden Cobra. The campaign has been active since at least 2016, targeting critical infrastructure, finance, healthcare, entertainment, and other industries in 17 countries. The hackers use multiple custom malware implants, including new undiscovered ones like Bankshot and Proxysvc. The implants are capable of reconnaissance, spreading laterally, installing further payloads, and exfiltrating data to command servers. Shared code and infrastructure links GhostSecret to previous Hidden Cobra campaigns like the Sony Pictures hack. The initial vector is unknown but tactics include watering hole attacks and comprising routers. The Proxysvc implant runs stealthily since 2017 to create backdoors, while Bankshot gathers system info. Newer variants observed in 2018 can gather data, run commands, and wipe systems. The control servers use SSL and are hosted on compromised university servers. McAfee assesses with high confidence the campaign originates from Hidden Cobra due to code similarities with previous operations. The hackers continuously evolve implants to gather sensitive data from compromised networks globally. Defenders are advised to apply latest security updates and monitor networks for indicators of compromise provided.
