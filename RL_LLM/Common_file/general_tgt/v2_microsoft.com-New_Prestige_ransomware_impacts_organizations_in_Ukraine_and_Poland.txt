The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has identified a new ransomware campaign called "Prestige" targeting organizations in the transportation and logistics industries in Ukraine and Poland. The ransomware was deployed on October 11 against multiple victims within an hour. MSTIC now attributes these attacks to the Russia-based threat actor IRIDIUM, which overlaps with Sandworm. This attribution is based on forensic artifacts linking IRIDIUM to interactive compromise of Prestige victims as early as March 2022. The Prestige attacks display some differences from other recent destructive attacks in Ukraine like FoxBlade/HermeticWiper and AprilAxe/CaddyWiper. However, it shares victimology with Russian state-aligned activity. Prior to deploying ransomware, IRIDIUM used remote execution tools like RemoteExec and Impacket for privilege escalation and credential theft. To deploy ransomware, IRIDIUM copied payloads to admin shares or domain controllers and executed via scheduled tasks, WMI, or group policy. Analysis of the Prestige ransomware shows it encrypts files with certain extensions and appends .enc, using Crypto++ library. It deletes backups and shadow copies, disables SQL Server, and drops a ransom note. Microsoft provides IOCs, detections, and security recommendations like enabling MFA, tamper protection, and investigating IOCs. Customers should harden defenses against ransomware, credential theft, and lateral movement techniques.
