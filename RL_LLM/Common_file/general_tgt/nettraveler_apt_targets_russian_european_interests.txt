The PDF describes research by Proofpoint on cyberespionage campaigns targeting Russia and neighboring countries with a malware called NetTraveler. The attackers send spearphishing emails with Word documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 or links to RAR archives containing NetTraveler. The emails use news themes and military decoys relevant to the target. NetTraveler uses DLL sideloading to persist on systems and communicates with command and control servers registered with fake domains mimicking news sites. It can exfiltrate data, download files, etc. Infrastructure analysis suggests the threat actor is China-based, with targets including government, military, and activist organizations in Russia, Mongolia, Belarus, and Europe. The campaigns demonstrate the continued reliance on proven malware like NetTraveler for cyberespionage, combined with socially engineered phishing lures. The report provides indicators of compromise and detection signatures. It highlights that NetTraveler has been an effective cyberespionage tool for over 10 years, requiring ongoing awareness, protections, and intelligence sharing to counter the threat.
