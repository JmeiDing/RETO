ESET discovered new samples of the Hacking Team's Remote Control System (RCS) spyware in the wild, used for surveillance. The samples were compiled between 2015-2017 and signed with valid certificates. Analysis shows the samples connect back to Hacking Team developers themselves, not unrelated actors reusing leaked code. Updates follow Hacking Team coding style and internal versioning. The spyware was found in 14 countries. It was distributed via spear phishing emails with PDF decoy documents. Functionality overlaps with the leaked source code. The continued development and use indicates Hacking Team has recovered from its damaging 2015 hack and data breach. The company appears to be operating and selling its surveillance tool to government clients once again. ESET states the research shows with high confidence that Hacking Team is actively updating RCS. They recommend organizations detect the new variants using specific IOCs provided and monitor networks for related activity.
