Security researchers at ESET discovered a new malware named Vyveva being used to attack a freight logistics company in South Africa. ESET attributes Vyveva to the Lazarus cybercrime group based on code similarities with the NukeSped malware Lazarus uses. Vyveva has multiple components including an installer, loader, and backdoor that communicates with a command and control server over Tor. The backdoor can exfiltrate files, gather system info, run arbitrary commands, and tamper with file timestamps. This indicates the malware is likely used for espionage. Analysis shows the installer creates a service for persistence and stores an encrypted configuration in the registry. The loader decrypts the backdoor using XOR. The backdoor features 23 commands for reconnaissance, filing manipulation, executing processes, and more. The backdoor uses a custom Tor library to talk to command servers specified in its configuration. It has watchdogs to monitor new drives and user sessions. ESET has found Vyveva samples dating back to 2018 but the initial infection vector is still unknown. ESET provides IoCs, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and recommendations for detecting this new Lazarus malware. They advise checking for the files, registry keys, and other indicators associated with Vyveva to hunt for compromises in your environment.
