The document describes a new campaign by the cyberespionage actor UAC-0056 (also known as SaintBear, UNC2589, TA471) targeting entities in Ukraine. UAC-0056 has been active since 2021, mainly targeting Ukraine and Georgia, and is believed to be behind the January 2022 wiper attacks on Ukrainian government systems. In late March 2022, the Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence Team identified new activity from this group that targeted several entities in Ukraine, including ICTV, a private TV channel. This new campaign starts with a phishing email containing a macro-embedded Excel document. When opened, the macro drops and executes a first-stage malware called Elephant Dropper. Elephant Dropper reaches out to a command and control server to download additional payloads including Elephant Downloader and Elephant Implant. Elephant Downloader maintains persistence and deploys two other malicious files - Elephant Implant and Elephant Client. Elephant Implant acts as a backdoor, communicating with the C2 to execute commands. Elephant Client is a data stealing module that exfiltrates files and collects credentials, WiFi information, browser data, etc. The payloads use the Go programming language and encryption to evade detection. Attackers put effort into obfuscating strings, encrypting C2 communications, and masking malware traffic as normal SSL/TLS. The campaign shows UAC-0056 leveraging new TTPs while continuing to aggressively target the Ukrainian government and related organizations amidst the ongoing conflict in the region.
