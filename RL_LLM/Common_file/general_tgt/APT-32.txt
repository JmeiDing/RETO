The document is about APT32, a state-sponsored cyber espionage group that targets private sector companies in Vietnam and foreign governments. It has been active since at least 2013 and uses various techniques to track the efficacy of its phishing campaigns, monitor the distribution of its malicious documents, and establish persistence mechanisms to dynamically update backdoors injected into memory. The group has also targeted dissidents, journalists, activists, and bloggers in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. It leverages cloud-based email analytics software for tracking and relies on ActiveMime lures hosted externally on legitimate cloud storage services. Its lures use several novel techniques to create persistence mechanisms and can be tracked using HTML image tags. Once macros are enabled on the target system, it creates two named scheduled tasks as persistence mechanisms for two backdoors on the infected system. The first task launches an application whitelisting script protection bypass to execute a COM scriptlet that downloads and injects the first backdoor into memory. The second task runs a JavaScript code block that downloads and launches a secondary backdoor, delivered as a multi-stage PowerShell script.
