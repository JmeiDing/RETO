The Muddy Waters of APT Attacks is a report by Check Point Research detailing recent activity by the Iranian advanced persistent threat (APT) group MuddyWater. MuddyWater has been active since at least 2017, targeting countries in the Middle East with spearphishing emails containing malicious documents. The report analyzes a new campaign targeting Belarus, Turkey and Ukraine. The initial infection vector is a spearphishing email with a weaponized Word document titled "SPK KANUN DEĞİŞİKLİĞİ GİB GÖRÜŞÜ.doc". If macros are enabled, it installs a Delphi executable that collects system info and sends it to a command and control server. The C2 responds with a PowerShell script that is likely the POWERSTATS backdoor associated with MuddyWater. Analysis of the document reveals artifacts linking it to other MuddyWater campaigns from November 2018 to January 2019. The macros and payloads share code similarities like encryption methods and function names. However, anomalies like different language lures and macro generator codes indicate the attackers are running parallel campaigns. MuddyWater continues to evolve its techniques to evade detection, adding stages to its infection chain. While its focus has been the Middle East, this shows it is expanding to target Eastern Europe. MuddyWater's motives remain unclear, but innovations like this campaign help it maintain persistence while obscuring attribution. Recommended defenses include sandboxing and zero-day protections to counter the threat group's ongoing activities.
