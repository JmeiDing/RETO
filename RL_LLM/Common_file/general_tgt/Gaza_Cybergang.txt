The document analyzes the activities of the Gaza cybergang, an Arabic-language politically-motivated cybercriminal group active since 2012. The group targets the Middle East and North Africa region, hitting government, oil/gas, media, activist, politician, and diplomat victims. The gang uses spearphishing emails with weaponized Office documents, containing malware like the Downeks downloader and Quasar/Cobaltstrike RATs, to gain remote access for spying and data theft. Lures exploit political and humanitarian crises. Recently the group compromised an oil/gas company, infiltrating systems for over a year. New technical innovations include abusing the CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability in Office and using macros in Access files to evade detection. Traces of mobile malware for Android have also been found. Attackers continuously improve their social engineering, malware, and infrastructure. The broad targeting indicates a focus on gathering regional intelligence rather than selective victimology. Defenses require security staff training, advanced threat protection, and threat intelligence to detect this persistent group.
