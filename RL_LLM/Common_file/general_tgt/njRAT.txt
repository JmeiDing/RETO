The document details research by Cybereason on a widespread malware campaign distributing the njRat remote access trojan (RAT). The attackers are spreading njRat by trojanizing hacking tools and cracked software. When users download and run these infected files, the attackers gain full control of their machines. Key points: - The attackers are posting njRat-infected versions of hacking tools on forums and websites to target other hackers. The infected tools include keygens, SQL injection tools, etc. - Compromised WordPress sites are being used to host the malware. The hackers upload njRat payloads to internal directories on vulnerable WordPress sites. - New iterations of the malware are being built daily, suggesting an automated "malware factory." Hundreds of samples have been found, targeting various software. - The malware uses multiple stages to disguise itself as a legitimate Windows process like explorer.exe. It contacts command and control servers including capeturk.com and compromised sites like anandpen.com. - PDB paths in the malware samples reveal information about how they are packed/obfuscated and contain compiled dates, indicating ongoing development. - Different subdomains are used to target different victims - some target hacking tools, others target Chrome or random programs. In summary, this is a widespread, ongoing campaign distributing njRat through trojanized hacking tools and compromised websites. The attackers gain full access to infected machines to steal data or conduct other malicious activity. The campaign uses an automated malware factory approach, repacking njRat daily into new shapes targeting various victims.
