The blog post describes a long-running surveillance campaign by Syrian state-sponsored actors distributing Android malware to monitor targets, likely in Syria and surrounding regions. The campaign has been active since early 2018 but recently started using COVID-19 themes in its lures. The malware apps impersonate legitimate apps like Telegram, Threema, and OfficeSuite. They have titles related to COVID-19 and package names alluding to Syrian targets. The command and control server IP is linked to an ISP owned by the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment, which has ties to the Syrian Electronic Army hacking group. Lookout found 71 malicious Android applications connected to the same command-and-control (C2) server. The C2 server's IP address was located in a block of addresses held by Tarassul Internet Service Provider, an ISP owned by the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment (STE). Not all applications in this campaign were completely scrubbed of sensitive information when they were created. A large portion of the malicious applications are SpyNote samples, which store C2 information, along with user inputted names, version numbers, and other information. Some AndoServer samples are purely surveillanceware that do not even pretend to be anything else, while others contain legitimate applications inside the malware, with the benign APK hidden in the res/raw folder. Many of the apps are based on the commercial SpyNote surveillanceware. They are capable of taking screenshots, recording audio, exfiltrating contacts and SMS, and more. The apps do not appear on the Google Play Store, suggesting distribution through actor-controlled sites. Some malware samples reference the name "Allosh", which has been associated before with a Syrian Electronic Army persona. The group has been active recently, claiming responsibility for DDoS and website defacements. Syria has a history of internet censorship and suppression of press freedoms. The government exercises control over telecommunications infrastructure. This likely explains the use of mobile malware to monitor citizens and opponents. In summary, the blog post analyzes an ongoing Android malware campaign by Syrian state-linked actors using COVID-19 lures to distribute surveillanceware, continuing the country's efforts to monitor and suppress political dissent.
