The report details an advanced malware operation named Aurora that was used to steal intellectual property and source code from major companies like Google and Adobe in 2009-2010. It provides extensive technical analysis of how the malware infection occurs through a JavaScript exploit in Internet Explorer 6, drops malicious files on the system, and installs a backdoor trojan payload. The backdoor communicates over HTTPS to command servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data. The malware uses multiple stages and encryption to hide its activity. File names and service names are randomized. The report covers in depth how to detect the malware through memory forensics, network monitoring, and other means. Though malware code patterns indicate Chinese origin, there is no definitive proof the Chinese government was behind the attacks. Likely it was a skilled independent hacking group. Aurora shows the capabilities of advanced malware operations even several years ago. Recommendations are made for security products to detect, analyze, and respond to infections.
