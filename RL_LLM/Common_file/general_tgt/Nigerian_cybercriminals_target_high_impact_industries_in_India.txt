The document describes cybercrime campaigns originating from Nigeria that target high-impact industries like manufacturing, shipping, and transportation in India. The attackers use spear phishing emails with malware like Pony and Hawkeye to steal credentials and gain access to systems. Rather than just stealing data, they manually review compromised accounts to find additional targets. This gives them access to sensitive corporate data including financial transactions, tracking info for vehicles and vessels, and intellectual property. The potential impact goes beyond just data theft to physical disruption of cargo and transport. Analysis found the attackers set up Pony infrastructure using domains mimicking legitimate companies. The Pony panels harvest credentials from infected systems. Some binaries use the DarkEyE Protector crypter. Attribution points to a specific actor named Louis Onyeka based in Nigeria. His online aliases include "Waxxy" and "Onyeb4Real." He registers domains and sends phishing emails. The report recommends protections like Cylance that use AI to block unknown malware and prevent the infections at the root cause. Legacy antivirus cannot reliably detect new threats in these ongoing campaigns. It highlights the risk from well-resourced and persistent threat actors out of Nigeria and other countries beyond the typical major state sponsors.
