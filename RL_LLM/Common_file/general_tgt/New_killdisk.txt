The PDF describes a new variant of the destructive malware KillDisk that is targeting financial organizations in Latin America. KillDisk is known for deleting and overwriting files to render systems inoperable. This new variant has been detected as TROJ_KILLDISK.IUB by Trend Micro. The malware first randomly renames files before overwriting the first 0x2800 bytes and another 0x2800 byte block with 0x00. It then deletes the files. It also overwrites the Master Boot Record (MBR) of storage devices with 0x00 to damage the partitions and prevent booting. After the overwrite and deletion actions, the malware has a hardcoded wait time of 15 minutes by default before it forcefully reboots the system by terminating critical processes like csrss.exe, wininit.exe, winlogon.exe, and lsass.exe. This is likely intended to cause a Blue Screen of Death and force a reboot. The PDF analysis is still ongoing but initial findings suggest this variant may be part of a larger attack package. Recommendations for protection include keeping systems patched and updated, regularly backing up data, enforcing privilege principles, deploying security tools like whitelisting and behavior monitoring, and having an incident response plan. Trend Micro's XGen security platform is highlighted as having capabilities like machine learning, custom sandboxing, and web filtering that can secure networks and endpoints against threats like KillDisk.
