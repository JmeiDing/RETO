The report describes a cyberespionage campaign named Operation Spy Cloud conducted by a North Korean threat group called Geumseong121. The group has been actively targeting South Korean organizations and individuals related to national security, unification efforts, North Korean issues, and North Korean defectors. The campaign uses spear-phishing emails containing malicious document files that trick users into enabling macros. The macros contain obfuscated shellcode that connects to a Google Drive account used for command and control. It downloads an encrypted backdoor module which exfiltrates system info and can install additional malware. Analysis shows the Google Drive account and cloud services used for exfiltration were registered with email accounts linked to previous Geumseong121 campaigns. The malware payloads and document exploit techniques also overlap, indicating this is the same group. Geumseong121 has continuously conducted cyber espionage against South Korea using evolving tactics like mobile malware and strategic web compromises. But their tools, infrastructure, and targeting remain consistent. The report concludes threat intelligence sharing and proactive security is key to defend against sophisticated state-backed groups like Geumseong121 as they continue attacks.
