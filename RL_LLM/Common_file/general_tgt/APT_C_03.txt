The report describes cyber-espionage campaigns called Operation OnionDog from 2013-2015 targeting organizations in Korea. The attackers used spearphishing emails with HWP document exploits and USB worms to infect systems. The malware communicated with C2 servers via Tor domain Onion.City for covertness. Campaigns occurred annually, lasted around 2 weeks, and targeted critical infrastructure sectors. ICEFOG malware was found but not used, likely to mislead researchers about the threat actor. Tactics like coherent PDB paths and Korean language artifacts suggest an organized, deceptive attacker.
