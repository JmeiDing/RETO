The PDF analyzes a ransomware attack on several core servers that was linked to Chinese state-sponsored groups APT27 and Winnti. Initial access was gained by compromising a third party provider. The attackers used various malware including the ASPXSpy webshell, PlugX, Mimikatz, and a custom backdoor called Clambling. Clambling appears to be an older variant lacking Dropbox command and control features found in other versions. Notably, the attackers leveraged BitLocker encryption rather than traditional ransomware to lock down the servers. While financially-motivated attacks are unusual for APT27, the shift aligns with the COVID-19 pandemic impact in China. Strong links exist between the attack and APT27 in terms of code reuse and TTPs like DLL side-loading. But target industry and infrastructure links better match Winnti. Evidence suggests Clambling could originate from a Winnti subgroup based on code configuration reuse from previous attacks. Overall, the report highlights APT27's novel use of ransomware tactics and the blurring lines between state-sponsored and financially-motivated threat groups. While attribution remains unclear between APT27 and Winnti, the attack leveraged trusted third party access, Living off the Land tactics, and purpose-built malware to effectively encrypt and ransom the victim's servers.
