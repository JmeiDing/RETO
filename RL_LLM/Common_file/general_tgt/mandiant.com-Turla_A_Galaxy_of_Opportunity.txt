Here is a summary of the key points from the Mandiant report on the Turla hacking group's operations in Ukraine: The cybersecurity firm Mandiant discovered in September 2022 that the Russia-linked hacking group Turla was distributing malware to victims in Ukraine by hijacking the infrastructure of an older commodity malware called Andromeda. Andromeda is a widespread malware that spreads via infected USB drives. Turla re-registered several expired Andromeda command and control domains to profile victims and selectively deploy additional payloads. After months of monitoring, Turla used one of the hijacked domains to deploy a reconnaissance tool called Kopiluwak on a compromised Ukrainian system. Kopiluwak profiled the system's network connections, processes, disks, etc. Two days later, Turla deployed a lightweight backdoor called Quietcanary on the same system. Quietcanary was used to collect and exfiltrate documents and data from the victim's machine. Turla appeared to only exfiltrate files created after a certain date, suggesting they were focused on gathering recent strategic information. While Turla has used tools like Kopiluwak before, this campaign shows their effort to gain access in Ukraine since the invasion by hijacking old malware infrastructure. However, some sloppy practices like redeploying Kopiluwak multiple times suggest potential deficiencies in Turla's current operations. Overall, the report highlights how advanced hacking groups like Turla are opportunistically compromising victims in Ukraine by creatively reusing old malware toolsets.
