The PDF describes an ongoing hacking campaign dubbed "OilRig" targeting organizations in Saudi Arabia, primarily in the financial, technology, and defense sectors. The attacks involve spear-phishing emails with malicious Excel attachments that install a remote access trojan called Helminth. There are two main variants of Helminth observed: A VBScript/PowerShell version delivered via macros in the Excel docs. This variant communicates with the C2 server via HTTP requests and DNS queries. It can download and execute scripts, upload data, and provide a remote shell. An executable version typically delivered via social engineering. This variant has similar functionality to the script version but also includes a keylogger module. It communicates via HTTP and DNS like the script version. The attacks are highly targeted, with the malware containing hardcoded "group" and "name" fields referring to specific organizations in Saudi Arabia. Some filenames and strings in the malware suggest possible Iranian origin. There were two waves of attacks delivering the different Helminth variants. The infrastructure analysis shows some overlap between the waves, suggesting the same threat actor controlling both. The OilRig campaign demonstrates an adversary that can adapt their tactics, using different malware variants and delivery techniques to maintain access to targets across separate waves of attacks. The targeting of key industries in Saudi Arabia indicates a highly motivated and resourceful threat actor.
