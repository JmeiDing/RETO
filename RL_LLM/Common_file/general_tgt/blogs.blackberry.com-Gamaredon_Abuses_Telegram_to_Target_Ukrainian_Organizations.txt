The PDF describes research by BlackBerry into a new campaign by the threat actor group Gamaredon targeting Ukrainian organizations. Gamaredon is using Telegram infrastructure for command and control to bypass detection. The group sends weaponized documents to victims that fetch a VBS script if the IP is Ukrainian. The VBS reaches out to a Telegram account that provides an IP address for the next stage PowerShell loader. This loader gets another IP from a different Telegram channel and downloads the final payload. The PDF provides technical analysis of the obfuscated macro, VBS, and PowerShell scripts used in the attack chain. It tracks the Telegram accounts and IPs involved, many tied to infrastructure in Crimea. The campaign relies on staged Telegram C2 to profile then infect targets in Ukraine. The PDF concludes that Gamaredon is abusing Telegram's popularity in the region for covert command and control. The staged approach and IP rotation makes analysis and tracking difficult. Gamaredon continues to target strategic sectors in Ukraine with evolving techniques.
