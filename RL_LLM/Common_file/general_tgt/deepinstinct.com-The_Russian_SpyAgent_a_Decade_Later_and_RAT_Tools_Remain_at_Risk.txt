The Deep Instinct Threat Lab has observed changes in the distribution and evolution of the SpyAgent malware (also known as TeamSpy/TVRat/TeamBot/Sheldor) over the past decade. SpyAgent is a malware that abuses legitimate remote access tools (RATs) like TeamViewer and Safib Assistant. SpyAgent originated over 10 years ago but has continuously evolved. Recently, the malware authors have changed distribution methods to stay stealthy and bypass security products. For example, they are distributing large 700MB+ files to evade scanning limits and only downloading SpyAgent bundled with Safib Assistant rather than multiple malware families. The large overlayed executables are droppers which use Microsoft's .NET ClickOnce launch utility "AppLaunch.exe" to download and execute malware files from the web. SpyAgent works by hooking functions used by the legitimate RAT applications to obtain session IDs, disable logging, and hide the GUI. This allows the malware operators to secretly take over the infected machine. The malware communicates with a C&C server to receive commands. The Deep Instinct researchers confirmed that a sample they analyzed connects to a C&C domain "thief[.]lol" which resolves to 185.125.206[.]172. The panel allows the attackers to control infected machines. SpyAgent and other dual-use remote access tools remain a threat even though they are legitimate software. They can be used maliciously without additional malware. Deep Instinct blocks suspicious applications like Safib Assistant. The key points are that SpyAgent has evolved over 10+ years to stay stealthy, it hijacks legitimate RATs to covertly control machines, and remote access tools in general pose an ongoing threat even without malware. Security products need advanced methods to detect these attacks.
