In July 2022, a ransomware named ROADSWEEP was used to target Albanian government organizations. The ransom note suggested political motivations related to an Iranian opposition group. Around the same time, an front named "HomeLand Justice" claimed responsibility for the disruptive activity on Albanian government websites. They posted a video of the ransomware execution and documents allegedly stolen from the government. Analysis uncovered links between ROADSWEEP and a backdoor named CHIMNEYSWEEP which has targeted Farsi and Arabic speakers since 2012. CHIMNEYSWEEP uses Telegram or attacker infrastructure for command and control. It can take screenshots, collect files, spawn a reverse shell, and more. The ZEROCLEAR wiper has also been publicly linked to Iranian actors, and a variant was submitted from Albania after the disruptions. The report assesses with moderate confidence that one or more Iranian threat actors are likely behind the activity due to timing, targeting, content themes, and tools used. The geographic expansion to disrupt a NATO member state may indicate an increased risk tolerance by Iran when employing disruptive cyber operations against perceived opponents. Defenders are advised to monitor for the indicators, malware, and behaviors associated with this activity as outlined in the report.
