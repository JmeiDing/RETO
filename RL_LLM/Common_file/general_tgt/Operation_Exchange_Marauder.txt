The PDF discusses active exploitation of multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange servers that began in early January 2021. Attackers were using a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability (CVE-2021-26855) to steal emails without authentication and a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2021-27065) to install web shells and move laterally. The SSRF vulnerability allows attackers to send crafted requests to download emails from targeted mailboxes without any authentication needed other than knowing the email address. Chaining this with the RCE vulnerability allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on Exchange servers to install ASPX web shells, dump credentials, add user accounts, and steal AD databases. Volexity observed these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild starting January 6, 2021. The attacks appear targeted for cyber espionage, conducted by multiple groups using varied tools for post-exploitation activities. Indicators of compromise are provided including suspicious user agents, URIs, and IP addresses associated with exploitation. Patches for the vulnerabilities are expected soon. Organizations are urged to apply them immediately or temporarily disable external Microsoft Exchange access given active in-the-wild attacks. The summary provides technical details on the vulnerabilities and associated attacker activities derived from incident response investigations and monitoring network traffic.
