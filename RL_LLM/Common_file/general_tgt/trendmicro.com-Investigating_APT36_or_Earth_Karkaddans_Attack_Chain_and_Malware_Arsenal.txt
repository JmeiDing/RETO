The PDF describes research by Trend Micro on the cyberespionage group APT36, also known as Earth Karkaddan. This group targets Indian military and diplomatic resources using spear-phishing emails containing malware like Crimson RAT and ObliqueRAT. The emails use lures like fake government documents, profiles of attractive women, and COVID-19 information to get victims to download malware. The malware is hidden in attachments that use macros to decrypt and execute the RATs. The RATs can exfiltrate data, download other malware, and more. Earth Karkaddan has also used Android malware like CapraRAT, which has similarities to their Windows malware. CapraRAT can record audio, access contacts, location, etc. on compromised phones. The group uses social engineering and constantly evolves their lures and malware. Trend Micro found crossover in capabilities between the group's Windows and Android malware. They also identified reuse of domains, certificates, and other IT infrastructure. For defense, Trend Micro recommends security awareness training, not opening unsolicited emails/attachments, using antispam and threat blocking, only installing apps from trusted sources, and using multilayered endpoint, email, and mobile security solutions. Specific products are listed that can help protect against these types of cyberespionage attacks. In summary, the PDF provides an overview of the tactics, tools, and procedures used by APT36/Earth Karkaddan and recommendations for security teams to defend against this group's constantly evolving attacks.
