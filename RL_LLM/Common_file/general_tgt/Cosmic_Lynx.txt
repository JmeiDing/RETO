The PDF describes the tactics and infrastructure of a Russian business email compromise (BEC) group called Cosmic Lynx. Since July 2019, Cosmic Lynx has conducted over 200 BEC campaigns targeting large multinational corporations across 46 countries. Cosmic Lynx attacks involve a CEO impersonator asking the target employee to work with an external lawyer to coordinate payments for a fake corporate acquisition. The "lawyer" is an impersonated identity of a real lawyer at a UK law firm. The pretext gives Cosmic Lynx opportunities for dual impersonation and spoofing. Unlike typical BEC groups, Cosmic Lynx employs custom email infrastructure mimicking security products, manipulates DNS records, and uses bulletproof hosting for anonymity. Their infrastructure overlaps with Android malware, Trickbot and Emotet banking trojans, and Russian fake document sites. Cosmic Lynx requests large sums, prefers Hong Kong accounts, and avoids US accounts. They exploit DMARC controls, adapt social engineering to current events, and have targeted executives across industries in a wide range of countries. Evidence suggests Cosmic Lynx originates from Russia, including Moscow Standard Time in headers, Serge Devant metadata, and links to Eastern European cybercrime. The group's technical sophistication exceeds typical BEC actors. In summary, the report provides an in-depth profile of an active, creative, and globally threatening BEC group demonstrating greater sophistication than common BEC attacks. It details their tactics, infrastructure, targeting, and likely Russian origins.
