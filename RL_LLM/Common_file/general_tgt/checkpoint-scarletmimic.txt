The PDF describes a 7-year long mobile surveillance campaign called Scarlet Mimic that has targeted the Uyghur minority community. The threat actor has used over 20 variations of Android spyware called MobileOrder disguised as Uyghur-related content like books, pictures, and audio files. The malware can steal sensitive data from infected devices like location, SMS, calls, files, and can also perform active commands like taking photos, recording audio, manipulating SMS/calls, and installing additional malware. The malware has evolved over time to evade detection, with the actors experimenting with hiding malicious strings in resources and encoding them. New features have also been added like real-time location tracking. The malware uses AES encryption to communicate with command and control servers, which can be hardcoded in the malware or retrieved from "dead drop" resolvers on blog sites. The actors have continuously updated the malware and used social engineering to distribute it through lures like Uyghur-related photos and documents, indicating an ongoing successful campaign. Based on code overlaps, infrastructure, and targeting, the campaign has been attributed to the Scarlet Mimic group which has previously targeted this community on Windows and MacOS. The shift to mobile malware aligns with a growing trend of mobile surveillance. The technical analysis provides an in-depth look at how the malware functions for exfiltrating data and manipulating the compromised device.
