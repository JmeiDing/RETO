The PDF describes a new modular backdoor malware called BumbleBee that was investigated starting in March 2021. BumbleBee has a unique layered architecture and modular framework that makes analysis challenging. It is comprised of a client application that gets installed on target devices, and a controller server application. The client application uses a layered deployment method, abusing a legitimate executable to load a side-loaded DLL, which then decrypts and executes shellcode containing the main malicious modules. The installer module establishes persistence and deletes original files. Encrypted payloads are decrypted at runtime using a key derived from the infected system. The server application allows threat actors to control compromised devices remotely. It supports functions like file management, command execution, keylogging, etc. Communications between client and server are encrypted using RC4 and LZO algorithms. BumbleBee shares many similarities with an older backdoor called BookWorm, leading researchers to believe it is a refactored version of BookWorm. Both have targeted local governments in Asia. Other common TTPs include modular architecture, encryption methods, and victimology. This suggests BumbleBee may originate from a Chinese hacking group. BumbleBee's modular design makes it flexible and extensible for attackers to add new capabilities without rewriting the entire malware. The initial malware has limited functionality to evade detection, but modules can expand functionality later. Advanced protections are needed to detect and block this sophisticated backdoor malware.
