The report from China's National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center provides technical analysis of the FOXACID cyberespionage platform used by the NSA's Tailored Access Operations (TAO) group. FOXACID is an exploit kit that enables man-in-the-middle attacks, reconnaissance, automated exploitation, and payload delivery. It integrates with other NSA tools like QUANTUM and SECONDDATE to hack targets worldwide, especially in China and Russia. The platform has a distributed architecture of servers for different functions like spam, MITM attacks, and post-exploitation. It can exploit vulnerabilities in browsers and mobile operating systems to deploy spyware payloads like Validator, MistyVeal, and SECONDDATE. FOXACID allows TAO operators to hijack sessions, scan for valuable data, select optimal exploits, and install persistent malware. Custom filters tailor the attack chain based on reconnaissance of the target system. The report reveals the inner workings of FOXACID, including its team structure, infrastructure deployment, wrapped payloads, and real code samples. It exposes operations targeting entities in China, Russia, the Middle East, and Pakistan. The report concludes that FOXACID poses a major global threat as it facilitates mass surveillance and potential critical infrastructure sabotage by the NSA and its partners. It warns that organizations worldwide may be unwitting victims and encourages awareness to counter this powerful cyberweapon.
