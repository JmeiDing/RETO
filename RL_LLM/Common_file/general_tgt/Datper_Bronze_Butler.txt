The document describes campaigns conducted by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as Tick, Redbaldknight, or Bronze Butler that has targeted South Korea and Japan since 2016. The group uses custom malware tools in its campaigns, including Datper, xxmm backdoor, and Emdivi. Though the malware families are different, Talos researchers found infrastructure overlaps indicating links between them. For example, some campaigns use compromised legitimate websites located in South Korea and Japan as command and control servers. Also, different campaign servers resolved to the same IP addresses. In the recent 2018 Datper campaign, the actor compromised a Korean laundry website to host the command server. Datper gathers system info from victims and makes requests to the command server. Prior campaigns used similar mutexes, suggesting code reuse. Infrastructure overlaps also exist between Datper and the xxmm backdoor family. Both have used the same compromised Japanese websites for command servers since 2016. Finally, a Datper variant and Emdivi malware attributed to the "Blue Termite" campaign used the same IP address for command servers in 2018. Passive DNS lookups confirm the IP was used by both malware families. In summary, infrastructure analysis by Talos reveals connections between the custom malware families used by this persistent threat actor targeting East Asia over multiple years. The malware allows remote access, exfiltration of data, and further malware installation.
