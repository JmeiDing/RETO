The Anomali Threat Research Team discovered a phishing campaign targeting the Chinese government and organizations. The phishers created fake login pages impersonating Chinese government agencies and state-owned enterprises to steal email credentials. Over 40 subdomains were found impersonating 4 government agencies, 6 state-owned enterprises, an auction house, and email providers. The phishing sites used valid SSL certificates and had similar subdomain naming conventions. Analysis uncovered the campaign has been active since at least May 2019 and employs domains registered with fake organization names that resolve to Icelandic hosting providers known for privacy. The domains were previously identified by Chinese security firm CERT 360 as associated with an alleged Indian APT group called BITTER APT, which primarily targets China, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The motivation appears to be espionage, as the targeted organizations deal with economic trade, defense, aviation and foreign relations. By stealing email credentials the attackers could gain insights into Chinese government decision making and access sensitive information. The victims are staff members of the organizations being impersonated in the phishing campaign.
