The document is a Malware Analysis Report (MAR) from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) analyzing a malware variant named TAIDOOR used by Chinese government cyber actors. Key points: - TAIDOOR is a remote access trojan (RAT) that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access and control over a victim's computer. - It has both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows versions. It is installed as a DLL service that decrypts and executes the main RAT payload in memory. - It uses complex encryption and decryption routines to conceal its network communications and payload. The malware connects to command and control servers to receive commands from the attacker. - Analysis provides technical details on TAIDOOR's encryption algorithms, network communications, payload capabilities, and artifacts left on the infected system. - Provides IOCs, YARA rules, and Snort rules to detect TAIDOOR malware. Recommends mitigation techniques like keeping software updated, using antivirus, restricting user permissions, and monitoring network activity. - CISA recommends reporting any activity related to TAIDOOR or other suspicious malware to cybersecurity authorities. The report aims to enable network defense against this malicious threat.
