The document is an analysis by CERT Intrinsec of an intrusion by the APT27 cyber threat group (also known as LuckyMouse or EmissaryPanda) into a company's network. In Spring 2022, the company discovered one of its devices communicating with a known C2 server. CERT Intrinsec's investigation found APT27 had compromised the network for over a year via exploiting a public-facing Microsoft Exchange server. The initial intrusion occurred on March 4, 2021 by exploiting the ProxyLogon vulnerabilities in Exchange. This allowed remote code execution to drop webshells and malware like the HyperBro remote access trojan. Over the next 9 months, APT27 moved laterally to compromise 5 different domains within the company's network. They used reconnaissance like PowerShell scripts to map hosts, users, and policies. They stole credentials with tools like Mimikatz. In the 11th month, APT27 began exfiltrating large volumes of data - nearly 3 TB over 17 days. The data was business-related documents, personal info, and technical data. It was archived locally then staged and exfiltrated out via the Exchange server. APT27 used various techniques to hide their activity, like disabling security tools, deleting files, masquerading tasks/services, and proxy tools like Chisel. The analysis includes timelines, diagrams of the attack, and recommendations like stronger passwords, monitoring for C2 traffic, hardening AD trusts, applying patches, etc.
