The PDF describes the activities of a North Korean cyber threat group called Andariel, which is a subgroup of the Lazarus Group. Andariel has been active since at least 2015 and conducts cyber espionage and financially-motivated attacks. Andariel primarily targets South Korean military, government, critical infrastructure, and commercial entities. Its main attack vectors are spear phishing emails with malware-laden documents, watering hole attacks exploiting vulnerabilities like ActiveX, supply chain compromises, and exploiting vulnerabilities in widely used IT management software in South Korea. Andariel uses custom malware like Andaratm, Rifdoor, and Phandoor as well as modified publicly available malware like Gh0st RAT. The group tailors its attacks to the South Korean computing environment and Korean language. Andariel was likely responsible for several major cyber attacks in South Korea from 2015-2018, including: - Attacks on defense contractors and exhibitors at a defense industry trade show in 2015. - Theft of certificates and source code from a South Korean security company in 2016. - Mass compromise of South Korean defense industry firms by exploiting IT management software in 2016. - Theft of classified military documents by compromising anti-virus management software in 2016. - Attacks on ATMs and theft of credit card data in 2017. - Attacks on South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges in late 2017 and 2018. - Theft of customer data from a major South Korean travel agency through a vendor compromise. Andariel shares tactics, techniques, and procedures with other North Korean groups, suggesting cooperation or a shared mission. AhnLab, the cybersecurity company that authored this report, recommends that South Korean firms take measures to secure IT management software, monitor internal networks, and implement robust security policies to defend against Andariel.
