The report analyzes ties between the threat actor group STONE PANDA (also known as APT10) and China's Ministry of State Security (MSS). It examines information released by a group called IntrusionTruth that names specific individuals linked to STONE PANDA operations. Details like domain registrations, social media accounts, GitHub repositories, and Uber receipts connect two individuals, Gao Qiang and Zhang Shilong, to STONE PANDA activities. The report explores their associations with Chinese hacking forums, malware tools, and technology companies. One company, Huaying Haitai, hired graduates with Japanese language skills, which aligns with STONE PANDA's targeting of Japanese firms. Its links to government-sponsored cyber competitions resemble the defense lab connections of another MSS-linked group, GOTHIC PANDA. While definitive proof is lacking, the evidence suggests STONE PANDA may be an MSS contractor under the Tianjin Bureau. The report aims to illuminate these potential connections to advance attribution and intelligence on Chinese state-sponsored groups like STONE PANDA.
