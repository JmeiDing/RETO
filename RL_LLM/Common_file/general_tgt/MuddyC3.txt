The PDF is from QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center and analyzes a tool called MuddyC3 that is associated with the threat actor group MuddyWater. MuddyWater is an active APT group targeting organizations in the Middle East. In early 2019, they conducted attacks against government, education, financial, telecom, and defense organizations in several countries. In May 2019, a threat actor claimed to possess attack data on MuddyWater and leaked an image of a web control server called MuddyC3. The version number was 1.0.0. QiAnXin analyzed two samples of MuddyC3 - versions 1.0.0 and 1.0.1. It is built using Python and PyInstaller. MuddyC3 is a command and control tool that allows delivering next stage payloads, uploading and downloading files, collecting system information, and using modules. It supports commands like list, show, use, and payload. The tool uses a web.py server to communicate with compromised hosts. Different API paths are used in the two versions. MuddyC3 allows MuddyWater to maintain persistent access and control on a compromised system for further attacks. It serves as a post-exploitation framework. The analyzed samples did not contain default PowerShell payload code so the specific payloads delivered are unknown. MuddyC3 appears to be an early prototype tool used by MuddyWater that evolved into a more complete post-exploitation framework. The leaks provide insight into the group's tactics.
