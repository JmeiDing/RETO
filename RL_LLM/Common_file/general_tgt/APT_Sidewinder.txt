APT Sidewinder, a new backdoor developed by Sebdraven, has changed their techniques to install their backdoor. A malicious RTF exploits CVE-2017-11882 to download an HTA file that checks for antivirus before continuing. The backdoor is written in VBScript and uses the 8EBECD7C.dll (modified msvbvm60.dll) to sideload itself into memory. The backdoor gives up the powershell in the HTA and all stuff is written in vbs. The goal of this change is to be more furtive. The HTA file checks with WMI the Antivirus Installed and sends the information on the C2. If the AV are installed, the script is stopped. The chains infections have changed a bit. In the HTA file, there is a zip file. The HTA contains a zipped executable that is extracted and launched as the backdoor Srvstr.exe with registry persistence. Srvstr.exe sideloads a modified DLL that executes the final backdoor payload. The backdoor payload was developed in VB and communicates with the attacker's command and control server.
