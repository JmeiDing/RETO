The document provides a technical analysis of a malware family called Prikormka that has been used since at least 2008 in targeted cyberattacks, primarily against individuals in Ukraine. Prikormka is a modular remote access trojan that allows attackers to surveil and steal sensitive data from infected computers. The report examines Prikormka's infection tactics, architecture, and capabilities. Infection often starts with spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments. The malware uses multiple techniques to maintain persistence on systems. A core module handles command and control communication to download additional modules that harvest different types of data, like documents, keystrokes, and screenshots. Encryption and other anti-detection methods are used. Prikormka has largely flown under the radar due to its use in highly targeted attacks. But infections spiked in 2015, with Ukraine by far the most impacted country. The primary targets are pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian government officials, journalists, and other high-profile individuals. Technical clues like language artifacts, command and control servers, and activity patterns suggest the attackers are Ukrainian and likely operate within the country to conduct surveillance. The modular malware provides access to a robust surveillance toolkit, allowing persistent monitoring of victims through their own devices. In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at a long-running cyberespionage operation that has adapted over time to provide attackers with remote access to devices belonging to selected individuals of interest within Ukraine.
