The document describes a campaign called Operation Overtrap that has been targeting Japanese online banking users since April 2019. It uses three attack vectors: - Spam emails with phishing links to fake banking sites - Spam emails distributing malware executables - A custom exploit kit called BottleEK that delivers malware via malvertising Operation Overtrap drops a new banking trojan called Cinobi, which has four stages. Cinobi checks the device language, downloads Tor and other tools, connects to a C2 server, and injects itself into browser processes for form grabbing and web injects. The BottleEK exploit kit exploits Flash and VBScript vulnerabilities to infect victims who visit the landing page with unpatched browsers. It was the most active exploit kit in Japan in February 2020. The report concludes with mitigations like patch management, multi-layered endpoint protection, network security, employee training, and cloud email security to defend against the various attack vectors used by Operation Overtrap campaigns.
