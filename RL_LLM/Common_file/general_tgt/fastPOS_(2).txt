The report describes a point-of-sale (PoS) malware called FastPOS that quickly steals credit card information. FastPOS spreads via compromised websites, file sharing services, or direct transfer using stolen VNC credentials. It immediately sends any stolen data to a command and control (C&C) server rather than saving locally. FastPOS uses keylogging to capture all keystrokes, including credentials and payment info. A RAM scraper searches memory specifically for valid magnetic stripe card data that passes verification checks. Exfiltration happens via HTTP GET requests to a hardcoded C&C URL, unlike the more common POST requests. This results in the stolen card data being exposed in plaintext on the network and in browser cache. Analysis uncovered possible links between FastPOS and cybercriminal forums where stolen cards are advertised and sold. Infections were seen globally across various industries including veterinary clinics, food companies, and logistics providers. The immediate exfiltration of stolen card data rather than periodic uploads suggests FastPOS is designed for small environments like PoS systems with direct internet access. Solutions like application control, network monitoring, and endpoint security can help defend against POS malware like FastPOS.
