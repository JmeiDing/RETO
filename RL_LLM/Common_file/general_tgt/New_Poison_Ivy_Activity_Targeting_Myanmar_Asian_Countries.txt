The cybersecurity company Arbor Networks observed new activity involving the Poison Ivy remote access trojan (RAT) malware targeting several Asian countries over the past year. Technical analysis shows this Poison Ivy variant, nicknamed "Korplug", uses DLL sideloading to infect systems. It drops decoy documents hinting at targets, a DLL, and a shellcode file. The malware copies a legitimate Windows executable to load the DLL which decrypts configuration data and connects to command and control servers. Decoy documents suggest targeting of pro-democracy groups in Myanmar around recent elections. Other documents reference ASEAN meetings and members, hinting at targeting of Southeast Asian government and military organizations. Additional decoy documents are written in Korean and Mongolian languages. Infrastructure analysis reveals overlaps between this Poison Ivy activity and other malware families including Gh0strat and Nitol, suggesting possible coordination by a shared threat actor. The malware continues to evolve with new configurations and artifacts likely designed to evade defenses. Arbor Networks assesses that Poison Ivy remains an active threat, with new variants being used in targeted campaigns across Asia by motivated actors. They recommend monitoring systems for related indicators of compromise and ensuring protections against known Poison Ivy malware capabilities.
