The document provides an in-depth analysis of the Gh0st remote access Trojan (RAT), a sophisticated malware tool used by cybercriminals for remote control of compromised systems. It covers how the various Gh0st RAT components work together - a device driver, Windows service DLL, installer, and command and control client. These give it capabilities like keylogging, screen capture, file transfers, and terminal access. The malware uses multiple encryption schemes and resets the kernel to evade security tools. The report analyzes the source code and network communications in detail. It outlines how Gh0st RAT infects systems, installs persistently as a service, and connects to a command server to receive instructions from an attacker controlling it. The report discusses defenses like monitoring network traffic, services, DNS requests, and logs to detect indicators of compromise from Gh0st RAT activity. It stresses the importance of user education since phishing is a main infection vector. Though the analyzed version is dated, the author notes that Gh0st RAT illustrates the advanced capabilities of remote access Trojans still used by cybercriminals today. Defenders must understand such threats to implement effective countermeasures.
