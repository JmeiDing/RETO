The document provides additional insights and indicators of compromise related to the Shamoon2 malware attacks against Saudi Arabia. Researchers discovered new malicious documents, domains, IP addresses, and artifacts related to the distribution of Shamoon2. The basic functionality matches what was previously disclosed about the malware. New indicators suggest possible connections between Shamoon2 and Iranian state-sponsored threat actors, supporting analysis that Iran was behind the Shamoon2 attacks. One sample dates back to September 2016, earlier than most other known Shamoon2 samples, suggesting it may have been involved in early development. The domains, IPs, and URLs disclosed provide additional context about the threat and can help network defenders discover and mitigate related compromises. Sharing these new indicators of compromise can assist incident response efforts and analysis of the Shamoon2 campaign attributed to Iranian state-sponsored actors.
