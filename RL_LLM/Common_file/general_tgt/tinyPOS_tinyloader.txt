The report analyzes how the TinyLoader backdoor distributes and upgrades two POS malware strains - AbaddonPOS and TinyPOS. TinyLoader performs reconnaissance on infected systems and delivers appropriate secondary payloads. It first distributed AbaddonPOS variants starting November 2015, impacting systems in Asia Pacific and Europe. In January 2016, TinyPOS infections also spiked, suggesting the two POS malwares are linked. Analysis shows TinyLoader manages upgrades for both AbaddonPOS and TinyPOS. It uses selective deployment to test AbaddonPOS updates before mass distribution. TinyPOS infections are seen in the US and Europe but not yet widespread. The common distribution method and upgrade process implies the operators behind AbaddonPOS and TinyPOS are the same threat actor. TinyLoader serves as a software suite for deploying, managing and upgrading the POS malware strains. The report provides an overview of how the three components TinyLoader, AbaddonPOS and TinyPOS work together to infect systems and evade detection. It notes that TinyLoader infections are not the sole indicator of POS malware presence. Trend Micro endpoint and network security products can detect and block the threats.
