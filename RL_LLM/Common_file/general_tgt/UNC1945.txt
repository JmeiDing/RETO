The report describes the activities of a threat actor group tracked as UNC1945 by Mandiant researchers. UNC1945 targeted financial and professional consulting organizations by compromising managed service providers and moving laterally through networks. Initial access was gained in late 2018 by exploiting a Solaris server exposed to the internet. The actor used custom backdoors like SLAPSTICK and LEMONSTICK to establish persistence. A zero-day exploit called EVILSUN was used to compromise Solaris servers. UNC1945 escalated privileges using stolen credentials collected by SLAPSTICK and tools like Mimikatz. They moved laterally through networks via RDP and SSH. Virtual machines with hacking tools were deployed to avoid detection. Anti-forensics tools like LOGBLEACH were used to manipulate timestamps and delete logs. The custom malware STEELCORGI used environment variables as decryption keys. While internal reconnaissance was conducted with tools like Luckscan/BlueKeep, no data exfiltration was observed. ROLLCOAST ransomware was deployed in some cases. UNC1945 demonstrated technical sophistication, utilizing exploits, custom malware, virtual machines, and advanced lateral movement techniques. Their motivations appear to be gaining and selling access rather than conducting cyber espionage or data theft.
