The report details an attack campaign by the Lazarus cybercrime group targeting the defense industry using malware called ThreatNeedle. The initial infection vector was spear-phishing emails with COVID-19 themes containing malicious Word docs. The malware went through multiple stages to install the final ThreatNeedle backdoor for remote access. The attackers gathered credentials and moved laterally through the network to find valuable assets. They were able to bypass network segmentation by compromising a router VM and using it as a proxy server to exfiltrate data from an isolated intranet. Custom tunneling tools were used to create covert channels for data theft. Connections were found between this campaign and previous Lazarus operations like DeathNote, AppleJeus, and Bookcode. Over a dozen countries have been affected. The report provides indicators of compromise and maps the attack lifecycle to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. It concludes that Lazarus remains a highly prolific and sophisticated group actively targeting various industries including defense for cyberespionage.
