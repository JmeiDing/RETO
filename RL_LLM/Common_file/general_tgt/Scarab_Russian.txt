The document analyzes a threat group called Scarab that has been conducting targeted attacks against specific Russian-speaking individuals since at least January 2012. The attackers typically target a small number of individuals using economic, military, topical, or generic lures. - Scarab's campaigns involve sending emails with malicious attachments that exploit older vulnerabilities to distribute custom malware like Trojan.Scieron and Trojan.Scieron.B. - The attacks are highly targeted, infecting less than 10 computers per month on average. Scarab does not try to spread through the victim's network. - Analysis indicates the attackers are familiar with Chinese language but target Russian speakers, both in Russia and abroad. - Early campaigns focused on retail and academic targets. In 2013, they targeted finance organizations and governments related to the G20 summits. - From 2014 onwards, Scarab switched to using Russian-language news article titles as bait in malware file names, continuing to target Russian speakers. - The custom Trojan malware gathers system info, downloads files, and executes commands on the infected machine. Trojan.Scieron.B has enhanced features like a rootkit. - Symantec products detect and block Scarab's emails and malware. Recommended practices include caution with emails, avoiding suspicious links/attachments, and keeping software updated. In summary, Scarab is a persistent, targeted threat group focused on compromising Russian-speaking victims with custom malware since 2012. Their campaigns continue to evolve but remain highly focused.
