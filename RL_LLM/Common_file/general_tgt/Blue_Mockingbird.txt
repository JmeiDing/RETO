The document describes a threat actor called Blue Mockingbird that has been deploying Monero cryptocurrency mining malware on Windows machines across multiple organizations. Blue Mockingbird gains initial access by exploiting the CVE-2019-18935 vulnerability in Telerik UI web applications. The attacker leverages the privileges of a DCOM class and IIS Application Pool Identity's SeImpersonate privilege to perform the escalation. Once in, they use various techniques like process injection, DLL sideloading, and privilege escalation to deploy and persist a malicious Monero miner built on XMRig. The miner payload communicates with external mining pools to mine Monero. Blue Mockingbird uses lateral movement techniques like RDP and Windows admin shares to distribute the payload across the network. Blue Mockingbird appears to experiment with different tools, such as Fast Reverse Proxy (frp), Secure Socket Funneling (SSF), and Venom, to pivot between systems. They have also experimented with different reverse shell and proxy tools for command and control. Persistence mechanisms involve hijacking services like wercplsupport using COR_PROFILER COM hijacking. The malware compiles each payload with a list of commonly used Monero-mining domains and a wallet address, which can be extracted from the binary or observed in network traffic. Red Canary provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, Monero wallet addresses, and analytics to detect the miner payloads, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. They also advise patching public-facing apps and establishing a baseline of normal scheduled tasks. In summary, the document analyzes a sophisticated, evolving threat actor distributing stealthy cryptocurrency miners using multiple intrusion techniques across victim networks.
