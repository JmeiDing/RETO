The cybersecurity firm Cybereason uncovered a new espionage campaign targeting Israeli government and defense officials. The campaign is attributed with moderate-high confidence to the threat actor APT-C-23, which is believed to operate on behalf of Hamas. The group has upgraded its malware arsenal with new tools like BarbWire Backdoor and Barb(ie) Downloader, which are stealthy and designed for operational security. The attackers used fake Facebook profiles of attractive women to connect with male Israeli targets. After building trust, they directed the targets to malware disguised as encrypted chat apps for Android and Windows. The Windows malware consists of two components - Barb(ie) Downloader and BarbWire Backdoor. Barb(ie) profiles the victim's system and downloads BarbWire, which has extensive spying capabilities like keylogging, audio recording, and screenshot capture. The Android spyware is a new version of VolatileVenom, which can exfiltrate SMS messages, contacts, photos, calls logs, and other sensitive data. It communicates with a C2 server whose domain is encoded within a .so library file. This campaign shows APT-C-23 has enhanced its tools and techniques. The malware uses advanced stealth features and the infrastructure is kept segregated from past operations. While APT-C-23 previously targeted Palestinians, this campaign specifically focuses on Israelis. The report concludes that APT-C-23 has increased its capabilities and operational security. Its effectiveness at compromising Israeli targets through social engineering and custom malware demonstrates this is a sophisticated, politically motivated threat actor.
