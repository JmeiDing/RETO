The document describes analysis by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 on a new remote access trojan (RAT) called PingPull used by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as GALLIUM. GALLIUM is a likely Chinese state-sponsored group that has targeted telecommunications companies in Southeast Asia, Europe, and Africa. Recently, GALLIUM has expanded targeting to also include financial and government entities across 9 countries. PingPull is a new malware tool used by GALLIUM for espionage activities. It can communicate over ICMP, HTTPS, or raw TCP to avoid detection. PingPull disguises itself as a legitimate Windows service and mimics common system binaries. It can run commands, access shells, and exfiltrate data. Palo Alto Networks has identified over 170 IP addresses associated with GALLIUM infrastructure dating back to late 2020. Defensive measures are recommended. Protections for PingPull are available in Palo Alto Networks products like Cortex XDR, WildFire, and Threat Prevention. Indicators of compromise are provided. Further cooperation with government partners has been undertaken to track GALLIUM. Additional research is encouraged to uncover more details about this APT group and new malware.
