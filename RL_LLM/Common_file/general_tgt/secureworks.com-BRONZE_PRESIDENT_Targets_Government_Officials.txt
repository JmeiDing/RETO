The PDF describes research from Secureworks on a cyberespionage campaign targeting government officials in Europe, the Middle East, and South America. The threat actor uses Windows shortcut files contained in RAR archives that execute PlugX malware when opened. PlugX is a modular malware that can download additional plugins to enhance its capabilities beyond basic information gathering. The malware is embedded within RAR archive files and drops a decoy document to the logged-on user's %Temp% directory when executed. Analysis of the malware attributes the campaign to BRONZE PRESIDENT, a Chinese state-sponsored group. Tactics align with previous BRONZE PRESIDENT activity, including decoy documents about political issues, file paths, shellcode obfuscation, and PlugX modules. The malware achieves persistence using Run registry keys and credential theft for lateral movement. Network traffic goes to command and control servers hosted on infrastructure previously linked to BRONZE PRESIDENT. The decoy documents suggest the group is gathering intelligence on China's interests in the targeted regions. The malware evolves over time and BRONZE PRESIDENT continuously pivots to new targets for fresh intelligence requirements. The payload copies three files to a ProgramData subdirectory using a naming scheme unique to previous BRONZE PRESIDENT campaigns. The report concludes that government entities, especially those related to China's geopolitical interests, should closely monitor BRONZE PRESIDENT. Protection requires proactive threat hunting, restricting access to indicators of compromise, and updating defenses against PlugX malware.
