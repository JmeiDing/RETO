The document analyzes a new variant of the Turla APT group's KopiLuwak JavaScript backdoor being spread via a .NET dropper. The dropper was found on a malware repository and delivered the backdoor along with a G20-themed decoy document. This suggests targets may be involved in the G20 Digital Economy Task Force. The MSIL dropper drops and executes the Stage1 JS dropper and a PDF decoy. The JS dropper sets persistence, fingerprints the system, and installs the JS backdoor decryptor. The backdoor uses RC4 encryption and communicates with two compromised websites. It can exfiltrate data, download files, and execute arbitrary commands from the attacker. Changes from older versions include additional system fingerprinting, hardcoded network communication values, and a new command for downloading files. While the full scope of attacks leveraging this variant is unknown, its continual evolution highlights Turla's capabilities and efforts to refine their tools against high-value diplomatic and government targets.
