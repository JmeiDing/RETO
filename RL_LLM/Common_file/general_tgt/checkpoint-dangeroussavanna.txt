The document analyzes a cyberespionage campaign called DangerousSavanna that has been actively targeting financial institutions in French-speaking African countries since 2020. The campaign involves multiple variations of malware, including AMSI bypass techniques and a backdoor responsible for communication with the C&C server. The attackers use SysInternals Process Explorer driver to kill protected anti-malware processes. The threat actors use spearphishing emails containing malicious document attachments to infect victims. The documents contain macros, external templates, or lure users to download additional stages. A wide variety of infection chains are observed. Initial payloads like PoshC2, AsyncRAT, and Metasploit tools are retrieved, which then download additional reconnaissance and lateral movement tools. Techniques like process injection, scheduled tasks, and WMI are used for persistence and evasion. Open source tools like CrackMapExec, Backstab anti-EDR, and a keylogger are installed for further access and data theft. The actors interact heavily with victims via tools like PoshC2 and DWService remote access. Infrastructure shifts over time from third party sites to dedicated servers, registrars, and lookalike domains impersonating financial organizations. Latest activity shows the campaign is still very active. The targets are employees of major financial services groups and banks across countries like Ivory Coast, Morocco, Senegal, and Cameroon. The ultimate motivation appears to be financial theft and fraud. In summary, the report provides a comprehensive profile of the DangerousSavanna campaign - its tactics, infrastructure, malware tools, targeting, and ongoing evolution over 2020-2022. The threat actors display persistence and adaptivity.
