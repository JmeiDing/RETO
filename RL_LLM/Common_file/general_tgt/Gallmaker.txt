The document describes a new cyberespionage group called Gallmaker that has been active since at least December 2017. Gallmaker is targeting government, military, and defense organizations in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Gallmaker uses "living off the land" tactics rather than custom malware. They deliver malicious Office documents via spearphishing to gain initial access. The documents exploit the DDE protocol in Office to execute commands remotely on the victim's system. Once inside the system, Gallmaker uses publicly available tools like WindowsRoamingToolsTask, Metasploit payloads, WinZip, and the Rex Powershell library. They use these to execute commands, set up reverse shells, archive data likely for exfiltration, and manipulate Powershell scripts. Gallmaker deletes tools after use to cover their tracks. They use 3 primary IP addresses for command and control infrastructure. The targets include embassies of an Eastern European country globally, a Middle Eastern defense contractor, and a military organization. The targeting indicates this is likely a nation-state sponsored cyberspying campaign. Symantec discovered Gallmaker using their Targeted Attack Analytics technology which uses AI to detect suspicious activity like the specific Powershell commands used by Gallmaker. This allowed them to identify the campaign which may have otherwise stayed undetected due to the use of common tools. Symantec has put protections in place to defend against Gallmaker and provides IOCs and Yara rules to detect their activity. The report concludes by emphasizing the importance of advanced threat detection to identify sophisticated threats like Gallmaker.
