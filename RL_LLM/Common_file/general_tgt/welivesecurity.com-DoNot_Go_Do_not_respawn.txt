The PDF describes research by ESET on the threat actor group Donot Team (also known as APT-C-35 and SectorE02). Donot Team has been conducting cyberespionage campaigns since at least 2016, targeting organizations and individuals in South Asia, including government, military, and foreign affairs entities. Donot Team uses spearphishing emails with malicious Office document attachments to distribute malware from their signature "yty" malware framework. This modular framework consists of downloaders, backdoors, data exfiltration tools, and modules to collect files, take screenshots, log keystrokes, and more. Donot Team frequently updates their tactics, servers, filenames, and staging folders across campaigns. ESET analyzed two recent malware variants used in campaigns named DarkMusical and Gedit. DarkMusical targeted military entities in Bangladesh and Nepal, using macro documents and a chain of downloaders leading to lightweight backdoors and data theft. Gedit targeted Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka with weaponized documents exploiting CVE-2017-11882 and modular components in Go and C++. Within the Gedit campaigns, one specific wave called Henos in early 2021 was highlighted, showing minor modifications to the malware components. In total, Donot Team conducted consistent waves of attacks on the same targets around every 2-4 months over more than a year. The group is expected to continue evolutions in their malware and cyberespionage activities going forward.
