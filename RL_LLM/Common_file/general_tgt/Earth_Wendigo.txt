Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF document: The document describes a new threat actor named Earth Wendigo that has been conducting cyberattacks since May 2019 against organizations in Taiwan, including government, research institutions, and universities. The attacks involve sending spear phishing emails with malicious JavaScript to initial access and propagate. The JavaScript exploits steal credentials, inject persistent malware, and exfiltrate emails from the target's webmail system. Techniques include appending JavaScript to email signatures to infect contacts, exploiting an XSS vulnerability to inject malware into webmail pages, and using Service Worker scripts to intercept credentials and data. Once persistent access is gained, Earth Wendigo establishes a WebSocket connection to exfiltrate emails from the mailbox using a JavaScript backdoor. Email content and attachments are sent to the attacker's server. Additional malware variants used include Python-based backdoors, shellcode loaders, and Cobalt Strike. The domain used for command and control in the webmail attacks is also used with these malware samples. The report concludes that typical but also atypical techniques are used by this new threat actor to infiltrate organizations and steal sensitive data from webmail accounts. Indicators of compromise are provided.
