The PDF analyzes an APT attack exploiting a 0-day vulnerability CVE-2018-8174 in VBScript engine. The attack was detected in April 2018 by 360 Core Security targeting organizations in China. The vulnerability is a remote code execution flaw that can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code through malicious VBScript embedded in Office documents or websites. 360 Core Security reported the flaw to Microsoft which released a patch in May 2018. The initial infection vector is Office documents with malicious OLE objects linking to websites hosting the IE exploit. The exploit executes shellcode to retrieve payloads from remote servers. The payloads include backdoors that use DLL sideloading, hijacking, etc to evade detection. The payloads communicate with command and control servers to receive further instructions. The attack utilizes Powershell scripts, batch files, etc. to maintain persistence and cleanup traces. The hackers also use various obfuscation techniques to evade analysis. The decryption algorithm and PDB paths link this attack to a Chinese APT group called APT-C-06 by 360 Core Security. The group has been active since 2007 in cyber espionage activities. The victims seem to be mainly government, research, and trade organizations in China. The attackers seem to have access to 0-day exploits and can modify their arsenal rapidly. 360 Core Security coordinated with Microsoft for patching this exploit used in the wild.
