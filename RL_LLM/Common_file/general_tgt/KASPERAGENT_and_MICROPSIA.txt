The document describes targeted cyberattacks in the Middle East using two new Microsoft Windows malware families named KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA. The malware has been used in attacks since at least July 2015, primarily targeting users in the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories, and Egypt. KASPERAGENT is basic reconnaissance malware that establishes persistence on infected machines and acts as a downloader for further payloads. Some versions have extended capabilities like password stealing, screenshots, and exfiltration. The malware communicates with command and control servers like mailsinfo[.]net. MICROPSIA is written in Delphi and has extensive spying capabilities including keylogging, screenshotting, and document exfiltration. It uses encryption and other tactics to hide its C2 communications. The malware is linked to domains registered with the email adam.swift.2016@gmail.com. The attackers distributed the malware via spear phishing using shortened URLs and fake news websites. The phishing messages often contain politically-themed decoy documents of interest to targets in the region. Threat intelligence reveals links between the Windows malware and two new Android malware families called SECUREUPDATE and VAMP. They use similar infrastructure and targeting. In summary, the report provides extensive technical details on the KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA malware families used in targeted attacks in the Middle East. It explores the distribution methods, capabilities, infrastructure, and potential targets of the malware campaign.
