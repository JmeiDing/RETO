The PDF describes research by ESET on a cyberespionage umbrella group they call TA410. ESET believes TA410 consists of 3 teams with different tools and targets: - FlowingFrog uses Royal Road documents, Tendyron malware, and FlowCloud backdoor. They target universities, governments, and companies. - LookingFrog uses X4 and LookBack malware. They hit diplomatic organizations, governments, and companies globally. - JollyFrog uses off-the-shelf malware like PlugX. They target education, military, churches, and diplomacy. TA410 compromises targets by exploiting public-facing apps like Exchange or sending spearphishing. Once inside, they use malware like FlowCloud, which has extensive spying capabilities and advanced evasion techniques. FlowCloud can record audio, take pictures, log keystrokes, steal clipboard data, and more. It uses rootkits, encryption, and sandbox evasion to hide. LookBack uses a custom protocol with encryption and obfuscation to communicate. It can proxy commands and exfiltrate data. ESET notes overlaps in tactics, infrastructure, and targets between the subgroups. But they use different tools, indicating independent teams sharing some resources. TA410 continues actively compromising high-value targets globally. ESET's research reveals the inner workings of this sophisticated threat actor group. Their tools and malware show the capabilities of Chinese state-sponsored espionage.
