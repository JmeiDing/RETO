The report provides an overview of the cybercriminal group Winnti's operations from December 2020 to April 2021. Winnti, tracked by NTT as Entity-1, actively targets organizations across Asia, especially media, travel, government, and telecom entities in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Australia, and more. Winnti operates daily during Asian working hours, exploiting servers and leveraging tools like the Acunitex scanner and Cobalt Strike. Compromised Glassfish servers are used as disposable command and control infrastructure. Custom malware like the Fishmaster stager are seen along with backdoors Shadowpad, Spyder, and Winnti. Acunitex scanning focuses on Winnti's areas of interest like media in Hong Kong and government infrastructure in Australia. Cobalt Strike traffic uses typosquatting and spoofed certificates to mimic legitimate sites. Analysis of payloads and infrastructure reveals targeting of Taiwanese companies. Winnti continuously re-uses reported domains and IP addresses for activities. The report concludes Winnti seems to be a well-resourced, persistent advanced persistent threat group constantly expanding their capabilities. Defenders should monitor Winnti TTPs and IOCs to detect activity in their networks.
