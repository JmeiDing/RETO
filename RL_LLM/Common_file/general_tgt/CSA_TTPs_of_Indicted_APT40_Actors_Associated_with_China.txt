The document is a joint cybersecurity advisory issued by the FBI and CISA about a Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as APT40. The goal is to provide information on APT40's tactics, techniques, and procedures as well as indicators of compromise to help organizations detect and mitigate APT40 intrusions. APT40 is located in Hainan, China and has been active since at least 2009. They have targeted a wide range of industries and organizations in the US, Canada, Europe, Middle East, and South China Sea region. Recently, four APT40 members were indicted by the US Department of Justice for computer network exploitation activities conducted through their front company Hainan Xiandun Technology Development Co. APT40 uses spearphishing emails with malicious attachments or links as an initial access vector. Once inside a network, they rely on a variety of custom and open-source tools to establish persistence, escalate privileges, move laterally, and exfiltrate data. Some of their notable malware includes BADFLICK, China Chopper, Cobalt Strike, Gh0stRAT, and NanHaiShu. For command and control, APT40 often uses domain typosquatting to impersonate legitimate domains. They use multiple hops and protocols like Tor to hide their activities. Data is archived, encrypted, and exfiltrated over the C&C channel. Defenses focus on proper patch management, multi-factor authentication, monitoring for suspicious access attempts, network segmentation, and use of threat intelligence feeds. A list of over 300 APT40 associated IOCs is provided covering domains, file hashes, and more. In summary, the advisory provides a comprehensive profile of APT40's tactics, infrastructure, malware, and mitigation strategies to help organizations improve detection and response capabilities against this advanced threat actor.
