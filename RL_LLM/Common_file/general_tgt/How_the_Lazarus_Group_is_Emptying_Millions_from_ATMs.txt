The PDF describes an ATM hacking operation called "FASTCash" conducted by a hacking group called Lazarus Group (also known as Hidden Cobra). The operation has been ongoing since at least 2016 and has stolen tens of millions of dollars by making fraudulent cash withdrawals from ATMs around the world. The Lazarus Group first breaches the networks of financial institutions and compromises the servers that process ATM transactions. They install malware named Trojan.Fastcash which monitors transaction requests and generates fake responses approving fraudulent cash withdrawals. The hackers use real bank accounts with minimal activity to initiate the fraudulent transactions. It's unclear how they gain control of these accounts. The malware variants are tailored for specific transaction processing networks. They contain logic to construct fake ISO 8583 financial transaction messages approving the fraudulent withdrawals. The attacks have compromised unsupported AIX servers at banks beyond their service pack support dates. The Lazarus Group is a sophisticated and active threat actor involved in both cybercrime and espionage. They are known for major attacks like the hack of Sony Pictures in 2014 and the $81 million Bangladesh bank heist in 2016. They were also linked to the WannaCry ransomware outbreak. The FASTCash attacks demonstrate the group's deep knowledge of banking systems and focus on financially-motivated cybercrime. Banks worldwide remain at serious risk of attack and need to ensure their systems are fully updated and secured.
