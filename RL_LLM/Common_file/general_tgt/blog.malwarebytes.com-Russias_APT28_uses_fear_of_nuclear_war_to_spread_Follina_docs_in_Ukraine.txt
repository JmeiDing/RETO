The document describes a recent phishing campaign conducted by APT28, a Russian state-sponsored threat actor, targeting victims in Ukraine. APT28 leveraged the Follina exploit in weaponized Word documents pretending to discuss fears over potential nuclear escalation in the Russia-Ukraine war. When opened, the document uses the exploit to execute a .NET-based credential stealer designed to harvest passwords and cookies from major web browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. The lure document discusses the chances of Putin utilizing nuclear weapons in the conflict. If opened, it retrieves and executes a remote HTML file that loads the stealer payload using PowerShell commands. The stealer exfiltrates the stolen browser data using IMAP to a command and control server. While a basic attack, it provides APT28 access to harvest sensitive credentials and enable further access aligned with Russian intelligence interests. The campaign demonstrates APT28 opportunistically using the Ukraine war and nuclear attack fears as lures. It also shows the group rapidly incorporating an exploit for Follina, a Windows zero-day publicly revealed in early June 2022. The targeting of Ukraine with spyware and email lures illustrates ongoing cyber espionage supporting Russia's overall war efforts.
