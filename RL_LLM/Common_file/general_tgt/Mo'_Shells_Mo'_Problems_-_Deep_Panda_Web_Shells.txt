The document describes web shells used by a Chinese threat actor group called Deep Panda to maintain persistent access to compromised networks. Web shells are scripts that provide backdoor access when hosted on a web server. The PDF analyzes two ASP web shells used by Deep Panda - a 28 byte shell called Showimg.asp and a more advanced 45KB shell called System_web.aspx. Showimg.asp allows arbitrary command execution through encoded requests. System_web.aspx has robust functionality like file operations, database access, command execution, and compiling code. Deep Panda uses web shells as primary backdoors instead of traditional malware because web shells are stealthy, have no command and control traffic, and bypass antivirus. The web shells use authentication and restrictive access to avoid detection. The analysis aims to help organizations identify these web shells by understanding their capabilities. Future posts will detail detection approaches like file stacking analysis, web log review, and network detection. The series culminates in a case study of an incident response investigation that discovered the web shells. In summary, the document provides an in-depth look at stealthy web shells used by Deep Panda for persistent access, in order to help organizations improve detection, monitoring, and incident response against this threat.
