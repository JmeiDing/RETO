The PDF describes a new cyberespionage malware framework called Ramsay that is designed to operate in air-gapped networks and exfiltrate sensitive documents. Ramsay was discovered by ESET researchers, with the earliest sample found uploaded from Japan. Ramsay has been under development since late 2019 and has multiple versions tailored for different targets. It uses various attack vectors like weaponized Office documents exploiting vulnerabilities and trojanized apps. Once executed, it establishes persistence using techniques like hijacking DLLs loaded by services. The main capability of Ramsay is covert collection of Word documents from local and removable drives which are encrypted and hidden inside normal .doc files for later exfiltration. It has a custom command and control protocol where it looks for special control files on removable media to execute commands. Ramsay also has a spreading component that infects EXE files on removable drives to propagate further. It can scan for hosts vulnerable to EternalBlue on the local network. Some code similarities were found between Ramsay and the Retro malware linked to the DarkHotel APT group, including reuse of specific tokens. DarkHotel is known for targeting government entities in Asia. Currently Ramsay has low victim visibility, likely because it is still in development and focused on air-gapped networks. ESET researchers will continue monitoring for new activity from this framework.
