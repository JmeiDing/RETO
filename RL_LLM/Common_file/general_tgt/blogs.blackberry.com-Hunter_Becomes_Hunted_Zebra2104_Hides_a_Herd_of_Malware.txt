The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team uncovered connections between three distinct threat groups - MountLocker ransomware operators, Phobos ransomware operators, and the StrongPity APT group. Through investigation of the domain trashborting[.]com serving Cobalt Strike beacons, the researchers found links to spam infrastructure used to distribute various malware including Dridex and ransomware. Further analysis revealed that the MountLocker and Phobos ransomware groups deployed their malware using the same infrastructure, suggesting an initial access broker named Zebra2104 was providing access to victim networks. Zebra2104 appears to gain initial access through exploitation or phishing, then sells that access on underground forums to the highest bidder such as ransomware affiliates. The infrastructure analysis also connected the StrongPity APT group to the same hosting IPs, indicating they may have purchased access from Zebra2104 as well. While the motives of ransomware operators and APT groups don't typically align, this research revealed apparent cooperation facilitated by an initial access broker. The researchers conclude that cybercrime groups are increasingly forming partnerships and alliances like multinational organizations, so the security community should share intelligence to better monitor and defend against them.
