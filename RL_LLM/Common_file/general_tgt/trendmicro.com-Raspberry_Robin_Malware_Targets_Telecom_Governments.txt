The PDF describes research by Trend Micro on a new malware called Raspberry Robin that has been targeting telecommunications and government systems since September 2022. The malware spreads via infected USB drives containing LNK files that execute commands to download the malware's main component. The main component uses extensive packing and code obfuscation across over 10 layers to evade security tools. If sandboxing is detected, Raspberry Robin loads a fake payload that gathers system info. The real payload connects to the Tor network and contains a custom Tor client. The purpose of the real payload is still being analyzed. Raspberry Robin uses sophisticated techniques like abusing Session 0 isolation and elevated COM objects to gain privileges and persist on systems. It shares some techniques with LockBit ransomware, but the exact relationship is unconfirmed. The malware appears to be in reconnaissance stages, spreading globally but not yet delivering a definitive payload. Trend Micro believes this shows the threat actor's long-term plans and capabilities, and expects follow-up operations in the future. In summary, the PDF provides an in-depth analysis of the obfuscation, anti-analysis, installation, and communication capabilities of the Raspberry Robin malware, which is currently targeting government and telecom entities worldwide.
