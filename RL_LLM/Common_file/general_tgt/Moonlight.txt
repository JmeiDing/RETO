The document describes targeted cyberattacks against entities in the Middle East by a group referred to as "Moonlight." The attacks appear politically motivated for espionage rather than financial gain. The attacks target victims in the Middle East, primarily connecting from home networks. One notable victim is a Palestinian news organization. The attackers use social engineering tactics, sending emails with attachments or links that have .exe extensions disguised as legitimate files. The decoy documents have themes relevant to Middle Eastern politics. The attackers use the H-Worm malware as a first stage backdoor, delivering it via shortened URLs and domains impersonating Middle Eastern media groups. Later stages install the Remote Access Trojan (RAT) njRat to maintain persistence. The malware samples show evidence of manual creation rather than automated build processes. The command and control infrastructure consists of dynamic domains controlled via home internet connections in the West Bank of Palestine. Over 200 varied malware samples were identified. Earlier attacks were more opportunistic, but later attacks specifically targeted groups and individuals. The tools and targets indicate a possible connection to the Gaza Hacker Team. The attacks demonstrate that zero-days and exploits are not required for successful compromises. Instead, the group relies on basic scripts and obfuscation of known malware. The security implications are significant given the political motivations, even if the technical sophistication is low. The attacks could enable espionage and loss of life between rival factions.
