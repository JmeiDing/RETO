The report details an ongoing campaign by the threat actor group Bitter, also known as T-APT-17, targeting Bangladesh. Bitter is a threat group that uses malicious document files as lures to download additional malware stages, including Keyloggers, Stealers, and Remote Access Trojans (RATs). The initial documents drop a downloader malware called ZxxZ or MuuyDownloader which fingerprints the system and retrieves a final payload, often a RAT. The second stage of a Bitter attack typically consists of a Loader, which gathers information about the infected system and retrieves the third stage from a remote server. The third stage of a Bitter attack can feature different types of Malware, such as Keyloggers, Stealers, or Remote Access Trojans (RATs). One example of a newer utilized RAT is "Almond RAT." The malware has evolved over time but follows asimilar multi-stage process. Host Sailor and Namecheap are hosting servers for the Downloader and C2 servers, respectively, while Nexeon Technologies hosts the Almond RAT C2 server. The report analyzes a .NET RAT dubbed Almond RAT that has capabilities for command execution, file exfiltration, screenshots, etc. It communicates over port 33638. Infrastructure analysis traces the campaign to various web hosting providers used for staging malware. Defender recommendations include patching Office apps, network monitoring for IOCs, and other detection and prevention controls. Continued analysis of Bitter's evolving tactics is warranted as the group remains active in Asia.
