The PDF describes research by Kaspersky on the activities of an advanced persistent threat (APT) group they attribute to APT10. The group uses a sophisticated malware called LODEINFO to target organizations in Japan, particularly media, government, diplomatic, and public sector entities. LODEINFO is a sophisticated fileless malware developed by the developers. The report provides an analysis of new infection methods observed in 2022, including the use of malicious Microsoft Word documents, self-extracting archives containing DLL sideloading, and a new downloader called DOWNIISSA. The Word documents trick users into enabling macros that drop malware. The self-extracting archives pretend to be videos but drop malware using DLL sideloading when opened. DOWNIISSA is embedded in Word docs and downloads the LODEINFO backdoor. Multiple versions of LODEINFO were observed, showing the malware is continuously updated to evade detection. The decoy documents used Japanese text and filenames referring to Japanese politicians, indicating the targeting is focused on Japan. The report concludes that the attackers are tracking research publications to update their tactics, techniques, and procedures. Additional analysis on the LODEINFO backdoor itself will be provided in a follow-up report.
