The document provides an analysis of the July 2011 cyberattack against South Korean company SK Communications, in which personal information of up to 35 million users was stolen from the CyWorld and Nate online services. The hackers exploited a trojaned software update from a compromised South Korean software company's server to infect over 60 SK Communications computers. They used the infected computers between July 18-25 to collect credentials and access information to prepare for accessing the user databases. On July 26, using a Remote Administration Tool (RAT) malware called "nateon.exe", callback domains like "nateon.duamlive.com", and waypoint servers, the hackers accessed and stole personal information of millions of users from the Nate and CyWorld databases. The stolen information included names, contact info, birthdays, passwords etc. The report provides technical details on how the trojaned update and RAT malware worked, including code analysis. It highlights the commands, protocols, domain names, IP addresses, and other infrastructure used by the hackers. The hackers appear to be part of an advanced persistent threat (APT) group that conducted long-term planning and used sophisticated techniques. The report analyzes their tactics, techniques, and procedures, and aims to provide valuable insights to help network defenders protect against such attacks.
