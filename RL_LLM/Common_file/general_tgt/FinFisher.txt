The Citizen Lab research group conducted an internet scan searching for command and control servers associated with FinFisher surveillance software sold by Gamma Group. They found servers in 25 countries, indicating the global proliferation of this powerful spyware tool. FinFisher tools like FinSpy are marketed for lawful interception and monitoring criminals, but have been used to target opposition groups and human rights activists in repressive regimes. The report details finding a FinSpy campaign in Ethiopia using images of an opposition group as bait, and a sample of FinSpy Mobile (for Android) in Vietnam sending data to a local phone number. Despite Gamma Group's claims that previously discovered servers were not part of their product line, the continuing discovery of FinFisher tools and command servers in more countries contradicts their statements. The similarities between samples also bring into question claims that previous copies were stolen demonstration versions. The report warns of the human rights ramifications and risk to cybersecurity from the unregulated market for offensive cyber capabilities. It calls for more scrutiny and policy debate regarding the commercialization of surveillance and intrusion software. The global spread of tools like FinFisher highlights the need for vigilance in improving cybersecurity and protecting activists internationally.
