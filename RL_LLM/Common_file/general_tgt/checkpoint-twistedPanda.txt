The document details research by Check Point on a Chinese APT group named Twisted Panda that is conducting cyber espionage against Russian defense institutes. The targets are part of the Rostec state defense conglomerate and focus on electronics, radar, and avionics R&D. The attacks rely on spear phishing emails using sanctions-related lures. The attachments contain macros that download a multi-stage malware infection chain. This includes a new loader called Nimbda written in the Nim language and a backdoor named SPINNER. The payload uses two compiler-level obfuscations: Control flow flattening and Opaque predicates. SPINNER uses advanced evasion techniques like compiler-level obfuscations. The full version of the SPINNER backdoor contains several capabilities, such as collecting information about the infected machine, exfiltrating files, running OS commands, and executing downloaded payload. It is a stripped down version of a full backdoor used in previous campaigns going back to June 2021. The full backdoor has extensive capabilities for collection, exfiltration, and further payloads. The EXE dropper functionality is split between a malicious document and the loader, while the DLL loader adds more functionality to handle different call reasons in DllMain. The campaign infrastructure uses hosting in China. The tactics overlap with other Chinese groups like APT10 and Mustang Panda. The targeting of Russian defense and technology is consistent with China's strategic interests. In summary, this reveals a sophisticated cyber espionage operation by a Chinese APT nicknamed Twisted Panda targeting Russian state defense research, using new custom tools, to likely collect intelligence and technological information.
