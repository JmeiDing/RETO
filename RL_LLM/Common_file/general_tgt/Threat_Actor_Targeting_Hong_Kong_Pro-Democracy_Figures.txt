The PDF describes targeted attacks by an unnamed threat actor against Hong Kong pro-democracy figures in late 2019. The attacks started with spear phishing emails containing Google Drive links to weaponized ZIP archives. The archives contained benign documents related to Hong Kong as lures, along with a LNK shortcut that remotely downloaded and executed malware. The malware was a Python-based backdoor that used the Dropbox API as a C2 channel. It collected system info, installed an autorun registry key for persistence, and could receive encrypted commands from the C2 server to execute on the victim machine. At least one pro-democracy target and one other victim in Hong Kong were infected. The attacker exfiltrated personal documents from the second victim related to travel and business. The threat actor also staged additional payloads on the C2 server including signed Microsoft utilities that were vulnerable to DLL sideloading attacks. This indicates they intended to escalate privileges and compromise further. The report concludes the attackers likely aimed to monitor people related to the Hong Kong protests, in order to understand the pro-democracy movement. The use of legitimate services like GitHub and Dropbox helped them bypass network defenses. Overall, the PDF provides a case study of how this particular threat actor leveraged spear phishing, living off the land binaries, and cloud services to infiltrate their targets and exfiltrate sensitive data related to the Hong Kong protests.
