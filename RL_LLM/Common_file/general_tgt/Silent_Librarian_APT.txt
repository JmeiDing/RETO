The document discusses phishing campaigns conducted by an Iranian advanced persistent threat (APT) group called Silent Librarian, also known as TA407 or COBALT DICKENS. Silent Librarian has been actively targeting universities with spear phishing attacks since September 2020, as schools reopened for the new academic year. The group registers lookalike domains that mimic real university sites and uses them for phishing login pages to steal credentials. Examples include library.adelaide.crev.me, blackboard.stonybrook.ernn.me, and others targeting over a dozen universities worldwide. The phishing sites are hosted on servers in Iran and use Cloudflare to obfuscate their origin. The group has built a large infrastructure to continue successful phishing despite takedowns. The phishing emails aim to get users to enter credentials on the fake sites, which are then compromised by the threat actors. Silent Librarian has been tied to the Iranian government and driven by national interests to steal academic research and data. The group follows the same pattern annually, targeting universities around the start of the school year. They have been active since at least 2018. The report provides indicators of compromise like domain names, IPs, and hostnames associated with the group's infrastructure. It aims to help security teams detect and stop these credential phishing attacks.
