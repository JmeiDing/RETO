The document is an analysis by Avast Threat Labs of an attack against the systems hosting the website and infrastructure for the 2021 National Games of China. The games took place in September 2021 in Shaanxi, China. The analysis found that attackers gained initial access on September 3 by likely exploiting vulnerabilities in the Lua scripts route.lua or index.lua on the website. They then uploaded various reverse shell scripts like runscript.lua, conf.lua, and admin2.php to maintain access. The attackers spent time figuring out what file types could be uploaded and testing different webshells. They tried to reconfigure the web server to better execute their malware but were unsuccessful. Ultimately, they uploaded a weaponized Tomcat server with the Rebeyond Behinder webshell. The attackers used a custom Chinese exploitation framework written in Go to scan the network and exploit vulnerabilities. The framework has different plugins for reconnaissance, attacking services, brute forcing passwords, and exploiting common web app vulnerabilities. An example of it exploiting a Python web server is shown. Avast concludes that keeping infrastructure patched and updated is critical. Webshells are hard to detect so additional protections like EDR solutions should be used. Monitoring networks for unusual activity can also detect lateral movement like what happened here. The use of Go for malware is notable and likely to continue given its portability.
