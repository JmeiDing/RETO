The document describes the activities of a Pakistan-based threat actor group called Gorgon Group that conducts both cybercrime and targeted attacks. The group used phishing emails containing weaponized Office documents to target government agencies, military personnel, and private companies in the US, UK, Spain, Russia, and Pakistan. The initial documents contained macros that downloaded a .NET trojan, which in turn downloaded a second stage injector and final payloads like remote access trojans such as NanoCoreRAT. The group used public malware builders and source code, and techniques like process hollowing, to evade detection. Several Gorgon Group members were identified including Subaat, Fudpages, and Wool3n.H4t based on operational security failures like open directories. The group used compromised servers and URL shorteners to host malware. Overlap was seen between infrastructure used in cybercrime and targeted attacks. During cybercrime campaigns, Gorgon Group distributed commodity trojans like LokiBot and AZORult via malspam. In targeted attacks, the group impersonated military officers and used lures about terrorism and politics. Payloads included QuasarRAT, NjRAT, and RemcosRAT. While technically unsophisticated, Gorgon Group successfully compromised high-value targets. The report provides IOCs and recommendations for detection and prevention of similar attacks using threat intelligence.
