In May 2022, the Japan Computer Emergency Response Team (JPCERT/CC) observed attacks against Japanese organizations exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2022-1388) in F5 BIG-IP devices. The attacks compromised data on the BIG-IP devices. JPCERT/CC believes the attacks are attributed to a threat actor group called BlackTech based on attack tools like TSCookie and Bifrose malware found on servers used in the attacks. The attacks used exploit code targeting the BIG-IP vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands. The code contained IP addresses of Japanese BIG-IP devices that were targeted. JPCERT/CC also discovered a new Linux malware called Hipid deployed in the attacks, with versions targeting ARM and x64 architectures. Hipid has command and control capabilities to receive commands and exfiltrate data. Some versions use RC4 encryption. JPCERT/CC found Hipid was also distributed through malicious PyPI packages, encoded in Base32 and disguising its process. The report emphasizes the importance of timely patching to mitigate attacks exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, as the BIG-IP exploit was used shortly after disclosure. It also provides indicators of compromise like C2 servers and malware hashes. The incidents appear contained now, but are an example of BlackTech exploiting internet-facing vulnerabilities for cyber espionage, now using a new Hipid malware variant.
