The PDF analyzes a campaign distributing the PlugX remote access trojan (RAT) to target telecom and military organizations in Russia and neighboring countries. The attacks have been attributed to a suspected Chinese threat actor known as TA459. The infection vectors are spearphishing emails containing either weaponized Office documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 or links to RAR archives hosting PlugX droppers. The lures use military themes and Russian language. PlugX is installed via DLL sideloading techniques, masquerading as a signed F-Secure component. It uses peer-to-peer communication for command and control. The malware provides backdoor access, keylogging, screenshots, etc. The infrastructure links PlugX to other RAT families like Saker, Netbot, and DarkStRat which were also used by this group in the past. The C2 domains point to hosting in Hong Kong registered under false identities. The attackers continuously adapt their tactics, leveraging publicly available information for social engineering and evolving malware delivery techniques. The campaign reveals an adversary focused on Russian military and telecom targets for espionage motives. Continuous monitoring and a layered security approach is needed to detect and respond to such targeted attacks that bypass traditional defenses through custom malware and evasion techniques.
