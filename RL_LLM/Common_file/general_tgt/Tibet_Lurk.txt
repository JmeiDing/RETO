The brief documents targeted malware attacks against Tibetan groups from May to July 2012 that used socially engineered emails to distribute the LURK remote access trojan. The emails contained malicious Office docs requiring a password provided in the message to open. Passwords reflected dates of significance to Tibetans. The social engineering became more advanced over time, eventually repurposing authentic confidential material of Tibetan groups. This suggests the attackers infiltrated Tibetan organizations to increase credibility. The LURK malware payload connected to the same command and control server in each attack. LURK is a variant of Gh0stRAT and part of a long-running cyberespionage campaign likely originating from China targeting the Tibetan community. Technical analysis revealed the malware's inner workings including encryption mechanisms, registry modifications, and network traffic patterns. Attacks used dynamic DNS domains and IP addresses linked to Chinese infrastructure. The brief highlights the growing sophistication of social engineering in targeted attacks against activist communities. It underscores the importance of vigilance around suspicious emails and safe computing practices to mitigate risk.
