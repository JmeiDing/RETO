The report details Emissary Panda's tactics, techniques, and procedures in exploiting the Microsoft Exchange ProxyLogon vulnerability to gain initial access and persist in a target's network to steal intellectual property. It outlines how Emissary Panda compromised an Exchange server on March 4, 2021, the same day public disclosure of ProxyLogon, and quickly moved laterally to infect other systems with their custom RAT malware HyperBro. The threat actor gained domain admin privileges, exfiltrated data, and maintained access for 7 months before attempting further data theft in October when they likely detected threat intelligence sharing about their infrastructure. The report analyzes HyperBro's sophisticated evasion techniques including process hollowing, side-loading benign DLLs, custom encryption, and masked C2 traffic. It also examines Emissary Panda's living off the land tactics using built-in Windows tools for discovery, credential access, and data collection. Detailed timelines, malware analysis, and extensive IOCs showcase Emissary Panda's tradecraft in utilizing critical vulnerabilities for targeted intrusion. The report highlights trends of advanced persistent threats groups opportunistically using vulnerabilities, while appearing as commodity malware to fly under the radar. Recommendations include adopting an intelligence-driven security strategy, readiness to rapidly detect and respond to new vulnerabilities, reducing dwell time, and thinking unconventionally to defend against sophisticated adversaries.
