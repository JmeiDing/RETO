The PDF analyzes a suite of remote access trojans called Ratsnif used by the OceanLotus cyberespionage group (also known as APT32). Ratsnif has been under development since 2016 and combines multiple network attack techniques. The main capabilities of Ratsnif include: - Packet sniffing to harvest credentials and sensitive data - ARP poisoning to intercept traffic intended for the default gateway - DNS spoofing to redirect domain requests - HTTP injection to insert arbitrary content into webpages - HTTP redirection to send users to attacker controlled sites Ratsnif typically relies on command and control servers for direction. But a 2018 variant uses a configuration file tailored to the victim's network instead. This version focuses on stealing credentials and adds new features like SSL decryption. Multiple Ratsnif samples over 2016-2018 are examined. The analysis shows the malware is under active development by OceanLotus actors to expand its network attack features. Ratsnif aims to gain access to sensitive data by manipulating and sniffing traffic on compromised networks. The PDF provides an in-depth look at an advanced piece of OceanLotus malware and its evolution over time to evade detection and expand its capabilities.
