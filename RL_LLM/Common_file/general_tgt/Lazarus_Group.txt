The document analyzes a 2019 campaign by the Lazarus cybercrime group targeting the cryptocurrency industry. Initial access relied on phishing to distribute weaponized Word documents containing macros. The macros executed a multi-stage infection chain using Powershell, mshta, and VB scripts to retrieve custom malware. The main implants were backdoors that collected system info, downloaded additional tools, and enabled remote control. The group used native utilities like Certutil, Mimikatz, and Netsh for lateral movement, credential theft, and modifying defenses. Operational security was a priority, with event log clearing and file deletion to remove traces. Attribution was based on shared code and techniques with prior Lazarus malware. The targeting of cryptocurrency fits their financial theft objectives, though the end goal may have been fund transfers. Defensive recommendations include detection rules for TTPs like registry changes, process injection, and use of obscuring utilities.
