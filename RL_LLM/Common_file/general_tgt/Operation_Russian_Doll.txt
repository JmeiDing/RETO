The report provides an in-depth analysis of malware associated with a Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) group called APT28. It examines a specific malware sample from an attack dubbed "Operation RussianDoll." It first provides static and dynamic analysis of the malware, identifying it as a multi-stage attack that escalates privileges by exploiting a vulnerability in the Windows kernel (CVE-2015-1701). The initial dropper is written in Delphi and downloads the upnphost payload, which gathers system info and communicates over HTTPS. The report then digs into the technical details of how the exploit works by abusing the win32k.sys driver. It hooks the Windows kernel callback table and overwrites the _ClientCopyImage pointer. When the creation of a window object calls xxxClientCopyImage, it executes the malware's code instead, which sets the window procedure to a kernel address and exploits the missing validation of the server-side window procedure flag. Next, the report explores how red teams could repurpose the exploit to build more advanced tools. It outlines the process of reproducing the key components in code and then adding capabilities like loading encrypted, unsigned drivers over the network. This could enable stealthy data collection even in environments with antivirus controls. The report concludes by summarizing how defenders can analyze exploits through static and dynamic techniques. It also highlights the urgency of prompt patching and the importance of controls like virtualization and whole-system analysis to detect advanced kernel-mode threats.
