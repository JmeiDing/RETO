The cybersecurity company Cluster25 analyzed a phishing campaign targeting the Russian diplomatic sector attributed to the North Korean state-sponsored hacking group Konni. The attack used a malicious zip file attached to emails as bait, pretending to be a holiday screensaver from the Russian embassy. When executed, it installed a multi-stage malware payload culminating in a new version of the Konni remote access trojan (RAT) being installed as a service for persistence and data exfiltration. The initial zip file dropper displayed a Russian holiday-themed image to distract the user while it downloaded the next stage payload from a command and control server. This payload extracted a batch script that waited for files to decompress before launching the Konni RAT installer. The installer moved the RAT files into System32, registered the RAT as a service, and configured it to load at startup. The Konni RAT gathered system information, cached web browsing history, running processes, and user/owner details before archiving and encrypting the data to exfiltrate to the C2 server. It could also receive additional commands from the C2. Cluster25 analyzed the code and behaviors which aligned with this APT group's previous tactics, techniques and procedures, though some modifications like the initial email vector were noted. Infrastructure analysis found overlaps with domains and hosting providers commonly used by the larger North Korean cyber threat ecosystem called Kimsuky. The report contains indicators of compromise and MITRE ATT&CK mappings of the attack lifecycle, reaffirming attribution to Konni with high confidence. It serves as an example of this group's ongoing digital espionage campaigns against foreign targets for the North Korean regime.
