Avast's CCleaner software was found to contain a backdoor, likely planted by the APT17 group. This is one of the most sophisticated cyber attacks ever conducted and they specialize in supply chain attacks. The backdoor in CCleaner shares code with earlier APT17 samples and has never been seen before in any other software. The malware injected into CCleaner collects data about the computer and contacts a C&C server to retrieve and execute code. The main module of the malware uses anti-debug techniques and a domain generation algorithm to avoid detection. Technical analysis shows how the malware decrypts and executes embedded code, loads a PE file, collects system data, contacts a C&C server, and executes commands sent by the C&C server.
