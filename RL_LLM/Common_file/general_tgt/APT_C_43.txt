According to the analysis of 360 Security Center, they discovered that the group named APT_C_43 began to attack Venezuelan military institutions in 2019. The group keeps monitoring and stealing the latest military secrets by hacking into different military institutions, deploying backdoors. They named the operation HpReact and believed that the political motivation behind it may be to help the reactionary forces led by Juan Gerardo Guaidó Márquez steal Venezuelan military secrets to provide intelligence support against the current government. The technology used by APT_C_43 has changed significantly in the past few years, and their network communication mainly relies on FTP and HTTP protocols. They used a malicious component named NisSrv.bat, which was downloaded via the FTP protocol, which contained variables named after many Spanish words, such as server (servidor), user name (usuario), password (contraseña), etc. The group also used a Windows installer called setupXOX.msi to deploy the final backdoor component via an MSI Wrapper. During the running process, the python environment and various dependent libraries need to be executed, which caused the size of setupXOX.msi to reach 8.10M. The malware installed the Pyark backdoor written in Python which collected documents, keystrokes, screenshots, camera images and microphone audio. It exfiltrated the data via FTP. Finally, the group deploys the aforementioned backdoor components by running svchost.exe and files in the msiwpper configuration file. Now, this laboratory has been renamed as 360 Baize Lab, and is mainly responsible for providing core security data for products such as 360 Security Guard and 360 First Aid Team, as well as stubborn Trojan horse detection and antivirus solutions.
