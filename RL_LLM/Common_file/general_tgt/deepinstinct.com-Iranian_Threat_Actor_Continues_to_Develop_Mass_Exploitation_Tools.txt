The document discusses activity by an Iranian threat actor named PHOSPHORUS that was detected attempting to compromise an Exchange server belonging to a US infrastructure company. Deep Instinct prevented 7 exploitation attempts by PHOSPHORUS. Analysis revealed new malware variants and techniques, including installing a fake root certificate and blending malicious traffic with legitimate domains. PHOSPHORUS deployed droppers like "user.exe" and "task_update.exe" to create accounts, enable RDP access, and download a tunneling tool called FRPC. A new version of "task_update.exe" installed a fake Microsoft certificate to later validate FRPC's invalid certificate chain. FRPC variants contacted attacker domains posing as legitimate companies like Microsoft and Symantec. This trickery blends malicious traffic with legitimate traffic to evade detection. FRPC versions in early 2022 introduced this domain blending technique. PHOSPHORUS has been active since at least June 2020, evolving their tools over time. The group continues to scan for and exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to vulnerable organizations globally. Deep Instinct prevented their latest attempts thanks to predictive capabilities. The report details indicators of compromise like file hashes, domains, and IP addresses linked to PHOSPHORUS to help defend against this persistent threat actor.
