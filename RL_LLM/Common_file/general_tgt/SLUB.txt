The security researchers at Trend Micro discovered a new version of a malware called SLUB that is being spread through targeted watering hole attacks. The previous version used GitHub for command and control, but this new version relies entirely on Slack for C2. The malware is distributed through websites that exploit either CVE-2018-8174 or the more recent CVE-2019-0752, which Trend Micro's ZDI discovered. After exploitation, a loader is downloaded that contains exploits for privilege escalation on the victim's system. The loader then downloads the main SLUB malware payload. The attackers create Slack workspaces for command and control. Each infected victim joins a workspace and has their own channel. The attackers post pinned messages in the channels with commands, and the malware parses the pinned messages to carry out actions like taking screenshots, listing files, etc. Trend Micro found two Slack workspaces associated with this attack campaign containing usernames with email addresses from encrypted email services. Timezone and location metadata suggests one attacker is likely located in North Korea. The malware authors can update the Slack API tokens dynamically through a hardcoded website. This new version shows the attackers' tradecraft is advancing to avoid detection, though Trend Micro notes the targets appear to still be specific individuals rather than widespread attacks. Overall, this discovery highlights how attackers are evolving their techniques, moving from traditional C2 servers to cloud platforms like GitHub and Slack. Trend Micro has blacklisted indicators of compromise like hashes and Slack workspace names to protect customers.
