The report by ClearSky Security provides an update on an cyberespionage campaign called Operation DustySky attributed to a threat actor in Gaza. The group continues to target organizations and individuals in Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Europe, and the US with weekly waves of spearphishing emails containing weaponized documents that install a custom malware called DustySky. The report reveals new details on the scope of targeting, lure documents, and infrastructure supporting the year-long campaign. It also exposes the identity of the threat actor behind DustySky as an individual named Mo'ayyad Ayesh based in Gaza. After publishing previous research that disrupted attacks, ClearSky was contacted by Mo'ayyad trying to learn what they knew about him. The report concludes that the unsophisticated nature of the malware and infrastructure points to Hamas as the likely group orchestrating DustySky attacks for intelligence gathering against foreign affairs, security firms, finance, and other sectors. However, attacks temporarily paused after public disclosure before restarting with evolved tactics. Recommendations for mitigation focus on employee security awareness training. In summary, the report provides updated insight into the ongoing DustySky campaign out of Gaza, revealing the threat actor's identity and analyzing the group's renewed targeting in the region after previous disclosure disrupted attacks.
