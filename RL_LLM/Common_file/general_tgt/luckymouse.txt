In March 2018, researchers detected an ongoing cyberespionage campaign targeting a national data center in Central Asia, active since late 2017. The threat actor is attributed to the Chinese-speaking group LuckyMouse (also called EmissaryPanda and APT27) based on tools and tactics used. The hackers used the HyperBro Trojan as the final in-memory remote access tool (RAT). Extensive use was made of the Metasploit encoder. The initial infection vector at the data center is unclear, but watering hole attacks were used to compromise government websites and inject scripts. The malware has multiple stages for anti-detection, using typical techniques like DLL side-loading. It ultimately injects HyperBro into svchost.exe memory. Compromised websites redirected victims to instances of ScanBox and Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) for exploitation. The campaign shows LuckyMouse's continued activity and targeting of government entities. Their tools are shared by multiple Chinese actors. Unusual tactics like compromising a Mikrotik router point to more sophisticated tradecraft. The attacks highlight risks of supply chain compromises through data centers.
