The PDF analyzes new malware used by the China Panda hacker group in attacks against the Vietnam Government Certification Authority (VGCA). In August 2020, trojanized VGCA software installers containing new malware were uncovered. The malware includes the files eToken.exe, RegistereToken.exe, and a DLL. Analysis shows the trojanized installer runs a custom action to execute eToken.exe, which contains the main malicious functionality. eToken.exe is built with Visual Studio 6 and MFC. It extracts and executes a DLL, creates scheduled tasks, installs as a service, and configures command and control servers. The DLL payload is a backdoor named smanager_ssl.dll that is implanted in the software supply chain. It is extracted from an embedded .cab file. Command and control IP addresses and domain names are hardcoded in the malware. A registry key is chosen randomly to install the service. The attack leverages the supply chain of VGCA software to target the government, agencies, organizations, and businesses in Vietnam that use the software. In summary, the report provides an in-depth analysis of the structure, functionality, and techniques of the new malware used in supply chain attacks against VGCA to target entities in Vietnam.
