The PDF discusses targeted email attacks against banks in the Middle East region observed by FireEye in early May 2016. The emails contained Excel docs with malicious macros that dropped scripts to gather system info and exfiltrate data via DNS. The macro code extracted base64 content from the Excel sheet and decoded it to drop a VBScript and PowerShell script. It created a scheduled task to repeatedly execute the VBScript. The VBScript used PowerShell to download tools like Mimikatz and a custom BAT script to collect system data. The BAT script gathered info on the logged in user, hostname, network data, accounts, processes, etc. The VBScript exfiltrated this via DNS by encoding data in subdomain names. The macro also unhid additional benign content in the Excel sheet after executing to avoid suspicion. While not highly sophisticated, the attack combined macros, scripts, scheduled tasks, open source tools, and DNS exfiltration to target Middle Eastern banks. It exemplifies social engineering, living off the land techniques, and a multistage infection chain to infiltrate and gather intelligence from financial organizations.
