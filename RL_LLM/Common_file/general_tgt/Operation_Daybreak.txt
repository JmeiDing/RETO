The PDF describes a cyberattack campaign called Operation Daybreak carried out by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as ScarCruft. The campaign targeted high-profile victims through spear-phishing emails containing a link to a hacked website hosting an exploit kit. The exploit kit contained a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2016-4171) that allowed remote code execution. It implemented several evasion techniques to avoid detection, such as encrypted payloads. After exploitation, it delivered a multi-stage malware payload. One stage used a clever technique to bypass security products by abusing the Windows DDE protocol to silently execute malicious scripts and install further payloads. The final payload connected to a command and control server and contained rare malware reserved for high-value targets. Researchers discovered the attacks in March 2016 and observed dozens of victims, primarily in Asia. Victims included law enforcement, major corporations, athletic organizations, and a restaurant. The threat actors behind ScarCruft are quite sophisticated and continue to deploy zero-days and rare malware in targeted attacks. Recommendations include using a multi-layered defense with traditional antivirus, patching, whitelisting, and limiting the attack surface. While 100% protection is impossible, increasing defenses forces attackers to look for easier targets. The key is making attacks inefficient for the adversaries.
