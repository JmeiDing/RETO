The report from SentinelOne details the activities of a prolific cyber mercenary group called Void Balaur. Void Balaur operates a hack-for-hire service and has been active since at least 2016. They offer their services publicly online to gain access to email, social media, and corporate accounts. Void Balaur continues to expand their campaigns in 2022, targeting a wide variety of industries and individuals with particular business or political ties to Russia. They also go after targets valuable for facilitating future attacks. Their infrastructure now includes over 5,000 domains used to target victims globally. Phishing emails are often generic in theme but may be tailored with more relevant themes. The group seeks credentials for major email and social media platforms, even those using multi-factor authentication. A unique connection was found linking Void Balaur infrastructure to the Russian Federal Protective Service (FSO) for a brief period, a potential indication of a customer relationship or resource sharing. Void Balaur has historically targeted critics of Russia, journalists, and public figures. Recent targeting focuses on those with interests in geopolitics, law, and business related to Russia. Locations span Russia, Ukraine, US, UK, Taiwan, and more. The report provides extensive technical details on Void Balaur's infrastructure, phishing tactics, and malware. It demonstrates the evolution and scale of a prolific cyber mercenary group offering hack-for-hire services to a global customer base, while maintaining suspected ties to Russian state interests.
