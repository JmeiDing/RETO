The PDF is a report by Booz Allen Hamilton that provides a comprehensive review of the cyberattacks against Ukrainian critical infrastructure in 2015. The attacks involved threat actors using BlackEnergy malware to conduct an attack campaign from May 2014 through January 2016, culminating in the first ever publicly acknowledged attack to disrupt a power grid in December 2015. The attacks involved extensive reconnaissance by threat actors to gather intelligence on potential targets in the electricity, railway, mining, media, and government sectors. The actors then developed tailored malware tools, including weaponized Microsoft Office documents that delivered the BlackEnergy remote access trojan when users enabled macros. Once inside target networks, the threat actors conducted further internal reconnaissance, stole valid credentials, and moved laterally to identify critical systems. In the final attack, the actors opened breakers at electricity distribution facilities using existing remote access services, causing blackouts. The attackers also delivered corrupt firmware updates to serial-to-Ethernet converters, severing the connection between substations and control centers. Additional denial-of-service attacks were conducted against telephone call centers to inhibit incident response. Finally, the actors executed disk-wiping malware on systems across the corporate and control networks to destroy data. The report highlights opportunities for detection and prevention across the attack sequence and provides mitigation recommendations focused on implementing defense-in-depth using tools for access control, monitoring, system backup, and incident response planning. The report concludes that well-resourced, disciplined threat actors pose a significant risk, but that operators can effectively address these threats by layering security controls to raise costs and likelihood of detection.
