The PDF discusses attacks exploiting the CVE-2018-0798 vulnerability in Microsoft Equation Editor. CVE-2018-0798 is an RCE vulnerability, a stack buffer overflow that can be exploited by a threat actor to perform stack corruption. This vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution when parsing equation data in documents. The vulnerable subroutine is located at the relative virtual address 0x43f6c (sub_443f6c). Researchers discovered multiple Chinese cyberespionage groups exploiting CVE-2018-0798 in attacks since late 2018. The groups were using the "Royal Road" Rich Text Format (RTF) weaponizer to deliver their malware. This weaponizer was previously seen exploiting other Equation Editor flaws like CVE-2017-11882. The earliest sample exploiting CVE-2018-0798 was seen in October 2018. The threat actors had likely used the exploit exclusively for 6 months before it started appearing in commodity malware. The groups exploiting it include Emissary Panda, KeyBoy, Rancor, Conimes, and Temp.Trident. They targeted Mongolia, Russia, Vietnam, Laos, and other Asian countries. The weaponized Office documents used social engineering lures related to military, government, and diplomatic entities. When opened, the documents drop malware payloads via OLE objects, scripts, scheduled tasks, etc. Observed payloads include remote access tools, backdoors, and next-stage downloaders. The payloads communicate with command and control servers located in Hong Kong, Russia, and other areas. The exploit works against all versions of Microsoft Equation Editor. The actors modify the exploit code to evade antivirus detection. Continued monitoring is needed to detect new attacks using this reliable exploit.
