The document analyzes cyberespionage campaigns targeting Taiwan's semiconductor industry between 2018-2019, attributed to a group named Chimera APT. - The attacks focused on stealing proprietary data like IC chip designs and source code from major semiconductor companies. The malware uses memory modules to evade detection and perform process injection. It also utilizes scheduled tasks and network commands to gather information and dump credentials. - Tactics involved phishing to gain initial access, then use of Cobalt Strike and customized malware like SkeletonKeyInjector for persistence and lateral movement. - SkeletonKeyInjector contains code from Mimikatz and Dumpert to manipulate user accounts and implant skeleton keys on domain controllers. - Cobalt Strike binaries masqueraded as Google Update to avoid detection, with C2 servers on Google Cloud Platform. - A modified RAR binary called RecordedTV.ms was used for data exfiltration. - Similar infrastructure and targeting indicates these were conducted by a single Chinese threat actor seeking semiconducter intelligence. - The report provides analysis of the malware involved, timeline of two representative cases, MITRE ATT&CK techniques, and IOCs. - It advises semiconductor vendors to improve security mechanisms to prevent such cyberespionage campaigns targeting intellectual property. In summary, this threat report profiles cyberespionage campaigns likely by a Chinese APT group against Taiwan semiconductor companies to steal key data, using custom malware like SkeletonKeyInjector.
