The PDF discusses new malware samples discovered in May 2020 that appear to be from the Chinese state-sponsored hacking group APT15, also known as Ke3chang. The malware combines features from two previous APT15 malware families, Ketrican and Okrum, into a new family named Ketrum. Analysis shows the Ketrum malware connecting to a command and control server registered in late 2019 in China, indicating the malware was likely compiled recently in mid-May 2020. The new Ketrum malware has two versions. Ketrum 1 incorporates Okrum features like using proxies and communicating via cookies. Ketrum 2 is more minimalist, supporting fewer commands. The malware code reuse across families shows multiple APT15 teams use similar high-level logic but differ in low-level implementation. Overall, the PDF analysis shows that APT15 has maintained their strategy of morphing malware code across operations without significantly changing their overall development approach over time. The new Ketrum malware shows the group's continued efforts to evolve and refine their tools while maintaining access to compromised systems.
