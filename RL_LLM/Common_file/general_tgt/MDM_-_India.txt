The PDF describes a highly targeted malware campaign against 13 iPhones in India that was discovered by Cisco Talos. The attacker used an open-source mobile device management (MDM) system to enroll the victim devices and maintain control over them. The enrollment was likely done through physical access or social engineering to trick the user into accepting the MDM. Once enrolled, the MDM allowed the attacker to install malicious apps, including compromised versions of Telegram and WhatsApp. These apps steal data like contacts, messages, location, and photos and exfiltrate it to a command and control server. The malware uses the BOptions technique to inject code into the apps to achieve this. Analysis of the infrastructure suggests the attacker is based in India, despite attempts to imply otherwise through false flags like Russian email addresses. The campaign has been ongoing since 2015 but has only targeted around 13 devices, likely specific individuals. While the exact purpose and targets are unknown, the report demonstrates the risks of allowing external management of mobile devices which provides deep access. It also highlights the need for social engineering awareness when users receive unsolicited requests on their devices.
