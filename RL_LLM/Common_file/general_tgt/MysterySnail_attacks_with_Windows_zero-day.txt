The PDF describes cyberattacks by a threat actor dubbed MysterySnail that exploited a new Windows zero-day vulnerability. The zero-day exploit elevates privileges on Windows servers by targeting a use-after-free flaw in the Win32k kernel driver. Kaspersky discovered attacks using this exploit in late August 2021 and promptly reported it to Microsoft. Microsoft assigned CVE-2021-40449 to the vulnerability and patched it in the October 2021 Patch Tuesday update. The exploit supports a wide range of Windows versions including Server 2008 through 2019. Kaspersky believes it was sold as a server privilege escalation exploit. The attacks delivered a remote access trojan dubbed MysterySnail RAT that gathers system info and can execute commands. The RAT has various anti-analysis features and tried to hide its C2 communications. Kaspersky connected these attacks to a Chinese-speaking advanced persistent threat actor called IronHusky. Evidence showed the group has been active since at least 2012, targeting IT companies, military contractors, and diplomatic entities. In summary, the PDF provides details on a new Windows zero-day exploit used by a sophisticated cyberespionage actor in attacks starting in August 2021. Kaspersky worked with Microsoft to patch the vulnerability used in the exploits.
