The PDF describes a targeted cyber attack campaign called "Operation LagTime IT" conducted by a Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as TA428. The targets were government agencies in East Asia responsible for information technology, domestic affairs, foreign affairs, economic development, and political processes. The attacks started in early 2019 and involved spear phishing emails with malicious RTF file attachments. The RTF files exploited the CVE-2018-0798 vulnerability in Microsoft Equation Editor to install a custom malware called Cotx RAT. Some emails also distributed Poison Ivy malware. The Cotx RAT malware communicates with command and control servers using encrypted channels. It can execute commands sent by the attacker, including opening a remote shell, stealing files, and taking screenshots. The Poison Ivy malware shared infrastructure and targeting overlap with Cotx RAT, indicating coordination as part of the same Operation LagTime IT campaign. Technical details are provided on the malware delivery techniques, encryption keys, configuration details, and command and control infrastructure. Links are made to a previous 2013 cyber espionage operation that resembles this new activity. The report concludes that Operation LagTime IT represents Chinese state-sponsored efforts to satisfy intelligence requirements by compromising high-value targets in neighboring East Asian governments.
