The cybersecurity firm Cluster25 analyzed a recent cyberattack attributed to the Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) group Naikon. Naikon has been active for over a decade, conducting espionage campaigns against foreign governments in Southeast Asia. This latest attack used spear phishing to deliver malware to the target. The spear phishing email contained a weaponized Word document with hidden payloads in the document properties. When opened, a macro extracted and executed these payloads which consisted of a loader program called HexINI and an encoded shellcode. HexINI decoded the shellcode from an INI file and injected it into a new svchost.exe process. The injected shellcode was a beacon that connected to a command and control server to receive additional commands. Analysis of the beacon revealed it was created using a Chinese hacking tool called Viper, which is similar to Cobalt Strike. The command server was also running an asset reconnaissance tool called ARL. Cluster25 believes this attack targeted a government organization in Southeast Asia based on Naikon's previous targeting of foreign affairs and military agencies. They provided indicators of compromise and recommendations for hunting and detecting Naikon's tactics, techniques, and procedures. The report demonstrates Naikon is still active and uses custom malware along with open-source red team tools to conduct espionage in the region.
