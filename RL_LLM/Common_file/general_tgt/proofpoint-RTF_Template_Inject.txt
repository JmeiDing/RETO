The cybersecurity company Proofpoint has identified a new phishing technique called RTF template injection being used by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. RTF template injection allows threat actors to retrieve malicious content from a remote URL using a rich text format (RTF) file. It works by altering the RTF file's document formatting properties to point to a URL rather than a local file template. Proofpoint has observed three APT groups aligned with India, Russia, and China using this technique in 2021 to target various entities. The groups include DoNot Team, TA423, and Gamaredon. The technique is simple to implement, making it an ideal phishing vector. It currently has a lower detection rate compared to Office document template injection techniques. Proofpoint assesses that RTF template injection could soon be adopted more widely by cybercriminals beyond targeted attacks. The ease of use and effectiveness compared to other template injection techniques makes it likely to spread. Defenders should watch for signs of this technique being used more broadly as a new phishing tactic. Proofpoint provides examples of the RTF injection process, screenshots of it in use, details on the groups using it, and indicators of compromise.
