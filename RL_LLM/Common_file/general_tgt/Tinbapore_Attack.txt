The report analyzes a new variant of the Tinba banking Trojan called Tinbapore that actively targets financial entities in Asia Pacific. Tinba steals banking credentials and initiates unauthorized money transfers. Tinbapore infects systems by injecting into legitimate processes like explorer.exe and using auto-run registry entries for persistence. It hooks system and browser functions to intercept traffic and perform injections. The malware downloads webinject configuration files from its command and control server to modify clients' web pages and steal credentials or initiate transfers. Analysis of the webinjects shows targeting of banks in Singapore, Indonesia, and other APAC countries. Tinbapore uses rootkit techniques to hide its files and registry keys. It lowers browser security settings to enable seamless injections without prompts. The malware exfiltrates logged data before removing temporary files. The F5 SOC detected and shut down Tinbapore command and control resources in real time using F5 WebSafe. However, Tinbapore's domain generation algorithm makes it highly persistent. The report concludes millions are at risk, with Singapore banks accounting for 30% of observed targeting.
