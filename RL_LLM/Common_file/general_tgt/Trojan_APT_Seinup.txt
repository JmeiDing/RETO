The PDF analyzes a new trojan called Trojan.APT.Seinup used in spear phishing campaigns targeting Asia and ASEAN countries. Key techniques: Uses Google Docs for C2 callbacks to evade detection. Encrypts payloads with XOR and a custom base64 variant. Digitally signs callbacks with salted hashes. Loads malicious DLL manually into memory only. Infection starts with a weaponized RTF exploiting CVE-2012-0158. This drops a malicious DLL loaded via DLL side-loading. The DLL phones home and acts as a backdoor. Persistence is achieved by installing the DLL as a service. Capabilities include downloading/executing files, opening remote shells, etc. Attribution is based on registrar info pointing to Chinese origins. The malware is sophisticated, using cryptography and anti-forensics to avoid detection. Recommendations include stopping initial exploits, monitoring for unusual Google Docs usage, and endpoint visibility into anomalous activity.
