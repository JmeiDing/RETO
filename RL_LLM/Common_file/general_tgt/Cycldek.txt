The PDF describes analysis of a Chinese-speaking threat actor group called Cycldek, also known as Goblin Panda or Conimes. Cycldek has been active since around 2012, primarily targeting government organizations and institutions in Vietnam and other parts of Southeast Asia. The group uses an open-source framework called PcShare or PcClient, which is now available on Github. Researchers uncovered extensive new information about Cycldek's activities and tools since 2018. Their analysis identified two distinct subsets of activity indicating two separate operational entities working under one group. The two clusters, nicknamed BlueCore and RedCore, used variants of a custom malware called NewCore RAT. Both implants share code similarities suggesting a common developer but have unique features indicating different purposes. The malware they use, NewCore RAT, provides attackers with capabilities such as file operations, screenshots, remote shell control, and system shutdown/restart. BlueCore is linked to attacks distributing RTF documents to Vietnamese targets. RedCore began in Vietnam but shifted focus to Laos by end of 2018. Both used phishing emails with exploits to infect systems. Researchers uncovered a wide range of tools used by Cycldek for lateral movement and information stealing, including custom malware like a USB-based exfiltration tool called USBCulprit. Other tools were copied from public repositories or living-off-the-land binaries like sysadmin utilities. Shared infrastructure and tools between the clusters indicate they operate under the same Cycldek group umbrella, despite some uncoordinated activity. The attacks are ongoing with evolving tactics, showing Cycldek has broad capabilities against high-profile Asian targets. In summary, the analysis provides extensive new technical details on the Cycldek APT's infrastructure, malware variants, victim targeting, and access/data theft tools. It reveals a sophisticated, multi-legged threat actor actively targeting Southeast Asian governments.
