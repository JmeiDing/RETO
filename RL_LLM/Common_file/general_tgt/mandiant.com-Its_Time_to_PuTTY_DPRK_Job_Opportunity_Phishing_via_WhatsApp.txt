The document describes a novel phishing campaign by a threat actor tracked as UNC4034, suspected to have ties to North Korea. The phishing utilized WhatsApp and ISO files to distribute a trojanized version of PuTTY leading to deployment of the AIRDRY backdoor. Key points:In July 2022, Mandiant identified UNC4034 communicating with a media company employee over WhatsApp, posing as Amazon and offering a fake job opportunity. UNC4034 sent the victim an ISO file titled "amazon_assessment.iso" containing a trojanized PuTTY executable and instructions to connect to a remote server. When the malicious PuTTY binary connected to the remote server, it installed additional malware - a publicly available shellcode dropper called DAVESHELL and a new version of the AIRDRY backdoor tracked as AIRDRY.V2. Analysis shows the trojanized PuTTY was derived from public PuTTY source code version 0.77 and contained implanted malicious code to drop the next stage payload. AIRDRY.V2 has a modular, plugin-based architecture and supports HTTP, SMB, and file communication modes. Its configuration structure is similar to earlier AIRDRY versions. Infrastructure and tactics suggest UNC4034 has ties to North Korean threat actors, extending similar "Operation Dream Job" campaigns involving fake job lures. The report provides detection opportunities and IOCs based on the trojanized files, scheduled tasks, and other clues from the attack chain.
