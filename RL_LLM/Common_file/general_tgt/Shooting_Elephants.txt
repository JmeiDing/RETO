The document provides an analysis of a sophisticated Windows malware dubbed "Babar" and "Babar64". Babar is a modular spyware tool capable of keylogging, screen capturing, recording audio streams, and stealing clipboard data. It uses API hooking and other techniques to extract information from browsers, office applications, and chat programs. The Babar dropper and implant are designed to steal data from various applications, including instant messengers, softphones, browsers, and office applications. The Babar dropper uses the Windows regsvr32.exe command to load its DLL into target processes. The Babar dropper employs the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm with 128-bit keys for encryption and decryption of its DLL file. The Babar dropper has a specific set of APIs that it hooks into, including internet communication, file creation, and media functions. The Babar dropper collects keylogging data from intercepted internet communication and saves it in an update.msi-file, which also contains system-specific information about infected hosts. The malware injects into multiple processes for redundancy and load balancing. It applies global Windows hooks to invade arbitrary desktop processes. Configuration details reveal its extensive spying capabilities. Anti-analysis measures like API name obfuscation are present but limited. The command and control servers were hosted on compromised legitimate websites. "Babar64" links this malware to previous reports on a potential nation-state campaign dubbed "Babar" tied to French intelligence. However, while infrastructure overlaps, compilation timestamps suggest this is a newer version active 2011-2013. Code similarities also exist with other malware like Bunny and NBOT/TFC. The precise origins are inconclusive but the capabilities and nature of the malware suggest development by skilled software engineers, rather than cybercriminals. In summary, Babar exemplifies sophisticated, modular malware built for targeted surveillance. Its continuous evolution over multiple strains illustrates the persistence of its creators.
