The document describes a malware attack attributed to the threat actor group TeamTNT targeting Kubernetes containers to steal AWS credentials. The initial infection occurred by exploiting a misconfigured Kubernetes dashboard to gain access to a WordPress pod. The attackers then used wget to download a bash script that attempts to steal AWS keys using the EC2 instance metadata endpoint. The metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254) provides information about an EC2 instance including IAM role credentials. The script extracts the AWS access key ID, secret access key, and session token and exfiltrates them to a remote server. This allows the attackers to move laterally in the cloud environment and leverage the stolen credentials. Recommended mitigations include disabling metadata access, using IMDSv2 for metadata, restricting IAM roles, and principle of least privilege. Detection can happen through runtime tools like Falco that monitor for unexpected connections to the metadata endpoint or commands like grep searching for credentials. Sysdig Secure also has relevant rules to detect based on indicators of compromise. The attack shows the evolution of TeamTNT to target cloud infrastructure and steal credentials for lateral movement. It also demonstrates the importance of restricting metadata access and minimizing permissions to reduce the impact of compromised workloads.
