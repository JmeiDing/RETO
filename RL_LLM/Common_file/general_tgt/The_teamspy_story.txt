The PDF provides an in-depth analysis of a cyberespionage operation called "TeamSpy" that has been active since at least 2008, targeting victims in Russia, former Soviet states, the Middle East, and elsewhere. TeamSpy utilizes custom malware tools along with legitimate software like TeamViewer for remote access. The malware includes capabilities to collect files, log keystrokes, take screenshots, steal credentials, and exfiltrate data. The command and control infrastructure uses domains registered with fake identities. The malware relies on social engineering techniques to infect victims, including fake security software, disturbing videos prompting downloads, and documents purporting to leak government information. The number of victims is estimated to exceed 10,000 based on infection statistics. The report provides technical details on the capabilities of the various TeamSpy malware samples analyzed, including the Avicap32 module that hijacks TeamViewer for stealthy remote access. Other tools harvest iOS device history, gather system information, scan for files matching certain keywords, and collect network share data. The attackers seem motivated primarily by cyberespionage and surveillance rather than financial theft. They maintain a database of infected systems and harvested data on their command servers. The report concludes that TeamSpy is not as advanced as some state-sponsored groups, but has managed to operate successfully for many years through clever malware obfuscation and social engineering.
