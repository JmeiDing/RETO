The report describes a second wave of destructive cyberattacks in November 2016 associated with the Shamoon malware, which originally targeted Saudi Arabia in 2012. This new variant of Shamoon, dubbed Shamoon 2, contained a Disttrack wiper component to destroy data on infected systems. The new attacks targeted a second organization in Saudi Arabia, with the wiper module set to activate on November 29. The malware spread through the network using stolen credentials that met password complexity requirements, suggesting a prior breach to steal this data. Notable aspects include the wiper overwriting the MBR and partition tables with an image to disable bootup, and the inclusion of default credentials for a Huawei VDI product, implying intended disruption of virtual desktop infrastructure. As with the previous Shamoon attacks, the lack of an operational command and control server suggests the main intent was destructive wiping of systems. The hardcoded activation date shows an attempt to maximize impact during off-hours. In summary, the report provides analysis of a second phase of Shamoon 2 attacks in November 2016, highlighting the continued evolution of its data-wiping capabilities and targeting against Saudi Arabian entities.
