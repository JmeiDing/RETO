The document details an investigation by Quick Heal Technologies into an advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign targeting Indian defense organizations dubbed "Operation SideCopy." The operation has been active since early 2019 and uses spearphishing emails with weaponized LNK files to infect victims and deploy a multi-stage malware infection chain. The initial infection delivers decoy documents and a HTA file that uses .NET serialization to execute additional payloads. The HTA stages use open source tools like CACTUSTORCH and DotNetToJScript for fileless techniques. The final payload is a remote access trojan (RAT) that allows the attackers to perform various malicious actions on the infected system. The RAT shares similarities with open source Delphi code on GitHub. The infrastructure includes domains registered with suspicious email IDs and C2 servers hosted with Contabo GmbH, which have been associated with Pakistan-linked threat actors. The attackers are constantly updating their tools and tactics and customizing malware after reconnaissance of the target networks. The operation copies TTPs associated with the Sidewinder APT group as a false flag, but evidence points to links with the Transparent Tribe APT instead. This APT focuses on targets in India, especially defense entities. IOCs are provided including HTA and malware hashes, domains, IPs, PDB paths, and other technical details identified during analysis. In summary, this appears to be an ongoing sophisticated, targeted attack campaign against Indian defense organizations by a suspected Pakistani APT group masquerading as a different threat actor.
