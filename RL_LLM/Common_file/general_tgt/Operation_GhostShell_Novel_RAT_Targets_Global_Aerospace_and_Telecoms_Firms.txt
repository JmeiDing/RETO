The PDF discusses Operation GhostShell, a cyberespionage campaign targeting aerospace and telecom firms that has been active since at least 2018. The threat actor is a newly identified Iranian group called MalKamak. The main malware utilized is a remote access trojan (RAT) named ShellClient that has been under continuous development since 2018. ShellClient has evolved from a simple reverse shell to a stealthy, modular RAT incorporating encryption, obfuscation, and command and control via Dropbox to blend in with legitimate traffic. Attacks begin with reconnaissance and malware installation. ShellClient gathers system info and exfiltrates sensitive documents and data to Dropbox accounts controlled by the attackers. Additional tools like credential dumpers, lateral movement utilities, and archiving software facilitate data theft and maintaining persistence. While connections exist to other Iranian groups like Chafer APT and Agrius APT, MalKamak appears to be a distinct threat actor targeting the Middle East and global aerospace/telecom companies specifically. The ongoing development of ShellClient and infrastructure links to Iran point to MalKamak being a cyber espionage unit with likely state sponsorship. Defenders are advised to monitor for the indicators of compromise provided and use the MITRE ATT&CK framework breakdown to check for MalKamak's tactics, techniques, and procedures on their networks. The research aims to bring visibility to this formerly unknown threat.
