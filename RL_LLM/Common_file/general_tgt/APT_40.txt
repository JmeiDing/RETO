APT40, also known as China-Nexus, is a state-sponsored Chinese cyber espionage operation. The group has been active since at least 2013 and specifically targets engineering, transportation, and defense industries, especially where these sectors overlap with maritime technologies. It has also targeted countries strategically important to the Belt and Road Initiative. Attribution to China is based on targeting aligning with Chinese interests, timestamps, domain registrations, and IP addresses located in China. Initial access is gained via web exploitation, phishing, and compromising websites. Backdoors like CHOPPER and BADFLICK are used to establish a foothold. It then escalates privileges and dump password hashes using custom and publicly available credential harvesting tools. Recon is done with native Windows commands and MURKYSHELL. Web shells maintain presence. Data is gathered into archives before exfiltration. APT40 operations are expected to continue, evolving based on China's strategic interests.
