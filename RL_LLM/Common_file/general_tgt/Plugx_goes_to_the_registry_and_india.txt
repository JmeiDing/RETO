The PDF analyzes new variants of the PlugX remote access trojan (RAT) used in targeted attacks against India. Recently, PlugX payloads have been stored encrypted in the registry instead of standalone files. The loader component decrypts and executes the payload from the registry key. These registry-stored versions use a new peer-to-peer communication capability for command and control. The payloads have version identifiers indicating ongoing development. The initial infection vectors are weaponized documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158. Some use a complex multi-stage shellcode installer. The decoy documents are corrupted on launch. In addition to PlugX, the attacks distribute other RATs like Smoaler and Nineblog that also have ties to PlugX operations. The groups shows skilled malware development. The loaders mimic legitimate signed files from security vendors. The C2 servers use dynamic DNS and domains registered to cover identities in China. While PlugX has traditionally targeted Asia, the registry-storing versions focus on India. The attacks continue to expand to new targets and use new techniques.
