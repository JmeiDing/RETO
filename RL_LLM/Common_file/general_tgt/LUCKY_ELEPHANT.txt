The PDF describes a credential harvesting campaign called LUCKY ELEPHANT uncovered by researchers in early 2019. The actors behind it created doppelganger websites mimicking government, military, and telecom entities in South Asian countries. The fake sites were used to trick victims into entering login credentials. The campaign targeted Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal and more by copying their official websites. The doppelganger sites were hosted on domains with TLDs that provide anonymity. Email phishing was likely used to direct victims to the fake sites. One IP address used in the campaign was previously associated with the suspected Indian APT group DoNot Team that heavily targets Pakistan. The targeting aligns with Indian intelligence interests in the region. However, one domain was previously used in a Chinese cyber espionage campaign, possibly intended as a false flag. The campaign demonstrates the continued effectiveness of social engineering for credential theft. Users should be wary of any emails asking them to login, use multifactor authentication, and watch for abnormal account activity. Admins should reset credentials immediately in the event of a compromise.
