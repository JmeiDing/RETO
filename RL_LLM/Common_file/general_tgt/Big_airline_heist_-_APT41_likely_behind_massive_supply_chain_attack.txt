The document provides an analysis by Group-IB of a supply chain cyberattack campaign named ColunmTK that targeted Air India and likely other airlines through compromise of the SITA airline IT services provider. The attackers used a combination of Cobalt Strike and custom malware to establish persistence, move laterally, and exfiltrate over 200MB of data from Air India systems. Compromised devices communicated with adversary infrastructure that Group-IB links to the Chinese state-sponsored threat actor APT41 with moderate confidence based on TTP overlaps. The initial infection vector is unknown but evidence suggests the campaign started with compromise of SITA given that the first infected system was a SITA server inside Air India's network. Lateral movement occurred over at least 2 months via credential theft and use of tools like Mimikatz. Technical details are provided on the custom UP007 and SLServer malware families used, including encryption schemes, C2 communication, and anti-analysis features. Infrastructure analysis connects the campaign to previous cyber espionage operations targeting Southeast Asia, Tibet, and Hong Kong. The supply chain compromise of SITA to access customer airlines highlights systemic risk. Group-IB estimates the campaign could impact a majority of the airline industry given SITA's customer base. Indicators of compromise and mitigation recommendations are included to help potential victims detect the threat actor. Attribution to APT41 is assessed as moderate confidence based on infrastructure reuse.
