The report by White Ops describes the discovery of a large-scale connected TV (CTV) botnet attack named ICEBUCKET uncovered in early 2020. ICEBUCKET conducted ad fraud by mimicking legitimate CTV and mobile video ad requests at scale. At its peak, ICEBUCKET impersonated over 2 million devices across 30 countries and 300 fake publishers. The botnet spoofed CTV and mobile server-side ad insertion (SSAI) to trick advertisers into thinking real viewers saw video ads, when it was bots. ICEBUCKET used over 1,000 fake user agents and IP addresses to look like real viewers. The operation accounted for 28% of programmatic CTV traffic seen by White Ops in January 2020. The report explains how SSAI spoofing works and why it is an attractive vector. White Ops blocked the attack for partners by identifying the botnet's signatures and preventing the fraudulent traffic. However, ICEBUCKET remains active at lower volumes. The report recommends partnerships, transparency, and standards to counter such threats. It concludes sophisticated bots follow the money into emerging channels like CTV, requiring vigilance.
