The report details an espionage campaign targeting Italian users dubbed Operation Pistacchietto. The attackers used malware for Windows, Linux, MacOS, and Android devices to infect victims. Initial infection starts with a fake Java update page that downloads a Windows batch script. The script executes commands to download additional components like a Python backdoor, Netcat, Wget, and more. It also creates persistence via scheduled tasks. The main payloads are Python backdoors that connect to command and control servers and execute commands provided by the attacker. Other files download additional backdoors, run reverse shells, etc. Network traffic goes to servers located in Italy, which along with Italian words in code, suggests the attacker is of Italian origin. The campaign has been active for years. The malware is constantly changed to evade detection, with new copies that modify code but keep the same behavior. Attacker infrastructure includes GitHub for development and Google Drive for hosting. In addition to Windows malware, the attacker created backdoors for Linux, OSX, and Android. These are based on open-source tools like AhMyth RAT, but modified. While the amateurish nature may suggest a less serious threat, the targeting across platforms shows the capability for a long-running, multi-platform espionage operation, warranting attention.
