The cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks analyzed a new malware downloader called Cmstar that is being used in targeted cyberespionage attacks. Cmstar is related to the Lurid/Enfal downloader also used in attacks. Cmstar is delivered via spear phishing emails containing weaponized Office documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158. Two malware builder kits, MNKit and Tran Duy Linh, have been observed generating the exploit documents. Cmstar has some interesting technical features such as manually building its import address table and using a hashing algorithm to check for antivirus processes. Its unique feature is manually building its import address table (IAT) using a character to offset array technique. It connects to command and control servers with "cgl-bin" in the URL, similar to the Lurid Cmwhite downloader. Instead of including a list of associated processes, Cmstar enumerates running processes and hashes their names against specific values. Unit 42 reverse engineered the algorithm and created a function to generate hashes for process discovery. Cmstar specifically looks for Kaspersky's Anti-virus product (avp.exe) running on compromised systems. Infrastructure analysis found overlaps between Cmstar, Lurid/Enfal, and scam websites, with shared domain registration patterns. The initial registrant email address wangminghua6@gmail.com registers the domains first before they are transferred to the current info. C2 domains and IP addresses were provided as indicators of compromise. Yara rules and MD5 hashes were also provided to detect Cmstar malware samples and related Lurid/Enfal tools. The report shows how attackers continually evolve their malware, but infrastructure habits can reveal connections to previous activity.
