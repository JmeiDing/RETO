The document describes malware campaigns by the Lazarus cyberespionage group targeting organizations in the Netherlands and Belgium in late 2021. - The targets received spearphishing emails with job offer lures containing malicious documents. If opened, multiple malware stages were deployed. - The malware includes droppers, loaders, backdoors, uploaders/downloaders. Some are custom, others based on open source software. - A notable tool abuses a Dell driver vulnerability (CVE-2021-21551) to disable security monitoring in the Windows kernel. This is the first recorded use of this vulnerability. - The backdoor BLINDINGCAN provides extensive remote access, including command execution, file operations, process control, etc. It uses HTTP/HTTPS for command and control. - Another custom backdoor, LookBack, uses a custom encrypted network protocol over HTTP or raw TCP. - The malware stages exhibit sophisticated evasion like encryption, obfuscation, anti-analysis tricks, hijacked DLL loading, rootkitting, etc. - Infrastructure overlaps suggest the Lazarus subgroups share some resources but operate independently with different tools. - The attacks demonstrate Lazarus continues compromising targets worldwide through tailored social engineering and custom malware. The technical sophistication shows the resources invested in Lazarus operations.
