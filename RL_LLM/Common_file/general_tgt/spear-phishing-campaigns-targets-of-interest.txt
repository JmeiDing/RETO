The PDF describes ongoing spear phishing campaigns conducted by two threat actors, Russia-based SEABORGIUM (also known as Callisto Group, TA446, COLDDRIVER, and TAG-53) and Iran-based TA453 (also known as APT42, Charming Kitten, Yellow Garuda, and ITG18). Throughout 2022, these groups targeted organizations and individuals in the UK, as well as other areas of interest, including academia, defense, government, NGOs, think tanks, politicians, journalists, and activists. The campaigns involve research and preparation, identifying potential targets through open sources and building profiles. The actors establish fake online accounts impersonating experts or contacts to build rapport with targets. They eventually send emails with malicious links impersonating known contacts or eminent individuals in the target's field. The links direct victims to fake login pages to harvest credentials. Once credentials are stolen, the actors access email accounts to gather further information for targeting and set up mail forwarding rules to maintain access. They use details from compromised accounts for further phishing attempts. The report outlines mitigations like strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, keeping systems updated, monitoring for suspicious emails, and enabling automated scanning by email providers. It aims to raise awareness of these actors' techniques among frequently targeted sectors so potential targets can remain vigilant.
