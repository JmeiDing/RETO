The document describes analysis by DCSO CyTec of a new backdoor malware called Maggie that targets Microsoft SQL servers. Maggie is implemented as an Extended Stored Procedure DLL and controlled via SQL queries once loaded on a server. An attacker needs to place an ESP file in a directory accessible by the MSSQL server and have valid credentials to load the Maggie ESP into the server. Key capabilities of Maggie include command execution, file/folder interactions, network bridging, SOCKS proxy, and SQL login bruteforcing. Maggie can act as a bridgehead into the server's network when enabled. The bruteforce functionality adds a hardcoded backdoor user to admins it compromises. Scanning identified over 250 affected servers globally, concentrated in Asia-Pacific. Maggie contains functionality for simple TCP redirection, allowing it to function as a network bridge head from the Internet to any IP address reachable by the infected MSSQL server. Maggie's command set includes four exploit commands: Exploit AddUser, Exploit Run, Exploit Clone, and Exploit TS, which depend on a DLL not included with Maggie directly. Maggie also includes two bruteforce login commands: SqlScan and WinSockScan, which attempt to log in via SQL using ODBC or basic socket functions, respectively. Maggie's commands suggest planned exploit usage, though the exact exploits are unknown. Debug messages reference various backdoor functions like keylogging and screenshotting. In summary, Maggie is a novel SQL server backdoor controlled via SQL queries. It contains multiple stages for intrusion and pivoting. While the initial infection vector is unclear, scanning confirmed over 250 compromised servers primarily in Asia-Pacific. Maggie highlights the importance of locking down and monitoring privileged database accesses.
