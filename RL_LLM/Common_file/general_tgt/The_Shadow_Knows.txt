The document analyzes malvertising campaigns that used domain shadowing to redirect traffic to the Angler exploit kit (EK). Malvertisers aimed to gain access to major ad networks to reach high-quality website traffic. Researchers uncovered a campaign where a compromised ad agency served ads redirecting to the domain ads.mikeholt[.]com, which then went to the Angler EK landing page. Further investigation found other campaigns similarly using shadowed domains of legitimate websites. The shadowed domains used stolen credentials of the real domain owners to create fraudulent subdomains. These subdomains filtered traffic so only targeted victims reached the EK. The EK payload then checked for researchers and loaded malware like Bedep, Ursnif, and Vawtrak. The analysis explains how the attack chains utilize advanced techniques to obscure the trail back to the EK. Ad agencies performing targeting unknowingly aid the malicious actors. The threats evolve to bypass defenses, so malvertising remains an effective infection vector. The report contains indicators of compromise, network signatures, and mitigation recommendations for security teams to detect and prevent similar malvertising and domain shadowing campaigns abusing ad networks.
