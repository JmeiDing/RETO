The document details the activities of a China-based cyberespionage group called BRONZE VINEWOOD that has been active since at least 2016. The group's use of public code or file-sharing websites for its command and control (C2) domains can complicate network-based detection because the C2 traffic is interspersed amid legitimate web browsing activity. The group targets organizations in the U.S. and Europe that provide services to government and defense sectors, including software companies, legal firms, and consulting services. The threat actors aim to steal intellectual property, commercially sensitive data, and information on government/defense targets that would be of interest to the Chinese government. BRONZE VINEWOOD has used phishing and stolen credentials for initial access, followed by installing various malware like HanaLoader, Meterpreter, and Trochilus on target networks. They leverage legitimate remote access tools like RDP for persistent access. The group is notable for using public code repositories like GitHub and Dropbox for command and control. BRONZE VINEWOOD has deployed various tools and techniques, including zero-day exploits, to gain access to target environments, demonstrating technical proficiency. They exfiltrate data through archives encrypted with simple passwords. The report provides indicators of compromise and recommendations for security controls to detect and mitigate BRONZE VINEWOOD's tactics. It concludes that software providers and firms that work with government/defense are most at risk from this threat group's espionage activities.
