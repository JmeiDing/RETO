The report reveals a sophisticated campaign targeting Chinese language news sites including China Digital Times, Mingjing News, Epoch Times, HK01, and Bowen Press. The operators used tactics including reconnaissance, phishing, and malware delivery to target these sites over a period of at least 2 years. The campaign began with phishing attempts targeting China Digital Times, including emails with links to fake domains and login pages designed to steal credentials. Further investigation uncovered the use of additional fake domains mimicking other Chinese news sites for reconnaissance and malware delivery. The malware operation used packed executables and custom shellcode to deliver the NetWire remote access trojan. The malware made efforts to evade detection, including use of compromised servers to host the payload. The operators demonstrated patience and persistence, carefully moving from one target to the next over an extended period. The news sites targeted focus on politically sensitive topics in China. While this aligns with Chinese state interests, the report does not conclusively attribute the campaign to a state sponsor. The report highlights the ongoing threat of digital espionage faced by journalists and news organizations, especially those reporting on China. It emphasizes the need for newsrooms to prioritize information security while balancing openness, availability, and limited resources.
