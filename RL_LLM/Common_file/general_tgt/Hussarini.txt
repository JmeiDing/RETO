The document describes an analysis by FortiGuard Labs of a malicious Microsoft Word document that exploits the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability to drop a malware called Hussarini or Sarhust. Hussarini is a backdoor that has been used in targeted attacks against countries in Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines, since 2014. The exploit document pretends to be a draft Philippines-US dialogue on cybersecurity. If opened, it drops files that perform a DLL hijacking technique to load the Hussarini malware disguised as a legitimate DLL file. Hussarini connects to a command and control server, sends system info, and can execute commands received from the C&C including downloading files, creating files, and launching a remote shell. The malware uses obfuscation techniques like custom base64 encoding. Analysis suggests the attackers may be targeting the Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs based on clues in the document name, C&C domain, and decoy document URL. The report concludes that the Philippines continues to be a major target for cyber espionage given its developing cybersecurity defenses. FortiGuard has detections for the exploit document and Hussarini samples.
