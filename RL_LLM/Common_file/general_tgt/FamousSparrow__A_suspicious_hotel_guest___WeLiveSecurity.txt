The report describes a new cyberespionage group named FamousSparrow that has been active since at least 2019. The group targets hotels, governments, and companies worldwide. FamousSparrow compromised targets by exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Oracle Opera software. Once inside a network, the group deployed custom tools including a Mimikatz variant to gather credentials and a custom backdoor called SparrowDoor. SparrowDoor uses a complex multi-stage loading process involving DLL hijacking and encrypted shellcode. It connects to a command and control server to receive commands allowing remote control of the system. Network traffic is encrypted. FamousSparrow exploited the Microsoft Exchange ProxyLogon vulnerabilities starting in March 2021, showing they had early access. Attacks were seen against hotels in 13 countries across 5 continents. While FamousSparrow appears to be a separate entity, potential connections were found to other APT groups SparklingGoblin and DRBControl. The targeting of governments suggests an espionage motive. FamousSparrow utilizes numerous techniques for execution, persistence, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, exfiltration, and command and control. The report provides in-depth technical analysis of the SparrowDoor backdoor and indicators of compromise.
