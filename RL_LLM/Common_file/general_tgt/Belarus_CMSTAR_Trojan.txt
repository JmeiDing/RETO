The document details recent phishing attacks targeting the government of Belarus using updated versions of the CMSTAR malware family. The attacks occurred between June and August 2022 and targeted email addresses associated with Belarus government entities, primarily the Ministry of Defense. The phishing emails contained attachments with various file types that executed CMSTAR malware variants when opened. The malware connected to command and control servers to download additional payloads, including two new backdoor malware families named BYEBY and PYLOT. Researchers identified three updated CMSTAR variants (A, B, and C) used in the attacks, with minor modifications to the string obfuscation routines between versions. The malware collected system information from infected machines and communicated with C2 servers using encrypted HTTP requests. In total, 20 unique phishing emails were observed, using subject lines related to the Zapad 2017 Russia-Belarus military exercises. Decoy documents in the emails and attachments discussed Zapad 2017 as a lure. The PYLOT and BYEBY backdoors allowed attackers to execute commands, upload/download files, and interact with the compromised systems. The report provides indicators of compromise, including file hashes, C2 domains, and URLs used by the malware families. It also shares scripts created to analyze the malware, extract payloads, and decode commands. The attacks demonstrate an ongoing cyber espionage campaign targeting the Belarus government with updated malware.
