The PDF describes an analysis by ESET and CERT-UA of a cyberattack against a Ukrainian energy provider in April 2022. The attackers used a new version of the notorious Industroyer malware along with several disk wipers. The attack was scheduled for April 8th but evidence suggests it was planned for at least 2 weeks prior. Industroyer2 was set to activate at 4:10pm UTC to impact power systems. The original Industroyer malware caused a blackout in Ukraine in 2016. In addition to Industroyer2, the attackers used new versions of the destructive CaddyWiper malware for Windows and wipers targeting Linux and Solaris systems. CaddyWiper was deployed to disable operator workstations. Industroyer2 has a hardcoded configuration for communicating with industrial control devices to cut power. It appears to share source code with the original Industroyer but is more targeted. The attackers are attributed with high confidence to the Sandworm APT group linked to Russia. This shows attackers are continuing to target Ukrainian critical infrastructure. ESET recommends organizations bolster protections and monitoring to defend against destructive cyberattacks like those described in the PDF.
