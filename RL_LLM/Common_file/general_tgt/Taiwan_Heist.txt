The document analyzes a cyberattack on Far Eastern International Bank (FEIB) in Taiwan in early October 2017 that resulted in unauthorized money transfers. The attack has hallmarks of the Lazarus Group, prime suspects for the 2016 Bangladesh bank heist. - The attackers compromised FEIB's SWIFT network to send fraudulent MT103 transfer requests to steal funds. They also sent bogus MT202 cover messages. - Around $60M was initially reported stolen, but the actual loss seems to be lower since transfers were reversed. - The attackers used Windows malware, including a spreader tool to move laterally after initial infection and a Hermes ransomware variant likely intended as a distraction. - The malware includes Lazarus tools like a backdoor that provides C2 capabilities. The attack reused infrastructure from prior Lazarus campaigns. - An individual in Sri Lanka withdrew cash from one of the destinations accounts before being arrested. Other recipients are in Cambodia. - The report analyzes the malware's functionality in depth and provides IOCs, YARA rules, and recommendations for security controls like firewalling SMB, blacklisting risky utilities, and monitoring admin accounts. - The attack shows Lazarus continues to target banks despite limited success obtaining stolen funds. Their tactics are evolving to add disruption to evade response. Banks should hardened networks and practice response to complex attacks. In summary, the report gives a comprehensive look into the technical details and implications of this Lazarus cyber heist against a Taiwanese bank, demonstrating the group's ongoing threat to the financial sector.
