The report analyzes a rare malware family called AcidBox that was used in targeted attacks against Russian organizations in 2017.  AcidBox abuses a vulnerability in VirtualBox drivers that was previously used by the Turla APT group. It exploits additional unpatched vulnerabilities to disable driver signature enforcement and load its unsigned kernel driver. The malware uses a modular toolkit including loader modules installed as credential providers and a main worker module loaded from the registry. The main worker uses the VirtualBox exploit to load the kernel driver which can execute additional payloads. Analysis of artifacts like the compiler, export functions, custom status codes, and encryption indicates an advanced threat actor created AcidBox. While links to Turla are solely due to the reused exploit, attribution remains unclear. The malware managed to stay undetected until 2019. Its complex coding and targeted use suggest it was crafted for stealthy attacks and may still be in use today. Yara rules, IOCs, and a decryption script are provided to detect AcidBox.
