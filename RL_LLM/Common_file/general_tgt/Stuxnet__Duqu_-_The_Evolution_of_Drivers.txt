The document analyzes the evolution of the drivers used in the Stuxnet and Duqu malware created on the "Tilded" platform between 2007-2011. It reveals previously unknown Stuxnet drivers (rtniczw.sys and rndismpc.sys) in addition to the publicly known mrcls.sys and jmidebs.sys. The earliest driver rndismpc.sys was created in January 2008 and used an encryption key and registry key unique from later drivers. The next driver mrxcls.sys was the original Stuxnet driver from January 2009. A signed version was later created in March 2010 named rtniczw.sys, however it was never used in observed Stuxnet infections. jmidebs.sys was created in July 2010 also signed but never used. The drivers evolved from mrcls.sys to jmidebs.sys by expanding the list of APIs retrieved and increasing the stub size to inject modules. jmidebs.sys served as the basis for the drivers used in the Duqu malware between 2010-2011. The authors posit Stuxnet was one project utilizing an evolving malware platform and Duqu along with other unknown malware used it in parallel. Driver files were recompiled from a common codebase with modifications to evade detection. In summary, the document reveals an evolving, shared malware platform predating and underlying both Stuxnet and Duqu. It pieces together the creation timeline and modifications of multiple driver files by the authors providing insight into their methods.
