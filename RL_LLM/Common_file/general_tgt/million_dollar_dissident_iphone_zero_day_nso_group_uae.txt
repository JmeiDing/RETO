In August 2016, UAE human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor received suspicious text messages containing links to spyware. Researchers at Citizen Lab and Lookout analyzed the links and found they led to a sophisticated zero-day exploit chain called Trident that could remotely hack Mansoor's iPhone. Trident consisted of three zero-day vulnerabilities that allowed it to jailbreak the iPhone and install spyware developed by NSO Group called Pegasus. Pegasus could record calls, messages, track locations, and access contacts, calendars, passwords on the infected phone. Researchers believe UAE government operators used NSO Group's Pegasus spyware to target Mansoor. He was previously targeted in 2011 and 2012. NSO Group sells mobile spyware exclusively to governments. The high cost of iPhone zero-days suggests a state sponsor. After responsible disclosure, Apple developed a patch fixing the vulnerabilities in iOS 9.3.5, preventing the exploit. Evidence suggests dissidents in Mexico and opposition figures in Kenya were also targeted using NSO Group's infrastructure. The abuse of commercial spyware to target civil society persistently demonstrates the lack of regulation in this industry and raises human rights concerns.
