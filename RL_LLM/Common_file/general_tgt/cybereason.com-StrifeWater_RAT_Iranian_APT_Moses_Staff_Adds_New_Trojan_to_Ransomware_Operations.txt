The cybersecurity firm Cybereason uncovered a new remote access trojan (RAT) called StrifeWater used by the Iranian state-sponsored hacker group Moses Staff. Moses Staff has been actively targeting organizations in Israel, Italy, India, Germany, Chile, Turkey, UAE, and the US across sectors like government, finance, energy, and manufacturing. The group is politically motivated and aims to steal sensitive data and deploy ransomware to cause disruption. StrifeWater is used in the initial stages of an attack and has the ability to remove itself from the system to cover the attackers' tracks. Analysis shows StrifeWater is used in the early infection stage to gain persistence and reconnoiter the victim's environment. It can execute commands, capture screenshots, download modules, and create scheduled tasks for persistence. StrifeWater communicates with a C2 server at a hardcoded IP address. The C2 commands are encrypted. The RAT profiles the infected host and sends the info to the C2 server. The RAT possesses various capabilities such as command execution, screen capturing, and the ability to download additional extensions. Later in the attack, Moses Staff deploys ransomware after exfiltrating data. This is believed to cover up the espionage and cause damage. StrifeWater is removed and replaced with a normal Windows binary before the ransomware deployment. The discovery of StrifeWater shows Moses Staff is continuing to develop new tools as part of its cyber espionage operations. The group takes measures to avoid detection, which allowed the RAT to stay under the radar until now. Unlike other ransomware groups, the encryption of files in the Moses Staff attacks serves two purposes: inflicting damages by disrupting critical business operations and covering the attackers' tracks. Overall, the report profiles the capabilities of a new stealthy Iranian RAT and its role in the attack chain of a sophisticated, politically motivated threat actor targeting multiple countries.
