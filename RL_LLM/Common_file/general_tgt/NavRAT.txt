The PDF describes a new malicious Hangul Word Processor (HWP) document that Talos discovered targeting Korean users. The document contains an Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) object designed to execute malicious shellcode that downloads and installs a remote access trojan called NavRAT. NavRAT has capabilities including command execution, keylogging, uploading and downloading files. It uses the Naver email platform for command and control by sending uploaded files via email and retrieving downloaded files from email attachments. The malware logs its actions verbosely, which aided analysis. The initial infection starts with a spear-phishing email containing the malicious HWP document titled "Prospects for US-North Korea Summit" referencing the potential June 12 summit. When opened, the EPS object executes shellcode that decodes and downloads the NavRAT payload from a compromised website. NavRAT copies itself to run at startup and injects itself into Internet Explorer processes for stealth. It registers keystrokes and communicates with the attacker via the hardcoded Naver email account. However, Naver has locked the account due to suspicious logins from many countries. Talos assesses with medium confidence that NavRAT and the attack are linked to Group123 based on TTP similarities with previous campaigns. The use of local platforms like Naver for command and control blends malicious traffic with legitimate traffic. The PDF provides IoCs, recommendations for detection, and notes that South Korea remains an attractive target for advanced threats due to geopolitical interests around North Korea. NavRAT shows attackers continually refine tactics to avoid detection.
