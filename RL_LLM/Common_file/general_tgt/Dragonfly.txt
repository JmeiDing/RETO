Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF: The report from Symantec details cyberattacks by an advanced threat group called Dragony targeting organizations in the energy sector in Europe and North America. Dragony has been active since at least 2011 but went quiet for a period before re-emerging in late 2015. The group uses various techniques to compromise targets, including phishing emails, watering hole attacks, and trojanized software. Their goal appears to be intelligence gathering to enable potential sabotage of operational systems. Symantec has identified Trojans like Heriplor and Karagany exclusively used by Dragony. After compromising systems, Dragony will install backdoors to maintain access. They have been observed capturing screenshots, some of which appear to show control systems in energy facilities. This suggests the group may be gathering intelligence on how to manipulate these operational systems. While the origins of Dragony are unclear, some of their tactics like use of Russian strings suggest they may be covering their tracks. Symantec assesses the group is highly capable and experienced, posing a serious threat to the energy sector. Their renewed activity over the past two years indicates they are still actively pursuing their objectives. Symantec recommends mitigation measures like strong passwords, principle of least privilege, and security technologies to detect Dragony's tools and block their activities. They conclude that Dragony has moved beyond initial access and has the capability to cause disruptive and destructive effects.
