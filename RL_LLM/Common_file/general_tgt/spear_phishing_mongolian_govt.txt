The PDF describes a sophisticated spear phishing campaign targeting individuals within the Mongolian government. The attackers sent emails containing Word documents that appeared to contain instructions for logging into webmail or information about a state law proposal. When targets enabled macros in the documents, it triggered a multi-stage attack that ultimately installed the Poison Ivy remote access trojan (RAT) on the system. The attack utilized several techniques to evade detection and make analysis difficult, including: - Bypassing application whitelisting using the regsvr32.exe technique to execute a malicious Windows Script Component file. - Avoiding writing payloads to disk by using multiple stages of obfuscated PowerShell scripts stored in the registry. - Launching a decoy Word document downloaded from the internet to distract the user and hide the malicious activity. - Using the publicly available Inject-LocalShellcode PowerShell script to inject shellcode that decrypts and installs Poison Ivy into the userinit.exe process for persistence. The malicious payload was spread across multiple PowerShell scripts, making its execution difficult to trace. Rather than being written to disk as individual script files, the PowerShell payloads were stored in the registry. The Poison Ivy configuration showed it was set up for keylogging, screen capture, password theft, and other typical RAT functions. While Poison Ivy has been around for years, this attack demonstrated recent publicly available techniques to deliver it in a stealthy manner and avoid detection. The report concludes that behavior-based solutions like FireEye HX can detect this threat by identifying the malicious macro and PowerShell activities, despite the efforts to hide the attack.
