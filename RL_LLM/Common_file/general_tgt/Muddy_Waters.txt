The PDF describes new findings on the threat actor group MuddyWater, which has been actively targeting organizations in Middle Eastern and Asian countries since at least 2017. The group continues to evolve its tactics, using new tools and payloads in 2019 campaigns. They have deployed various backdoors including POWERSTATS, CLOUDSTATS, SHARPSTATS, and DELPHSTATS. Some campaigns also used false flags to misattribute attacks to certain countries. Connections were found between MuddyWater and four Android malware variants, suggesting mobile users may also be targets. The malware has capabilities to steal data and spread itself via SMS. Potential target countries based on indicators include Turkey, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. In April 2019, details on MuddyWater's operations were leaked online. Trend Micro's monitoring revealed evidence corroborating some aspects of the leaks. The leaks contained images of the group's command and control infrastructure, source code, and past victim lists. MuddyWater uses direct IP addresses and a few domain names for command and control. Compromised WordPress sites have been used as proxies. Targets are mostly government entities in the Middle East and Asia, especially in finance, education, foreign affairs, defense, and telecom sectors. While MuddyWater does not seem to have access to zero-days, they have still compromised many targets through continuously evolving infection vectors, especially via email. Organizations should use strong email security and educate employees on email threats.
