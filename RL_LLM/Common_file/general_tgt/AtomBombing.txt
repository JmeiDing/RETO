AtomBombing is a new code injection technique that exploits Windows atom tables to inject malicious code into legitimate processes. It allows bypassing of security products like AV and firewalls by injecting into whitelisted processes and leveraging their permissions. Atom tables allow sharing data between applications. Malicious code can be written to a table and executed by manipulating a legitimate program. AtomBombing provides advantages like accessing user context data and screenshots, performing MITB attacks, and getting around process restrictions. Since it uses legitimate Windows mechanisms, it cannot be patched. Direct monitoring of API calls involved is needed for mitigation. AtomBombing is a new technique that bypasses most current endpoint security solutions focused on preventing initial compromise.
