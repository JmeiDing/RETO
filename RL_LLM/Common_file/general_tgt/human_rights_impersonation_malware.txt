The PDF describes a series of spearphishing campaigns targeting human rights organizations, bloggers, and foreign policy institutions. The campaigns were conducted by an Iranian state-sponsored hacking group in July-August 2016. The group impersonated human rights organizations and activists, sending emails with malware from fake accounts. The malware included Windows and Android remote access tools disguised as legitimate software like TeamSpeak and Telegram. An info-stealing Windows malware called Strealer was used to harvest credentials and data. Analysis of the command infrastructure revealed around 90 identifiable victims, with more breached via stolen credentials. Victims included Iranian dissidents as well as targets in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Palestine aligned with Iranian security interests. The researchers engaged with the hackers through a honeypot, tracing activity to an IP address in Iran. The technical sophistication was higher than typical Iranian campaigns. The tools, tactics, and infrastructure indicate alignment with state interests but attribution remains unclear. The social engineering, malware, and infrastructure show overlaps with other known campaigns like Rocket Kitten, but appear to be a distinct effort. The broad targeting beyond just Iranian dissidents is notable, demonstrating expanded interests. The report provides indicators of compromise to help organizations detect and defend against the malware and infrastructure. Overall, the PDF provides insights into an Iranian state-linked hacking campaign combining social engineering, custom malware, and credential theft to compromise targets across the Middle East aligned with Iranian security priorities.
