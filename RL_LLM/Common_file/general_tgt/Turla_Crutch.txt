The document analyzes a new backdoor named Crutch used by the Turla APT group. ESET researchers discovered Crutch being used from 2015 to early 2020 against the network of a Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the EU. Crutch was attributed to Turla based on similarities in droppers, RC4 keys, and PDB paths with the known Turla malware Gazer. Turla uses Crutch to exfiltrate documents and files to Dropbox accounts under their control. The backdoor receives commands from the operators via Dropbox to perform reconnaissance, lateral movement, and espionage. Stolen files are staged, compressed, and exfiltrated automatically using the Dropbox API. Analysis of operator activity suggests they are in the UTC+3 time zone. Earlier versions of Crutch relied on a separate drive monitor component to collect files. Version 4 integrated file exfiltration directly into the backdoor. Crutch avoids detection by using legitimate services like Dropbox for C2 and hijacking DLLs of programs like Chrome and Firefox for persistence. The continual evolution of Turla's tools indicates significant resources dedicated to compromising high-value diplomatic targets.
