The document discusses a threat actor named Gorgon APT targeting the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector in India through a phishing campaign delivering malware. Gorgon APT is believed to have connections to Pakistan. The phishing emails contain COVID-19 themed Microsoft Word documents exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability to execute malicious code. The code drops a visual basic script that executes PowerShell code to download additional payloads. The payloads include an injector DLL and the Agent Tesla remote access Trojan (RAT). Agent Tesla is used to steal sensitive information from victims' systems. Technical analysis is provided of the phishing documents, obfuscated scripts, encoded payloads, and injection techniques used to compromise systems and install Agent Tesla. The targeting of MSMEs is notable as they make up a large portion of India's workforce and economy but often have lower security resources. The use of COVID-19 themes shows threat actors exploiting the pandemic. The analysis attributes the campaign to Gorgon APT based on tactics, techniques, and procedures aligning with past Gorgon activity. The threat research team recommends updating systems, using anti-virus solutions, and increased scrutiny of pandemic-themed emails to defend against such attacks. Overall, it reveals an active and evolving threat against an important economic sector in India.
