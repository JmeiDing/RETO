The PDF discusses the malware Raspberry Robin, specifically focusing on its heavily protected DLL backdoor called Roshtyak. Roshtyak employs numerous advanced anti-analysis techniques to avoid detection, including anti-debugger, anti-sandbox, anti-VM, and anti-emulation checks. If any check succeeds in detecting the analysis environment, Roshtyak will terminate itself, crash intentionally, enter an infinite loop, or execute fake adware payload. The fake payload tricks analysts into thinking the malware is harmless. Roshtyak's code is heavily obfuscated through control flow flattening, function activation keys, variable masking, and other techniques. It is packed in up to 14 layers, each serving a specific protective purpose. The obfuscation hinders static analysis. The core functionality of Roshtyak is to establish persistence, escalate privileges, move laterally, and download additional payloads. The malware uses encrypted kernel exploits to escalate privileges, which are decrypted on demand. Roshtyak downloads PsExec on demand from a specific URL and drops it into a temporary directory under a random name. The payload to be executed by PsExec is a self-extracting package created by a tool called IExpress, which is an ancient Windows installer. It profiles victims by collecting system information and exfiltrating it to C2 servers over Tor. The servers can respond with new shellcode for execution. Reverse engineering Roshtyak is very challenging due to the combination of heavy obfuscation and numerous advanced anti-analysis tricks. The PDF aims to help fellow researchers recognize and respond to similar malware tricks, and harden analysis environments against the described evasion techniques.
