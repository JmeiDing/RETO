The report analyzes a recent RTF document used in August 2019 by the RANCOR APT group to target entities in South East Asia. The RTF exploit (CVE-2018-0798) drops a payload that downloads a secondary payload from a command and control server. The lure document pretends to be from the Cambodian government and lists officials, aiming to appear legitimate. Tactics match previous RANCOR campaigns that typically use the DDKONG or PLAINTEE malware families as backdoors. The payload downloads a file named after the victim computer and executes it, also creating scheduled tasks for persistence. The network traffic goes to a domain registered in 2019 that returns a 404 error, indicating targeted victims. Due to the payload not being available, attribution to RANCOR is based on tactics and techniques observed. RANCOR has previously targeted government and political groups in SE Asia as part of cyber espionage campaigns.
