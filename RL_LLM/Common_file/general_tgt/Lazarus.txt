The document analyzes watering hole attacks targeting financial institutions in Poland, Mexico, and Uruguay attributed to the Lazarus cybercrime group. The attacks compromise bank regulatory and financial websites to deliver malware via malicious JavaScript. The initial attack was seen on the Polish Financial Supervision Authority website which directed visitors to download malware. The malware was packed but contained known Lazarus group tools. Additional watering holes were found on financial sites in Mexico and Uruguay. The attacks leveraged Silverlight and Flash exploits from exploit kits to deliver first stage malware that gathers system info. A second stage binary then receives commands from a command and control server. Whitelisted IP ranges show banks from certain countries were targeted. While technical evidence linking Lazarus is unclear, the choice of regulatory and central bank websites fits their previous targeting. The attacks aim to compromise financial networks, but the end goal is unknown. Defensive recommendations include blocking indicators and compromised sites, and patching exploits.
