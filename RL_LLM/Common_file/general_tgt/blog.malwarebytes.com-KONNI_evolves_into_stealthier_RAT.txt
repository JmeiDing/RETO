The PDF describes the evolution of KONNI, a remote access Trojan (RAT) used by the North Korean threat actor group Kimsuky. KONNI has been used in campaigns targeting political institutions in Russia and South Korea for at least 8 years. Researchers have found that KONNI is still actively being developed with new versions exhibiting significant updates focused on making the RAT stealthier and more evasive. KONNI is typically delivered via malicious Office documents that trigger a multistage infection chain to deploy the RAT payload,when opened by the victim, initiates a multistage attack involving tasks like elevating privileges, evading detection, and deploying required files. The final goal of the attack is to install KONNI Rat, which is a .dll file supported by an .ini file. The .dll file contains the functionality of the RAT, while the .ini file contains the address of the first C&C server. New versions no longer support launching via rundll32, only allowing execution as a Windows service. This breaks execution in sandboxes while aligning with current real-world attacks. Strings in the malware binary are now encrypted using AES with the service name as the key, preventing analysis without knowledge of how the sample was run. Similarly, files dropped by KONNI including configuration and data files are encrypted using AES derived from their filenames. Data sent to command and control servers is also encrypted uniquely per file using the timestamp. Some samples use an unknown packer that obfuscates code flow and inserts junk instructions to hinder analysis. These changes allow KONNI to evade detections relying on strings, network signatures, and static analysis. They also prevent analysis of the malware without access to the environment mimicking its actual deployment. The ongoing evolution shows the Kimsuky group continues to actively maintain and improve KONNI as a critical implant for gaining persistence on targeted systems.
