This PDF document is about an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group called APT-C-09. The group has been active since at least July 2018 and has used various methods to evade detection by using encrypted configurations on Github and Feed43. The attacker's tactics include creating XLSM files, leveraging vulnerabilities in MSBuild.exe, and using HTTP/HTTPS protocols to communicate with C2 servers. The attacker also uses a loop thread creation and message receiving mechanism to perform actions based on HTTP responses. The malware collects system information and exfiltrates it before sending it out. The attacker has uploaded files such as screen captures, keylogs, and specific file extensions to the C&C server. The distribution of C2s is mostly located in Ukraine, with two IPs in China. The link to feeds.rapidfeeds.com was mentioned in the XML configuration file, confirming that the group keeps updating its C2 configuration channel.
