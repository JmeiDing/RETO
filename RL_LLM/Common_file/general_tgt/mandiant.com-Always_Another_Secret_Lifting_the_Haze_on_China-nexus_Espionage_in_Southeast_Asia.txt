The PDF describes a cyberespionage campaign called UNC4191 that targeted organizations primarily in Southeast Asia, as well as some in the US, Europe, and Asia Pacific. The threat actor has a suspected China nexus. Initial infection vectored used USB devices. Malicious binaries named USB Drive.exe or Removable Drive.exe were executed by users when plugging in compromised USB drives. The binaries sideloaded and executed the malware MISTCLOAK, DARKDEW, and BLUEHAZE. MISTCLOAK decrypts and executes DARKDEW from an encrypted file on the USB drive. DARKDEW self-replicates by infecting any new USB drives plugged into the compromised system. It steals data from air-gapped systems this way. BLUEHAZE uses a signed binary to sideload itself. It opens a reverse shell to a command and control server using NCAT. Successful compromise allows the threat actor to maintain persistent access and carry out intelligence collection. The campaign appears to have started around September 2021 based on compile timestamps of the malware samples. New detections were created in Managed Defense to identify this activity, enabling rapid response. Indicators of compromise are provided. Mandiant will continue monitoring the campaign and provide updates on changes in TTPs or new tools.
