The document discusses malware campaigns targeting organizations involved with the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Security researchers at McAfee uncovered new malware implants associated with intrusion activity that began in December 2017 with a PowerShell implant delivering basic system information to the attackers. The new implants discovered include: Gold Dragon - Gathers system information and profiles the victim system. It establishes persistence on machines running the Korean word processor Hangul. Brave Prince - Korean-language implant that profiles system config and contents. Exfiltrates data via email and HTTP posts. Ghost419 - Based on Gold Dragon and Brave Prince. Gathers system reconnaissance information. RunningRat - Remote access Trojan that captures keystrokes and exfiltrates them. Contains additional unused functionality. The tactics, techniques, and infrastructure analysis indicates these new implants are part of the same intrusion set that targeted the Olympics with the initial PowerShell implant. The expanded capabilities enable long-term persistence and data exfiltration from victim networks. The implants demonstrate anti-analysis and anti-forensics techniques. The campaign establishes permanent system access exploiting the high profile nature of the Olympics. McAfee assesses with high confidence the activity is part of a nation-state sponsored cyber espionage operation.
