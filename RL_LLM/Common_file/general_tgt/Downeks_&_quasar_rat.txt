Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF: The document analyzes a malware campaign by a threat actor group called Gaza Cybergang that targeted government entities in the Middle East region. The attack used a downloader called Downeks to install a remote access trojan (RAT) called QuasarRAT on victim machines. Initial infection vectors are unknown but Downeks is delivered via document droppers posing as legitimate files. Downeks fetches QuasarRAT from a command and control server and executes it. QuasarRAT is based on an open source RAT but modified by the attackers. QuasarRAT's capabilities include keylogging, screenshot capture, file exfiltration, and command execution. It uses encryption and modifies configs to avoid detection. The RAT checks in with C2 servers specified in hosted Google documents. Analysis of the infrastructure links the attack to the DustySky campaign also attributed to Gaza Cybergang. Downeks and QuasarRAT focus on Hebrew-speaking targets and have ties to the Middle East politically. The attackers demonstrate tradecraft like use of VPN tunnels, typosquatting, and stolen digital certificates. But the report also found vulnerabilities in the QuasarRAT C2 server that could allow access by other attackers. The blended attack shows the increasing sophistication of cybercrime groups in leveraging malware toolkits combined with custom coding. The report provides IOCs and highlights approaches to detect these types of blended threats.
