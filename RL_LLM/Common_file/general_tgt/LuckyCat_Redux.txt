The report provides an analysis of the Luckycat cyberespionage campaign active since at least June 2011. It targeted entities in Japan and India in industries like aerospace, energy, engineering, shipping, and military research, as well as Tibetan activists. The attackers used socially engineered emails with contextually relevant decoy documents that exploited vulnerabilities like CVE-2010-3333 to deliver malware like TROJ_WIMMIE. This malware uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for persistence and connects to command and control (C&C) servers. The campaign infrastructure included free web hosting C&C domains as well as more stable virtual private servers (VPS). Analysis of a malware test by the attackers revealed use of Chinese language tools, proxies, and mailing software. Links were found between Luckycat and other campaigns like ShadowNet, Duojeen, Sparksrv, and Comfoo based on shared infrastructure and malware. Luckycat demonstrates the constant, aggressive attempts of cyberespionage actors to compromise targets over time. Defending against such advanced persistent threat campaigns requires threat intelligence, visibility, education, and data-centric protections.
