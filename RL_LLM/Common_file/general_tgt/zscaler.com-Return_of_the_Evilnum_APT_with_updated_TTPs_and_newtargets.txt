The document describes a new campaign by the Evilnum APT group targeting organizations in the UK and Europe. The group has previously targeted financial services companies but recently expanded to target an intergovernmental organization involved in migration services, coinciding with the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The initial attack vector is a spear phishing email with a malicious Word document. The document uses template injection to fetch a macro that executes obfuscated JavaScript. The JavaScript decrypts and drops a loader executable that configures persistence via a scheduled task. The loader executes an encrypted payload that contains the main backdoor. The backdoor decrypts configuration data with C2 domains, user agents, paths, and libraries to resolve. It builds an encrypted data string to exfiltrate system info and communicates with the C2. The backdoor can download additional modules or take a system snapshot. The malware uses several techniques to evade detection, including VBA stomping in the macro, extensive obfuscation in the JavaScript, custom headers and encryption in the payload, and Heaven's Gate to call APIs. The report provides indicators of compromise including file hashes, domains, URI paths, and other runtime strings. It also includes the decryption logic to analyze the network communications. This new campaign demonstrates the group's continued efforts to refine their tactics and target new verticals.
