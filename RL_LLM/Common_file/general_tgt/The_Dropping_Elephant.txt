The PDF describes research and analysis conducted by Kaspersky Lab on a threat actor group named Dropping Elephant, also known as Chinastrats and Patchwork. The key points are: - Dropping Elephant targets high-profile diplomatic and economic organizations related to China's foreign relations. They use spear phishing and watering hole attacks. - Two main infection vectors are used. One sends a document that phones home when opened, followed by an exploit document to install malware. The other uses a website that requires downloading a document to see full articles, which contains an exploit. - The malware is an AutoIT backdoor that downloads additional components. It steals documents and data like Chrome credentials. - Infrastructure analysis revealed the campaign has been ongoing since at least November 2015. Most victims were in Asia with a focus on Chinese interests. - The group reuses some publicly available tools but combines them effectively with social engineering for successful attacks against high-value targets. - The malware artifacts are not technically advanced, using basic exploits, powershell scripts, and open source tools. Keeping software patched prevents much of the malware. - Attribution analysis tied the group to a threat actor using the alias "Aleksandr Sirofimov" which has been linked to previous cybercrime campaigns since 2015. The group may originate from Eastern Europe. In summary, Dropping Elephant is a relatively new but active threat group that has been successfully targeting organizations related to China's foreign relations through simple but cleverly social engineered attacks.
