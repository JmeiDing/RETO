The PDF is a report by Positive Technologies describing the activities of a new hacker group they are calling Space Pirates. The group has Asian roots and has been active since at least 2017, targeting organizations in Russia, Georgia, and Mongolia, including government agencies and companies in aerospace, power, and financial services. The group uses phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to deliver custom malware like MyKLoadClient, Zupdax, BH_A006, and Deed RAT. These malware families have not been publicly described before. The group abuses collaboration platforms like Discord and Slack to distribute malware and for command and control. Their malware uses various encryption algorithms and techniques for hiding its presence and stealing credentials. The group's tools include the Royal Road RTF builder and the PcShare backdoor, and they have been observed using Tmanger and Zupdax during attacks. The report analyzes the functionality of the group's custom malware, including how the malware gains persistence, collects system info, communicates with command servers, and implements encryption. Connections are made between this malware and other known malware like PlugX, ShadowPad, and Poison Ivy, suggesting potential sharing of tools between hacker groups. In addition to custom malware, the group uses living-off-the-land tools like atexec.py and legitimate admin tools to move laterally and collect data from compromised networks. The report also examines the infrastructure used by the group, including IP addresses, domains, and dynamic DNS techniques. Overall, the report provides a comprehensive look at the tools, techniques, infrastructure, and connections of a newly identified group targeting organizations in multiple countries, with a focus on Russian aerospace companies.
