The report discloses an ongoing sophisticated cyberattack campaign targeting biomanufacturing facilities and the bioeconomy. The attackers use a metamorphic malware variant of the SmokeLoader family called Tardigrade to establish persistence and carry out cyberespionage. Tardigrade has a high level of autonomy and sophistication not previously seen targeting this sector. It can recompile itself to avoid detection and has multiple capabilities including credential theft, lateral movement, data exfiltration, and ransomware delivery. The malware has impacted companies related to COVID-19 vaccine development and manufacturing. The attacks likely aim to steal intellectual property and proprietary information. They initially breach networks through phishing and then patiently lurk while escalating privileges. The malware spreads through removable media, shared folders, and by exporting malicious DLLs. Once entrenched, the hackers can manipulate, encrypt, or destroy data. Recommendations include segmenting networks, identifying critical assets, testing backups, and accelerating legacy system upgrades. Awareness, antivirus software, staff training, and reviewing social media exposure can help mitigate the threat. This disclosure aims to alert the bioeconomy sector to bolster cyber defenses against the ongoing attacks.
