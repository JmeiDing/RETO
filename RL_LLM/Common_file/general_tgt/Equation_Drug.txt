Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF: - The PDF describes a sophisticated malware platform called EquationDrug used by the advanced threat actor Equation Group. - EquationDrug is a full cyberespionage platform with a framework to deploy modules for specific surveillance activities. It has kernel-mode drivers, user-mode loaders, orchestrator, plugins, and custom encrypted storage. - The platform includes drivers for persistence, traffic interception, rootkit functionality, packet filtering, and code injection. User-mode components handle command and control, encryption, data collection, compression, etc. - Plugins facilitate functions like keylogging, browser monitoring, file/data collection, reverse DNS lookups, etc. The platform is modular and extensible through plugins assigned unique IDs. - EquationDrug components use various encryption schemes like RC5, RSA for obfuscation. Strings are encrypted with simple XOR or alphabet cipher. - Link timestamp analysis of samples suggests the developers are English speakers in UTC-3 or UTC-4 timezones. Strings also contain apparent English names and codepage. - Configuration data reveals victim-specific customization, with implant build timestamps, version info, C2 domains, and victim IDs stored encrypted. - The report analyses various collected platform components in detail - their purpose, capabilities, IOCs,Working dates, etc. - EquationDrug demonstrates the trend of advanced threat groups evolving their malware from basic tools to sophisticated, modular platforms for long-term intrusion with custom plugins tailored to individual targets.
