The document details the activities of a sophisticated hacking group called Wild Neutron (also known as Jripbot and Morpho). Active since 2011, Wild Neutron has conducted cyber espionage campaigns targeting high-profile companies, likely for economic reasons rather than being a nation-state actor. Wild Neutron first gained attention in 2013 when it infected major tech companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Apple using a Java zero-day exploit and watering hole attacks. After lying low in 2014, Wild Neutron resumed attacks in 2015, compromising law firms, bitcoin companies, healthcare organizations, and others in at least 11 countries. The group uses exploits, custom malware, and an arsenal of hacking tools. A 2015 campaign utilized a stolen digital certificate from Acer and an unknown Flash exploit. Wild Neutron malware includes backdoors, credential harvesters, SSH tunnels, and lateral movement tools. Much malware is based on open source code and leaked tools. Distinctive aspects of Wild Neutron include using UNIX tools ported to Windows, heavy use of SSH for exfiltration, and advanced techniques to hide C&C servers. While not a nation-state actor, Wild Neutron has sophisticated capabilities and continues to evolve its tactics. Its targeting of tech giants in 2013 and unusual victimology point to a flexible, economic motivation. Wild Neutron remains an active and unusual threat actor engaged in likely corporate cyber espionage.
