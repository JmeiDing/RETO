The report details three clusters of intrusions by Chinese threat actors targeting telecommunications companies in Southeast Asia from 2018-2021. Cluster A is attributed to the Soft Cell group which has been active since at least 2018. They gained access by exploiting Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities and used tools like China Chopper, PcShare, Mimikatz, and Cobalt Strike to conduct reconnaissance, harvest credentials, move laterally, and exfiltrate data. They were very evasive and continuously adapted their TTPs in response to mitigations. Cluster B emerged in late 2020 and is suspected to be the work of the Naikon APT group. They used the Nebulae backdoor, ProcDump, Mimikatz, and a custom keylogger called EnrollLogger to maintain access, harvest credentials, and exfiltrate data. Cluster C dates back to 2017 and deployed a custom OWA backdoor on Exchange and IIS servers to steal login credentials. This backdoor shares similarities with previous tools used by Group-3390/APT27. The three clusters targeted the same victims and infrastructure, and in some cases were even on the same endpoints. The overlaps suggest collaboration between groups or separate groups piggybacking off each other's access. All three clusters point to Chinese threat actors conducting espionage against telecoms likely to facilitate surveillance of high-value targets.
