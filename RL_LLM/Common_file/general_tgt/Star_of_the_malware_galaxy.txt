The document analyzes a sophisticated cyberespionage group called the Equation Group that has been active since at least 2001. The group uses highly advanced malware and exploits, including two zero-day exploits later seen in Stuxnet. Their malware includes programs like EQUATIONLASER, EQUATIONDRUG, DOUBLEFANTASY, FANNY, and GRAYFISH which have complex encryption schemes. One exploit called GROK can reprogram hard drive firmware from over a dozen brands to create hidden storage partitions. The malware uses innovative command and control mechanisms including USB-based C2 to exfiltrate data from air-gapped systems. The report provides indicators of compromise like sample MD5 hashes, C2 domains, YARA rules, and programmer usernames found in the code. The level of sophistication implies the Equation Group has vast resources and likely state sponsorship. Their arsenal surpasses other advanced groups like the Stuxnet and Flame authors, suggesting the Equation Group is one of the most capable cyberespionage actors in the world. The report aims to bring attention to their tactics to help security researchers and vendors improve defenses against such advanced threats.
