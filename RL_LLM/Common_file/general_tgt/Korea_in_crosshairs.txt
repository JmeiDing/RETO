This Talos blog post analyzes campaigns conducted by a threat actor group dubbed Group 123 that primarily targets South Korea. The campaigns took place over 2017 and early 2018, with 6 identified: "Golden Time", "Evil New Year", "Are You Happy?", "FreeMilk", "North Korean Human Rights", and "Evil New Year 2018." The campaigns involved spear phishing emails with Korean-language malicious documents that exploit Hangul software vulnerabilities to install remote access Trojans (ROKRAT). The "FreeMilk" campaign differed by targeting financial institutions with Office documents exploiting CVE-2017-0199 instead. Two other malware families were also observed: PoohMilk and Freenki. There is code reuse and shared compiler artifacts between the campaigns, linking them to Group 123. The PDB file naming patterns are highly similar, and the reconnaissance phase code and browser credential stealing functionality is copied between the ROKRAT variants. Group 123 also makes use of compromised legitimate websites and cloud platforms for command and control. In 2018, Group 123 updated ROKRAT to be fileless and leverage process injection. They continue to evolve, adding anti-analysis and anti-sandbox techniques. While mainly South Korea focused, international targets are attacked by replacing Hangul documents with Office. Group 123 has demonstrated mature capabilities tailored to Korean targets and continues to operate actively. Indicators of compromise and MITRE ATT&CK mapping are provided.
