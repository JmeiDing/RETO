The PDF discusses attacks exploiting the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability in Microsoft Office. This vulnerability affects Office 2007, 2010, 2013 and 2013 RT and enables attackers to execute arbitrary code using a specially crafted EPS image file. The exploit uses PostScript and can evade Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP) protection methods. The vulnerability was discovered in 2015 and exploited by several threat actors targeting organizations in Asia: - The Platinum group exploited it in August 2015 in attacks against India. This is believed to be the first in-the-wild use. - In November-December 2015, the APT16 group exploited it in attacks against Taiwan. - In December 2015, the EvilPost group used it in attacks against the Japanese defense sector. - In February-March 2016, the previously unknown Danti group exploited it in attacks against Indian government organizations. Danti may be related to the NetTraveller and DragonOK groups. - Other actors exploiting it include cybercriminals targeting financial institutions in Asia. The threat actors use the exploit in spear-phishing emails with Office doc attachments. The attachments contain EPS files that trigger the vulnerability and execute shellcode to install malware. Each group uses its own malware tools, with varying levels of sophistication. Danti has an extensive arsenal comparable to Platinum. The groups seem focused on targets in Asia and have not been seen attacking Europe/US. Microsoft patched the vulnerability in September 2015 but incidents have continued. The threat actors modify the exploit to bypass antivirus detections. Continued monitoring of attacks using this exploit is recommended.
