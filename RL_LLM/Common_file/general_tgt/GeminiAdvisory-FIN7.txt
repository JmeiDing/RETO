The cybercrime group FIN7 has been using "BadUSB" attacks to spread malware. They distribute USB devices containing malicious Arduino sketches that act as keyboards. When plugged in, the sketch executes PowerShell to download and install the IceBot remote access trojan (RAT). This allows FIN7 to gain unauthorized access to target networks. Analysis of the sketch code shows it opens a hidden PowerShell window to download the trojan from IP addresses linked to FIN7. The RAT then connects to FIN7 command and control servers. A control panel was discovered showing systems infected with IceBot, including info like IP, OS, antivirus, and options to interact with the RAT. This attack method avoids firewalls and email filters by not transmitting malware over the network. Encoding and scripts minimize malware files for stealth. FIN7 recently created a fake security company potentially to construct trojanized USBs. They may be using unwitting admins or sending them to clients for social engineering. The USB-based attack represents an evolution in tactics for FIN7 to gain persistent access and evade protections as they expand into ransomware operations. Defenses should focus on physical media controls and monitoring for suspicious USB activities.
