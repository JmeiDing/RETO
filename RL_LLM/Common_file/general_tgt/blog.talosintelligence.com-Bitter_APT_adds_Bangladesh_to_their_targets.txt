The blog post details a spear-phishing campaign targeted at Bangladesh government organizations that Cisco Talos researchers attribute to the Bitter APT group with moderate confidence. Bitter has previously targeted South Asian government entities but this campaign signals an expansion into Bangladesh. The spear-phishing emails contain either a malicious RTF document or Excel spreadsheet as an attachment. When opened, these documents exploit known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office to download and install a new Bitter trojan called ZxxZ. ZxxZ gathers system info and can download and execute additional files sent from the command and control server. The infrastructure analysis shows similarities between this campaign's C2 and previous Bitter campaigns. The phishing emails originate from and spoof legitimate Pakistani government organizations. The emails contain thematic lures relevant to the target organization's work. Bitter is mainly motivated by espionage and known to exploit vulnerabilities in victims' environments. They are known to target both mobile and desktop platforms and their arsenal mainly contains Bitter RAT, Artra downloader, SlideRAT and AndroRAT. The actor's infrastructure consists of the C2 server (helpdesk[.]autodefragapp[.]com) and several domains that host the adversary's malware. The post analyzes the infection chain, documents, malware, and C2 communication in detail. It covers detections, protections, and IOCs available to defend against this threat. The researchers conclude organizations should implement layered security and be vigilant about targeted attacks in their region from motivated adversaries like Bitter.
