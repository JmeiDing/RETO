The report describes a forensic investigation of a targeted attack on a financial institution in 2018 attributed to the Carbanak cybercriminal group. They used various techniques such as spear-phishing emails, exploiting Microsoft Word, and downloading additional scripts. The group also used a backdoor to establish persistence in the infrastructure. They compromised multiple endpoints and gathered data, including sensitive documents related to internal applications and procedures. The initial infection vector was spear-phishing emails containing malicious documents that downloaded a Cobalt Strike beacon. The timeline shows the attackers spent weeks mapping the internal network, procedures, and applications before attempting to access the ATM network. The attackers followed a careful plan, limiting their footprint and activity primarily to non-business hours to avoid detection. The investigation revealed tactics, tools, and objectives consistent with prior attacks by the Carbanak group against financial organizations.
