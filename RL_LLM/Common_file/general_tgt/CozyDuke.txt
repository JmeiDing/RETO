The whitepaper provides an overview of the CozyDuke malware toolset used in targeted cyberattacks against high-profile organizations like governments. CozyDuke is an uninteresting PDF that has been observed to contain a Flash video of monkeys as the decoy. CozyDuke has been under active development since at least 2011 and consists of components for infecting systems, maintaining persistence, communicating with command servers, and executing additional modules. Infection starts with phishing emails containing links to compromised sites hosting CozyDuke droppers. The droppers install the main CozyDuke components and an encrypted configuration file on the victim system. The main CozyDuke component is a DLL that handles command and control communication over HTTP/HTTPS to receive tasks. It can load additional modules extending functionality, like password stealing, screenshot capture, etc. It can also drop other malware. CozyDuke establishes persistence by adding itself to autorun registries, registering as a service, or COM hijacking. Encrypted configuration data contains C2 servers and task info. CozyDuke has evolved over time in terms of encryption, storage, and obfuscation of strings and configuration data. It is suspected to be connected to the MiniDuke and OnionDuke malware based on infrastructure overlaps. In summary, the whitepaper provides a technical analysis of the design, capabilities, evolution, and operation of the CozyDuke malware toolset used in targeted attacks against high-value organizations.
