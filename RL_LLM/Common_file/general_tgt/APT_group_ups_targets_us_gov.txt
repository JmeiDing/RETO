This PDF document is about a series of attacks attributed to the APT group UPS or APT3, which leverages newly disclosed vulnerabilities in Flash exploits. The attacks share similarities with previous ones using Flash exploits, and they target websites hosted in Ukraine. The attack used compromised subdomains of a legitimate website to host the Flash exploit file show.swf and secondary payload b.gif. The malicious files contain ActionScript code that attempts to exploit vulnerabilities and execute shellcode to ultimately install a payload. The analysis of these files reveals overlap with one of the two Flash zero-day exploits disclosed following the Hacking Team breach. The most important overlap occurs in the "TryExpl" function within MyClass.as, where the same functions and variables are used to create the use-after-free condition caused during the exploitation of the CVE-2015-5119 vulnerability. Both shellcodes use the exact same algorithm and key values to decrypt the payload from ciphertext to cleartext. These attacks highlight how sophisticated APT groups such as UPS can quickly leverage new vulnerabilities in their attacks, leaving little time for organizations to patch effectively.
