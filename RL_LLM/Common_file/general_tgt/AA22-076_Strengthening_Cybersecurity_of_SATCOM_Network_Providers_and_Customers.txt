The cybersecurity advisory from CISA and FBI notes potential threats to U.S. and international satellite communications (SATCOM) networks. Successful intrusions could create risks for SATCOM customers. The agencies advise SATCOM providers and customers to take several steps: Use secure authentication methods including multifactor authentication where possible. Enforce strong passwords and credential management. Enforce least privilege principles for access control and authorization. Review trust relationships and contractual security provisions with service providers. Implement encryption across SATCOM network communications links. Ensure robust patching, configuration auditing, and vulnerability management. Monitor network logs for suspicious activity like unauthorized logins. Expand monitoring capabilities. Have incident response, resilience, and continuity of operations plans in place. Organizations are advised to report incidents and suspicious activity to CISA and FBI. Threat information will be updated as new details emerge.
