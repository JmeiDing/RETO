The PDF analyzes an attack by the Iranian state-sponsored threat actor APT34 exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 Office vulnerability in November 2017. APT34 sent a spearphishing email containing a malicious RTF document that triggered the vulnerability, executing malware on the victim's system. The initial malware installed a PowerShell-based backdoor, POWRUNER, and a secondary downloader, BONDUPDATER, featuring domain generation algorithm functionality. POWRUNER connects to a command and control server to receive commands, exfiltrate data, and take screenshots from the compromised host. BONDUPDATER generates algorithmic subdomains for secondary C2 channels. The report provides indicators of compromise associated with the attack infrastructure and malware. It also highlights APT34's rapid incorporation of recently patched vulnerabilities into their operations. The group has targeted Middle Eastern government, financial, energy and telecom entities since at least 2014. The new attack shows APT34's continuing efforts to improve their toolset despite public exposure of their activities. Overall, the PDF provides valuable insights into APT34's tactics, techniques and procedures, showcasing their blend of custom malware, Living off the Land techniques, and technical agility in exploiting the latest vulnerabilities for cyber espionage. The report emphasizes the importance of rapid mitigation for nation-state groups able to quickly weaponize public proof-of-concept exploit code.
