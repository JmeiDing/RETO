Trend Micro discovered an ongoing campaign targeting the Middle East and North Africa distributing the NjRAT malware using geopolitical themes as lures. The attack starts with a malicious CAB file containing an obfuscated VBS script. The VBS fetches a PowerShell payload from a compromised domain that injects NjRAT into the aspnet_compiler process. NjRAT provides unauthorized remote access to infected systems for data theft, screenshots, reverse shells, etc. The lures in filenames and promotions leverage regional political and military references to entice targets to open the files. Cloud storage services host the malware. The campaign has been active since at least mid-2022, distributing via social media and phishing emails. The threat actor creates fake accounts to spread the lures. Compromised Libyan government sites are utilized to host the next stage payload. NjRATpersistence is achieved by adding folders to the startup keys. Organizations are advised to train users against opening suspicious files from public sources, block malicious URLs, and account for regional instability in security strategies. Indicators of compromise and technical analysis of the full infection chain are provided to support detection and mitigation of the campaign.
