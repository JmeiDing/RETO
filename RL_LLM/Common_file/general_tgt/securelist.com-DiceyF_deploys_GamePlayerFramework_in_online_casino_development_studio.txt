The report analyzes cyberespionage activity by an APT group called DiceyF targeting online casinos and gaming companies in Southeast Asia. DiceyF uses phishing and malware to infiltrate networks and exfiltrate data. The initial infection involves weaponized Office documents that drop a multi-stage malware framework named GamePlayerFramework. There are at least two branches of the framework: Tifa and Yuna, each with its own set of modules and downloaders. This .NET malware features downloaders, orchestrators, and plugins for surveillance. The plugins steal keystrokes, clipboard data, screenshots, and credentials. GamePlayerFramework is an evolution of past malware like PuppetLoader used by DiceyF. The group continuously modifies the code, adding encryption and logging. The malware is signed with a stolen digital certificate to appear legitimate. Infrastructure analysis uncovered domains and IP addresses used for command and control. DiceyF registered lookalike domains imitating messaging apps and other software used by targets. Attribution is difficult, but tactics overlap with previous activity tracked as LuckyStar, Earth Berberoka, and GamblingPuppet. The targeting of online gaming suggests cyber espionage for intellectual property theft over financial crime. The report provides technical details on the infection routines, command and control, infrastructure, malware capabilities, and attribution. Comprehensive indicators of compromise are included. Defenders should focus on detecting Delivery documents, monitoring software deployment systems, and looking for the use of living-off-the-land binaries and stolen certificates. Gaming companies should confirm security controls and perform threat hunting to uncover DiceyF intrusions.
