The cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks has uncovered a new malware campaign dubbed "MiniDionis" from the threat actor group CozyDuke (also known as CozyCar). The campaign targets government organizations and think tanks in democratic countries and began on July 7, 2015. The initial infection vector is via spear phishing emails containing weaponized attachments. When opened, the attachments drop a decoy media file to trick the user as well as a downloader which retrieves the main payload disguised as a Flash file. The payload is decoded and dropped onto the system, named to emulate legitimate software. The malware, called "miniDionis" internally by the attackers, shares code similarities with the "Seaduke" malware described in previous research. It stores configuration data in memory and beacons to C2 servers over HTTPS using encrypted cookie data for commands. Available commands allow the threat actors full remote control, including uploading/downloading files, executing commands, and exfiltrating system data. The report concludes that the actors behind CozyDuke are highly advanced and motivated. Palo Alto recommends security teams review the indicators of compromise provided and implement controls to detect and prevent future attacks. User education is also critical against spear phishing. Customers using Palo Alto's WildFire technology were protected against this new campaign.
