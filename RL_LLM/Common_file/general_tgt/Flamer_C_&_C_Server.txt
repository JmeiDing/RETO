This PDF analyzes two command and control servers used to manage the Flamer malware campaign targeting the Middle East. Key points: Flamer is a sophisticated cyberespionage tool that spread via a Windows Update man-in-the-middle attack. Symantec analyzed two C&C servers from 2012. The servers were set up to minimize logging and remove data to avoid discovery. But some files remained that revealed details like operator nicknames, targeted countries, and timestamps of activity. The custom Newsforyou web app on the servers supported Flamer and other unknown malware. It encrypted data to prevent inspection if compromised. Newsforyou was developed over years by at least 4 authors. It separates roles so operators may not know what data they handle. The servers distributed payload modules to infected machines. One payload ordered Flamer to delete itself in late May 2012. 189 stolen data files from Israel and other Middle East countries were logged before deletion. 5.7GB of stolen data was found on one server. The operation's sophistication, ongoing development since 2006, and data theft volumes point to a well-resourced, likely state-sponsored threat actor.
