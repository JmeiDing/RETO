Russian military intelligence GRU Unit 26165 conducts on-site cyber operations abroad in addition to remote hacking. In 2018, four GRU operatives traveled to the Netherlands to hack the OPCW investigating the Skripal poisoning. Unit 26165 members have conducted on-site hacks against anti-doping agencies and other targets when remote access fails. The on-site operations may be to disrupt investigations into embarrassing Russian activities or as backup when remote access fails. It is unclear how much direction comes from the Kremlin versus GRU initiative for these on-site hacks. Western governments should monitor and counter not just remote Russian state hacking but also on-site cyber operations.
