This report provides an overview of the financially-motivated cybercrime group APT38, which conducts heists against banks and financial institutions. APT38 targets banks and financial systems to steal large sums of money, likely to raise funds for the North Korean regime. They have targeted over 16 organizations in at least 11 countries since 2014. The authors suggest that APT38 is responsible for a number of high-profile heists, including those targeting financial institutions in the United States. APT38 spends months gathering intel and maintaining access before attempting heists. They also note that APT38 has access to custom development capabilities and has modified their malware to better suit how SWIFT is used in specific organizations. The group has employed multiple techniques for avoiding detection, including use of passive and active backdoors, modular malware, active testing, and agile response to AV. The authors believe that APT38's cyberheists are extensions of North Korea's illicit activities, such as smuggling and drug trade.
