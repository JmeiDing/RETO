The document describes a cyberattack against the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) website that occurred in July 2015. The PCA was hearing a case brought by the Philippines against China regarding territorial disputes in the South China Sea. - In early July 2015, an Adobe Flash exploit was publicly disclosed as part of the Hacking Team data breach. Within 72 hours, this same exploit was used to compromise the PCA website specifically on pages related to the Philippines vs China case. - The exploit was hosted on a domain registered using falsified information pointing to Chinese actors. The malware payload connected back to this domain as well as a related domain registered with a Chinese email address. - The timing and target of this attack suggests it was purposefully carried out by Chinese state-sponsored hackers to monitor those interested in the high-profile legal case, despite China's public refusal to participate in the case. - The attack highlights how cyberattacks can be used for espionage and surveillance related to geopolitical disputes. It also demonstrates the difference between threat data and analyzed threat intelligence. - The security company ThreatConnect analyzed the technical details of the attack and shared their findings through their threat intelligence platform. The report concludes the attack was likely an effort by China to secretly spy on the court case they publicly dismiss.
