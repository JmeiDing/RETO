The report documents a cyberespionage network called the Shadow network that compromised government, business, and academic systems primarily in India but also internationally. The attackers used social media platforms like Twitter, Google Groups, and blogs to maintain persistent control of compromised computers. They also used spearphishing to target victims with malware hidden in documents exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office and Adobe products. Investigation traced the network back to individuals in Chengdu, China with ties to Chinese hacking forums. The network seems connected to previous cyberespionage campaigns using malware like Enfal or PlugX. Recovered documents show a focus on Indian national security matters and Tibetan exile groups. The report argues this ecosystem of malware networks and cyberespionage continues to grow as a result of inadequate security practices and lack of international norms. It demonstrates potential for collateral compromise across mutually dependent networks. The investigation also faced challenges around victim notification procedures. In summary, the report documents the Shadow cyberespionage network operating out of China to steal sensitive documents from Indian government and Tibetan exile targets. It highlights the complex challenges of attribution, notification, and countering persistent threats in cyberspace.
