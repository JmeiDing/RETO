The PDF analyzes a cyberespionage campaign named VOHO that was identified in mid-2012. The attackers used "watering hole" tactics, compromising legitimate websites likely to be visited by the intended targets in order to redirect visitors to an exploit server hosting malware. The compromised pivot websites were relevant to the Washington DC and Boston areas, political activism, defense contractors, education, and democratic reforms. The exploit server hosted malware exploiting the CVE-2012-1889 and CVE-2012-1723 vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Java respectively. Successful exploits led to installation of a Gh0st RAT on the victims' systems. Gh0st RAT is remote access malware associated with Chinese state-sponsored groups in prior campaigns targeting political dissidents and government entities. In total, over 32,000 hosts were redirected and nearly 4,000 were successfully compromised based on evidence of downloading the exploit malware. The victims spanned over 700 organizations globally, with the most activity seen at corporations, defense contractors, local/federal government, education, financial services, and healthcare entities. The report concludes the campaign was likely conducted by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors based on the tools, infrastructure, and targeting aligning with prior suspected Chinese cyberespionage campaigns. The watering hole tactics reflect sophisticated planning to compromise specific targets of interest through their expected online activities.
