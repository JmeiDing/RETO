The document provides a technical analysis of a novel piece of Chinese malware named "BendyBear" by Palo Alto Networks researchers. BendyBear is a sophisticated shellcode module used as a downloader for cyber espionage operations by the threat actor group BlackTech, which has ties to China. The over 10,000 bytes of shellcode implements anti-analysis techniques and advanced encryption to remain stealthy. It shares many similarities with the WaterBear malware linked to BlackTech. The shellcode's goal is to download a second stage implant from a command and control server. The analysis provides details on how the shellcode executes, decrypts configurations, communicates with the C2 server using a custom encryption scheme, and loads the second stage payload directly in memory. Multiple anti-analysis features are highlighted such as clearing DNS caches, PEB modifications, polymorphic code, and debugger checks. Comparisons are drawn between BendyBear and WaterBear in terms of encryption, payload delivery, signature checks, and evasion capabilities. Indicators of compromise are included for the shellcode samples, C2 domains, and WaterBear loaders identified. The shellcode demonstrates sophisticated coding and attempts to evade detection through its implementation.
