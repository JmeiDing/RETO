The PDF describes Guildma, a prevalent Brazilian banking trojan written in Delphi. Guildma spreads through spam emails containing malicious attachments and has modular architecture consisting of 10 modules. It implements backdoor functionality like screenshotting, keylogging, and downloading additional payloads. Guildma retrieves C&C servers from YouTube channel descriptions encrypted using custom algorithms. It uses innovative techniques for execution and attack, like abusing Windows Explorer, BITSAdmin, and ExtExport. The PDF analyzes the evolution of Guildma's distribution chains, which reuse old techniques and leverage tools already on the system like WMIC, RegSvr32, and CertUtil. The modules are XOR encrypted and some contain stolen credential extraction tools. Recent developments include new string encryption algorithms combining those of other trojans, and social media C&C retrieval. Guildma is constantly updated but has redundant legacy code. It solely targets Brazil and checks for sandbox environments. In summary, Guildma is an advanced, prevalent banking trojan active in Brazil that uses unique techniques for distribution, execution, command and control, and credential theft. It is under active development and continues to evolve its tactics.
