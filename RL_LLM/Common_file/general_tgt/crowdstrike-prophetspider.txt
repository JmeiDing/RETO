The document describes an incident investigated by CrowdStrike where the threat actor group Prophet Spider exploited a remote code execution vulnerability CVE-2021-22941 in Citrix ShareFile to compromise a Microsoft IIS web server. Prophet Spider is an eCrime group that compromises vulnerable web servers for access and to deploy ransomware. The ShareFile vulnerability allows overwriting an existing file via a crafted HTTP request. Prophet Spider sent an HTTP request with a webshell payload to exploit the vulnerability and overwrite a file on the IIS server. This gave them an initial foothold. The group then used the webshell to execute commands like nslookup for connectivity checks, PowerShell commands to download utilities like wget, and attempts to download malware payloads. When malware downloads failed, Prophet Spider attempted to install a public GitHub reverse shell onto the server. The analysis shows Prophet Spider's opportunistic targeting of known vulnerabilities to gain access, as well as their use of webshells and living-off-the-land tools like wget and PowerShell. Indicators of compromise and MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with the group are also outlined. The incident demonstrates Prophet Spider's continued evolution of tactics while exploiting known web application vulnerabilities as an initial access vector.
