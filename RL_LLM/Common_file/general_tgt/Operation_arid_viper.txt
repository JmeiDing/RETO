The research paper details two related malware campaigns targeting victims primarily in Israel and the Middle East - Operation Arid Viper and Operation Advtravel. Operation Arid Viper uses sophisticated malware delivered via spear-phishing to Israeli targets. The emails contain attachments that drop malware that searches the infected system for documents to exfiltrate. The command and control infrastructure is located in Germany but has ties to individuals in Gaza, Palestine based on domain registration details. The targets appear to be government, military, infrastructure, and academic organizations in Israel. Operation Advtravel shares infrastructure with Arid Viper but uses less sophisticated malware and appears to target more general victims in Egypt and the Arab world. The attackers have made mistakes exposing their identities, code, and stolen data. This has revealed individuals like Dev_hima, a member of hacker groups targeting Israel, and control panel user names Khloda, Belal, and Belal2, among others with ties to Gaza. While the two campaigns employ different tactics and malware, their infrastructure links suggest a connection between the threat actors. The evidence points to hacking groups ideologically motivated to target Israel and related interests. The campaigns demonstrate the growing capabilities of pro-Palestine cyber groups intent on attacking their adversaries through cyberspace.
