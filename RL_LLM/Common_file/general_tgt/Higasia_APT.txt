This document analyzes a new malware campaign attributed to the Higaisa APT group. The key points are: Higaisa distributed LNK shortcut files in RAR archives via spear-phishing. The LNK executes a series of commands to drop payloads. The LNK drops a JS script, loader executable, and shellcode. The JS sends system info to the C2 and installs persistence. The loader runs the shellcode. The shellcode resolves APIs, allocates memory, and makes HTTPS requests to the C2 server. The attack uses multiple stages and uncommon techniques like LNK files for obfuscation and evasion. Decoding, decompressing, scripting, loading, and scheduling are employed. IOCs are provided including file hashes, domain names, IP addresses, and identified MITRE ATT&CK techniques. In summary, this document provides an in-depth look at a new campaign by the Higaisa APT group that uses an evasive multi-stage malware delivery technique starting with weaponized LNK files distributed via phishing. Technical analysis of the payloads dropped by the LNK reveal the attack ultimately makes C2 requests to compromise the victim system.
