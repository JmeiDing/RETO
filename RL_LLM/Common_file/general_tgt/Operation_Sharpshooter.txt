The report describes a new malware campaign called Operation Sharpshooter that is targeting nuclear, defense, energy, and financial companies globally. The campaign uses malicious Word documents containing macros that download an implant called Rising Sun. Rising Sun is a modular backdoor that performs reconnaissance and can execute commands on infected systems. The report provides technical analysis of the Rising Sun implant. Key findings: It uses code from the Lazarus Group's 2015 Duuzer backdoor. It shares multiple capabilities and code signatures with Duuzer. It gathers system info like network, OS, username etc and sends it to a command server. It can also execute commands, read files, write files, kill processes etc. It uses obfuscation techniques like encoded strings and RC4 encryption to hide its commands and exfiltrate data. The initial infection is via macro docs claiming fake job postings. The docs have Korean language metadata. The report does not definitively attribute the attack but says it shares TTPs with prior Lazarus Group activity. More info is needed to confirm attribution. Impacted organizations detected so far are predominantly in the US, focused on government, defense and energy sectors. In summary, the report provides technical analysis of a new sophisticated malware campaign targeting sensitive industries globally, including potential links to Lazarus Group. Though attribution is unclear, the attack leverages advanced malware and should be monitored closely.
