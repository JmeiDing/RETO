The PDF discusses methods for detecting web shells through network traffic analysis. Web shells allow attackers remote access to a system. Since web shells generate little traffic when inactive, network detection is important when other methods like file analysis are not possible. Approaches covered: IDS signatures - Known web shell traffic patterns can be written into Snort rules to match on unique header values, cookies, and HTML content. Custom signatures can be created by analyzing packet captures of new web shells. HTTP request analysis - Using a tool like Bro IDS, HTTP requests can be analyzed for anomalies. Stack/sort requests and whitelist known good traffic to identify outliers that could be a web shell. IP address analysis - Track known bad IPs, VPNs/proxies, geographic locations, and internal IPs as potential indicators of web shell traffic. Identify initial compromise - Finding the initial infection vector that allowed the web shell installation makes further detection easier. Log analysis methods can be applied to network traffic. Combining network and host-based detection techniques improves the chances of finding well-hidden web shells. Understanding normal network patterns is key to identifying anomalies that could indicate web shell activity.
