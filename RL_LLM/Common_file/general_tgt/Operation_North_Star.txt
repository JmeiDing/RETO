The PDF describes a cyberespionage campaign called Operation North Star that targeted the aerospace and defense industries starting in early 2020. The attackers sent spear phishing emails with malicious Office documents that contained legitimate job postings from major defense contractors. The documents exploited vulnerabilities to install malware that collected system information from victims. Three different malware families were delivered, including modified SQL Lite DLLs, a Gh0st RAT trojan, and a PoisonIvy RAT. The malware used encrypted C2 communications and mimicked the victim's browser user agent to avoid detection. The report attributes the campaign to the North Korean-linked threat actor Hidden Cobra based on tactics, techniques, and procedures that match previous Hidden Cobra activity targeting the defense industry in 2017 and 2019. Infrastructure analysis uncovered overlaps between the 2020 campaign and prior activity, including compromised servers in Italy and the US hosting command and control. Korean language decoy documents also suggest targeting of South Korean politics. The report concludes that Hidden Cobra continues to leverage the economic situation and interest in the defense industry to hide its cyberespionage operations. Recommendations are provided for security controls like spear phishing training, web proxies, and adaptable endpoint detection to defend against this threat.
