The FBI has released information about an ongoing campaign by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploiting a recently discovered zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2021-44515) in ManageEngine Desktop Central servers. The actors have been observed compromising servers, dropping webshells to bypass authentication, conducting reconnaissance, and attempting lateral movement since at least late October 2021. The vulnerability allows authentication bypass and arbitrary code execution on Desktop Central servers. Zoho has released patches for affected versions. The actors are abusing a legitimate API endpoint (/fos/statuscheck) to execute code as SYSTEM. Initial access involves uploading webshells. The actors then use living-off-the-land binaries like BITSAdmin to download malware, which creates persistent services for command and control. Follow-on actions include credential dumping and lateral movement attempts. The advisory contains indicators of compromise, including suspicious URLs, processes, domains, hashes, and YARA rules. Affected organizations are encouraged to review logs, identify any related activity, patch vulnerable systems, and report compromises to the FBI.
