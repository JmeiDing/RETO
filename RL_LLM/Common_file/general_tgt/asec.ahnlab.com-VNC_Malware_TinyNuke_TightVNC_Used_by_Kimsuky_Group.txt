The PDF document discusses the use of VNC (Virtual Network Computing) and its various malware variants in cyber attacks. The document highlights three main types of VNC malware: TinyNuke, TightVNC, and Kimsuky Group's variant. TinyNuke is a feature-rich VNC software that allows for remote control of infected systems. It uses the "AVE_MARIA" string for verification during communication between the server and client. However, an attacker can potentially gain control by using a modified version of the software called "LIGHT's BOMB." TightVNC is another VNC malware distributed via AppleSeed backdoor. It supports reverse VNC communication, allowing attackers to remotely access and control infected systems without installing a service. Kimsuky Group has customized this malware to distribute it easily. Kimsuky Group's malware trend involves the use of AppleSeed to install Meterpreter, a different backdoor malware. They also use TinyNuke, TightVNC, and RDP Wrapper for screen control. The group has been observed using Mimikatz for account information stealing. Users are advised to be cautious when opening attachments from unknown sources and avoid visiting untrusted websites to protect themselves from these cyber attacks.
