The document analyzes a new remote access trojan (RAT) called JhoneRAT that is targeting Middle Eastern countries. Attackers distribute malicious Office documents that download additional payloads to infect victims with the Python-based JhoneRAT. The malware uses multiple cloud services for command and control, including Google Drive, Twitter, ImgBB, and Google Forms. It gathers system information and can take screenshots, run commands, and download files. JhoneRAT only runs if the victim system has an Arabic keyboard layout, filtering infections to a list of 14 Middle Eastern countries. The malware uses anti-analysis and anti-virtualization techniques to avoid detection. The campaign demonstrates sophisticated tradecraft, with attackers hosting infrastructure purely on reputable cloud platforms. This blends malicious traffic with legitimate user activities. The use of Python and focus on specific regions also aim to maximize effectiveness. The report documents the infection process, capabilities, and command and control methods used by JhoneRAT. It highlights how attackers are increasingly leveraging cloud services and targeted social engineering for campaigns in the Middle East.
