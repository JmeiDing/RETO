The report by Cylance details activity from a Chinese cyberespionage threat actor group that was previously believed to have reduced operations after exposure in 2013. Analysis of a malware sample from 2015 shows the group, referred to as SPEAR, has continued active campaigns against government, defense, and aerospace targets. The initial infection vector involves phishing emails with weaponized Office documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158. An example initial beacon request was provided in base64 encoding with the alphabet "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-_." This can be decoded using RC4 decryption with the first four bytes of the payload as the decryption key. Stages of shellcode decode and install a DLL backdoor for remote access, command execution, data exfiltration, etc. Persistence is achieved via a Run key registry modification. The malware uses DLL side-loading and search order hijacking techniques to hide in plain sight, avoiding detections. It communicates over HTTP or uses Poison Ivy as a backup. The backdoor will look for encrypted commands within HTML comments returned from the C2 using the format "<!­­？*$@COMMAND GOES HERE@$*?­­！>;" However, this was not active at the time of analysis, so confirmation cannot be verified. The backdoor may also make requests to the C2 over HTTP using parameters in the query string such as "query?sid" and "result?sid." The PDB path is left in the backdoor despite no other instances of this path being identified. Several additional exploit documents were identified by investigating the domains "fighthard.mooo.com" and "rampage.freetcp.com." The document includes a Python script that simplifies decoding of the beacon request and decryption of the payload using base64 decoding and rolling XOR encryption. Infrastructure analysis connects the 2015 activity with the SPEAR group's previous operations going back to 2009, showing continued evolution of their tactics. Recommended mitigations include monitoring/blocking dynamic DNS domains, analyzing HTTP headers for anomalies, keeping software patched, and not opening untrusted email attachments. In summary, the report provides technical analysis and supporting infrastructure links to reveal an exposed cyberespionage group's continued activities, now using more advanced malware implants two years later.
