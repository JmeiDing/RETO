The PDF describes an analysis by Palo Alto Networks of recent exploits targeting the InPage word processor program. InPage supports languages like Urdu and is not commonly exploited. Three InPage exploit documents were found delivering three different malwares: CONFUCIUS_B remote access trojan. BioData backdoor. A new backdoor called MY24 The exploits use similar shellcode, suggesting the same actor or shared code. The shellcode employs a custom hashing algorithm to resolve Windows APIs. The decoy documents suggest politically motivated targeting related to India, Kashmir, and terrorism. Technical analysis is provided of the shellcode, dropper, and multi-stage execution flows. The malwares use various obfuscation techniques like XOR encryption and custom substitution ciphers. Network traffic analysis reveals C2 communication and command and control features for data exfiltration, remote shell, and module downloads. The report concludes these are advanced actors with significant resources tailoring InPage exploits and varied malwares for likely state-sponsored espionage. Protection via blocking technical indicators is summarized.
