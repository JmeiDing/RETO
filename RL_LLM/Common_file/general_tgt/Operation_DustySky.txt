The report by ClearSky Security provides an analysis of the cyberespionage campaign Operation DustySky attributed to a threat actor they call Molerats, believed to be linked to Hamas in Gaza. DustySky has been active since at least May 2015, targeting organizations in Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, the US, and Europe with spearphishing using weaponized documents that install custom malware for surveillance. The report reveals details on the group's tactics, including social engineering, evolving custom malware, infrastructure, and post-compromise behavior. Three main malware stages are outlined: initial DustySky dropper, core backdoor, and keylogger components. Communications beacon to C2 servers and exfiltrate data and stolen files. Public RATs are also used following initial access. Attribution to Molerats is based on code reuse, similarities to previous attacks, and originating IPs in Gaza. While not destructive, the report concludes DustySky poses an advanced persistent threat through its ongoing espionage campaigns in the Middle East and beyond. Indicators of compromise and mitigation advice are provided. In summary, the report analyzes the tactics, tools, infrastructure, and attribution of the DustySky campaign conducted by the Molerats threat actor in Gaza to infiltrate regional targets through social engineering and multi-stage malware for intelligence gathering.
