The report provides an overview of Russia's cyberattack activity against Ukraine before and during the 2022 invasion. It is authored by Microsoft's Digital Security Unit based on threat intelligence gathered by Microsoft. Key findings: At least 6 Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have conducted cyber operations against Ukrainian organizations in conjunction with kinetic military action. Operations aim to disrupt government and military functions, critical infrastructure, and public trust. Tactics include spearphishing, exploiting unpatched systems, supply chain compromises, and destructive "wiper" malware. Threat groups targeted sectors relevant to Russian military objectives like government, military, energy, media, nuclear, logistics, and telecoms. Cyber targeting often coincided geographically with kinetic attacks. Russia-aligned groups continuously evolve their malware to evade defenses. Microsoft has provided threat intel to Ukrainian authorities to help protect networks. With the conflict ongoing, threat actors may escalate attacks in Ukraine and conduct retaliatory operations outside Ukraine against supporting nations. Microsoft recommends organizations worldwide improve identity and access management, secure internet-facing assets, enable multi-factor authentication, and prepare incident response plans. The report underscores the major role of cyber operations in Russia's hybrid war against Ukraine. It provides insights into the activities of Russian threat actors and recommendations for improving cyber defenses globally.
