The document analyzes a new variant of the BlackEnergy malware, which is believed to be developed by a nation-state actor and used in cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. BlackEnergy evolved from a simple DDoS malware in 2007 to a sophisticated malware capable of data exfiltration, network traffic monitoring, and lateral movement. This new variant uses a malicious Excel spreadsheet to distribute the malware. The spreadsheet contains a malicious macro that assembles the BlackEnergy executable and executes it. BlackEnergy then drops additional modules, including a network sniffer module that can capture sensitive network traffic. The network sniffer module utilizes the WinPcap library to capture network packets and appears to open a backdoor to exfiltrate data. It gathers system information like keyboard layout and sends it to a command and control server hosted on 5.149.254.114. The author believes this variant has already infected systems across Ukraine and Europe and could lead to blackouts, malfunctions, and disruptions of critical infrastructure. The modular nature of BlackEnergy allows different actors to utilize it in parallel for various objectives. The author concludes that a government is likely involved in developing this malware and using it for cyber warfare operations.
