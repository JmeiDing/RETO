The document analyzes attacks conducted by an Indian advanced persistent threat (APT) group called Confucius. Confucius has been active since at least 2013 and primarily targets Pakistan government and military organizations through spearphishing emails containing malware. Researchers discovered Confucius using new social engineering techniques in its recent attacks, including persuasive phishing emails impersonating government entities and fake document files appearing to be from Pakistani officials. The phishing emails contain links to download malicious macro documents or direct victims to realistic phishing websites cloned from real Pakistani government sites. Once clicked, the links deploy malware like the QuasarRAT trojan or a multi-stage C# malware toolset. Confucius uses stolen credentials, keyloggers, and remote access tools to exfiltrate sensitive documents from the target network. They use obfuscation, timestamp manipulation, and Cloudflare services to evade detection. Confucius shares some tools with another Indian APT called SideWinder, indicating collaboration between different Indian threat groups. The attacks align closely with the group's previous campaigns revealed in 2016 and demonstrate Confucius continues to focus on cyberespionage against the Pakistani government using clever social engineering tactics.
