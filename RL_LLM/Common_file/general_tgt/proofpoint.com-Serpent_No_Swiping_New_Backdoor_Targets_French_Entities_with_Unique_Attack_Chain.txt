The PDF describes a new targeted attack campaign impacting French entities in construction, real estate, and government. The threat actor uses phishing emails with GDPR-themed lures to distribute macro-enabled Word docs. The macros contain ASCII snake art and reach out to download an image file hidden with a PowerShell script using steganography. The PowerShell script installs the open source Chocolatey package manager, then Python and dependencies. It fetches another image file with a Python backdoor script nicknamed Serpent, also hidden via steganography. The Serpent backdoor periodically checks a command and control server hosted on Tor. It can run any Windows command provided by the attacker and send the output to the command server via a proxy pastebin service. In addition, the threat actor demonstrated using Windows scheduled tasks proxy execution to bypass detection. Other payloads were found using the Chocolatey installer. The unique use of the Chocolatey installer, steganography, the Serpent backdoor, and the scheduled task technique suggest this is an advanced persistent threat actor whose objectives are currently unknown. The campaign targeted a small number of French entities across construction, real estate and government sectors. Proofpoint provides indicators of compromise like script URLs, sender emails, and document hashes to detect activity from this new threat. The ultimate goals of the threat actor are not yet determined.
