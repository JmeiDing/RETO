Here is a summary of the key points from the DMSniff POS malware analysis PDF: DMSniff is a point-of-sale (POS) malware that has been actively used since at least 2016 to target small and medium-sized businesses, especially in the restaurant and entertainment industries. It scrapes credit card track data from POS systems before it is encrypted and sent to payment processors. The malware uses simple string encoding to obfuscate its capabilities and evade detection. It also implements a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to rapidly generate lists of command-and-control domains, making it resilient to takedowns. The DGA algorithm is based on hardcoded values unique to each malware sample. DMSniff first gains an initial foothold on POS devices through brute force SSH attacks or by exploiting vulnerabilities. Once installed, it scans through running processes and memory to identify and extract credit card numbers. The track data is exfiltrated to the attacker's infrastructure. The command and control panel is written in PHP and allows the attacker to view stolen credit card data. The data is deleted from the panel after the attacker downloads the reports, indicating it is being stored elsewhere for sale or further abuse. Researchers decoded strings from the malware samples, which revealed its capabilities for data theft, command execution, and communication with the command server. Possible mitigations include updating POS devices, monitoring for brute forcing attempts, and watching for suspicious process executions indicative of malware. DMSniff exemplifies the ongoing evolution of POS malware targeting vulnerable systems in the retail and hospitality industries. Its covert string encoding and domain generation algorithm make it more advanced than typical POS malware.
