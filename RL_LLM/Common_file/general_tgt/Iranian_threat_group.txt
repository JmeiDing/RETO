The PDF describes cyberattacks by an Iranian threat group called TEMP.Zagros or MuddyWater that targeted organizations in Asia and the Middle East from January to March 2018. The attacks distributed macro-enabled documents purporting to be from Pakistani, Turkish, Indian, and Tajikistani agencies. If the macro is enabled, it drops and executes scripts that install the POWERSTATS backdoor. The macros utilize recent techniques like INF/SCT file abuse and AppLocker bypass for indirect code execution to avoid detection. The backdoor uses RSA encryption for C2 communications and can gather system info, take screenshots, run commands, and more. The macros also achieve persistence by imitating legitimate scheduled tasks. The backdoor code shows anti-analysis measures like sandbox detection and shutdown. It uses a large proxy network for command and control. While the technical sophistication is medium, the continual evolution in tactics, techniques, and procedures shows TEMP.Zagros rapidly incorporates new methods into campaigns. Organizations should block macros, patch exploitation vectors, and use threat intelligence to detect the indicators and infrastructure.
