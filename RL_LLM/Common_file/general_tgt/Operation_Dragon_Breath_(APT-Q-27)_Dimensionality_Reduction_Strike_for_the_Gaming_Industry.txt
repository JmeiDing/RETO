The PDF discusses the activities of a Chinese hacker group called Golden Eye Dog (also known as APT-Q-27), which targets gambling and gaming companies primarily in Southeast Asia. Golden Eye Dog has been active since at least 2015. They use watering hole attacks to infect victims with info-stealing malware. In 2020, the group started using more stealthy techniques to install malware, including compromised Telegram installers and abusing benign admin tools like TGlaunch. The malware includes capabilities to steal browser data like passwords from Chrome and crypto wallets. It uses multiple languages like Golang, C++, and Delphi. Analysis suggests Golden Eye Dog may be part of a larger group called Miuuti Group, which was potentially linked to 0-day attacks on messaging apps in 2015-2017. The report provides IOCs for the malware samples, command and control servers, and watering hole domains associated with Golden Eye Dog. Qi'anxin threat intelligence products can detect this group's activities based on the provided threat intel. The report aims to raise awareness of targeted attacks against the Asian gaming industry.
