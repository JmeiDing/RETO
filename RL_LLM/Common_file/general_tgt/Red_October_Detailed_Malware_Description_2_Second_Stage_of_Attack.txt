The PDF describes the second stage of attack used by the Red October malware. Red October is modular malware that is delivered in stages. The first stage gathers reconnaissance on the infected system. The second stage deploys additional modules that steal data, spread the malware, and maintain persistence. The second stage modules are either persistent, running continuously to wait for certain events like a mobile phone connecting, or one-time tasks that run once and collect specific data. Persistent tasks include stealing files from connected USB drives, stealing data from connected phones, spreading via the MS08-067 vulnerability, and more. One-time tasks gather system info, build directory listings, extract browsing history, collect application data, steal Outlook data, and more. The modules are organized into groups based on functionality like reconnaissance, password stealing, email theft, USB infection, spreading, and exfiltration. The modules gather data, encrypt it, and exfiltrate it to command and control servers. The configuration data reveals the command servers and paths used. In summary, the second stage of Red October is modular, persistent malware that builds on the reconnaissance of the first stage to steal data, spread, and maintain control of the infected system. The modular architecture allows the attackers to customize the malware by deploying only certain modules as needed for their goals.
