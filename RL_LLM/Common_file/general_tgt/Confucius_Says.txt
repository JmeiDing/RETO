The report from Palo Alto Networks analyzes two malware families called CONFUCIUS_A and CONFUCIUS_B that are using legitimate websites like Yahoo Answers and Quora to resolve their command and control servers. CONFUCIUS_A has links to an older malware called SNEEPY that targeted Pakistan. The CONFUCIUS_A malware uses a simple lookup table to decode keywords between phrases in order to retrieve its command and control address. The lookup table contains 255 words, each corresponding to a number. It is delivered via phishing emails pretending to be event invites, porn, software updates, news, etc. CONFUCIUS_A extracts its C2 IP from keywords on Quora and Yahoo pages between specific markers. CONFUCIUS_B uses a similar technique but relies on a lookup table to substitute keywords from Yahoo and Quora posts into IP address octets. The CONFUCIUS_B malware is disguised as a PowerPoint presentation and drops four files to the %AppData% folder when executed. It uses a custom obfuscation scheme to quickly identify variants of itself. It has loose links to the Patchwork cyberespionage group. Both malware families share code similarities like using Yahoo and Quora in this way for DNS resolution. The report concludes they were likely developed by the same threat actor or group, though operate separately based on targeting and infrastructure. The unusual technique shows innovation to bypass blocking of malicious domains by using legitimate sites. Palo Alto Networks detects the malware as malicious and can protect customers through threat prevention and domain blocking. The report provides IOCs and shows the ongoing evolution of cyberespionage groups to avoid defenses.
