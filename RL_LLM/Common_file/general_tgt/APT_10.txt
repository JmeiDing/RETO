Recorded Future and Rapid7 analyzed intrusions by the Chinese threat actor APT10 against a Norwegian MSP Visma, a US law firm, and an international apparel company.The attackers gained initial access through stolen credentials to Citrix servers and moved laterally. They used DLL sideloading to deploy malware like Trochilus and UPPERCUT. APT10 used legitimate tools like Mimikatz, BITSAdmin, cURL, and WinRAR for enumeration, credential harvesting, and data exfiltration. Data was exfiltrated to Dropbox accounts. Attribution was made to APT10 based on tactics, techniques, and procedures consistent with their previous campaigns, including DLL sideloading, UPPERCUT and Trochilus malware, infrastructure links, and targeting organizations with Chinese interests. The attacks aimed to steal intellectual property and gain commercial advantage, in line with APT10's espionage mission under China's Ministry of State Security. Defensive recommendations include monitoring VPN endpoints, Yara rules, access to Citrix servers, and other tactics to detect similar intrusions. So in summary, it was a cyberespionage campaign by APT10 relying on credential theft, lateral movement, custom malware, and cloud services to infiltrate and steal data.
