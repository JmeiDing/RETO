The document analyzes a new Linux malware called Symbiote discovered in November 2021. Symbiote is very stealthy and evasive, making it difficult to detect. Symbiote infects running processes using LD_PRELOAD instead of running as a standalone executable. This allows it to hide itself and parasitically infect the machine. Once infected, Symbiote provides rootkit functionality to hide files, processes, and network connections. It harvests credentials via hooks into SSH and SCP. Exfiltration occurs via encrypted DNS requests. Symbiote hijacks packet filtering to hide malicious network traffic. It injects bytecode to filter packets based on ports and IP addresses. Libpcap functions are also hooked to filter UDP traffic. Remote access is achieved by hooking PAM functions to allow authentication with a hardcoded password. This gives access via services like SSH. Encrypted C2 communications provide a backup access method. Symbiote targets financial organizations in Latin America. Impersonated bank domains were used for C2. Samples were submitted to VirusTotal likely for testing before deploying the malware. While Symbiote has similarities to Linux malware like Ebury, code analysis shows it is new and not based on existing malware. Its stealthy nature and multiple evasion techniques make it a sophisticated threat. The report emphasizes the need for strengthened Linux security, anti-virus, and network monitoring to detect threats like Symbiote that avoid traditional detection methods.
