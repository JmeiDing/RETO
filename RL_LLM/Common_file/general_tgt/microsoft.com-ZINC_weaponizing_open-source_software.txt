Microsoft has detected social engineering campaigns by a threat actor known as ZINC targeting organizations across various industries. ZINC has been weaponizing legitimate open-source software like PuTTY, KiTTY, TightVNC, Sumatra PDF Reader, and muPDF to deliver malware known as ZetaNile. The campaigns start with ZINC actors creating fake LinkedIn profiles posing as recruiters to establish trust with targets. They then encourage further communication over WhatsApp to deliver the weaponized software. The weaponized software does not directly contain malware. It requires connecting to specific IP addresses provided by the actors to trigger the malware installation. Once installed, the malware sends system info to the command and control server and allows the actor to install additional malware. Persistence is achieved by using scheduled tasks or DLL hijacking techniques. The malware uses encoded or encrypted C2 traffic to blend in. Microsoft has implemented detections and is notifying targeted customers. Recommended actions include investigating IOCs, blocking suspicious IPs, enabling MFA, and educating users. Key indicators of compromise and YARA rules are provided to help identify related activity. Microsoft Defender, Microsoft 365 Defender, and Microsoft Sentinel queries are included to surface associated threat signals.
