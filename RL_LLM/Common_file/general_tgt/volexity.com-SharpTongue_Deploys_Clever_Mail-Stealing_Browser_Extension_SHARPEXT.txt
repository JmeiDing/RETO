The security company Volexity has been tracking a threat actor they call SharpTongue, believed to be associated with North Korea. SharpTongue frequently targets individuals who work on topics of interest to North Korea, like nuclear issues and weapons systems. In recent incidents, Volexity discovered SharpTongue deploying a custom malicious browser extension called SHARPEXT to steal emails and attachments from victims' webmail accounts. SHARPEXT currently supports Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and the South Korean Whale browser. After compromising a system, SharpTongue exfiltrates files needed to install SHARPEXT. A VBS script kills the browser process, replaces key pref files to force load the extension, and runs PowerShell scripts to enable hidden developer tools and suppress browser warnings. SHARPEXT has three main components: 1) A PowerShell script that checks for targeted browsers, enables hidden dev tools on certain tabs, and suppresses warning popups. 2) A DevTools module that sends tab IDs and request/response info to the main extension code. 3) Extension code that adds listeners for tab changes and incoming messages, parses responses for emails, and exfiltrates stolen data. The extension watches the user's mailbox, parses responses for emails and attachments, and sends stolen data to a remote server. It maintains state to avoid duplicating data. SHARPEXT has evolved over multiple versions into a sophisticated email theft tool. Volexity recommends enabling PowerShell logging, monitoring browser extensions, and using provided YARA rules and IOCs to detect this activity. They have observed thousands of emails stolen via SHARPEXT deployments.
