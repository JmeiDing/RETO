The document is about a threat actor named APT36, which is believed to be a Pakistani state-sponsored group targeting India. The group has been active since 2016 and is known by various names such as Transparent Tribe, ProjectM, Mythic Leopard, and TEMP.Lapis. In March 2020, APT36 used a decoy health advisory document to spread the Remote Administration Tool (RAT) called Crimson RAT. The document was masquerading as an official government document from India's email.gov.in.maildrive[.]email domain. APT36 primarily uses spear phishing and watering hole attacks to gain access to its targets. In this specific attack, it sent a phishing email with a link to the malicious document containing macro code that dropped the Crimson RAT variant. The Crimson RAT is a sophisticated RAT that can steal credentials, list running processes and files, retrieve information from C&C servers, capture screenshots, and send collected data back to its server. It can also steal personal data such as passport scans, identification documents, text messages, and contact details. To protect against this type of attack, organizations should consider using endpoint protection systems or endpoint detection and response with exploit blocking and real-time malware detection. Additionally, keeping all software up-to-date and training employees and users to avoid opening coronavirus resources from unvetted sources can help shield against social engineering attacks.
