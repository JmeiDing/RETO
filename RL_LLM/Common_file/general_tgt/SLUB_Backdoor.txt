Security researchers at Trend Micro discovered a new malware campaign using multiple techniques to infect targets and exfiltrate data. The malware has two stages - first a downloader exploit using CVE-2018-8174, followed by the main payload backdoor called SLUB. The downloader checks for antivirus processes, exploits CVE-2015-1701 for privilege escalation, and retrieves the SLUB backdoor. SLUB establishes persistence and uses APIs to communicate with GitHub for commands and Slack for exfiltration. The attackers posted snippets on GitHub with commands starting with "^" that SLUB parses and executes, like taking screenshots, listing files, compressing folders, etc. The results are sent to the attacker's Slack workspace in dedicated channels per infected host. Analysis of the commands suggests the attackers are focused on gathering personal communications data from apps like Skype, Twitter, and Korean HWP files. The attacks are precisely executed with minimal infrastructure, suggesting capable threat actors rather than cybercriminals. The attackers created the GitHub and Slack accounts on February 19-20 and began testing the malware February 23-24 before infecting victims starting February 27. Trend Micro notified GitHub and Slack to disable the attacker accounts. Key points are the unique use of GitHub and Slack for the attack, the multi-stage infection process, the commands focused on communications and people data, the speed of the attack execution, and the takedown of the attacker accounts. The malware appears targeted at specific individuals rather than mass spread.
