Here is a summary of the key information in the PDF: The PDF describes malware tools discovered by the cybersecurity company Damballa that are associated with the Destover malware. Destover is best known for being used in the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures. It is a wiper malware that deletes files and renders systems inoperative. The PDF discusses two newly discovered utilities called setMFT and afset that are used alongside Destover. SetMFT is used to copy timestamp metadata from one file to another to help malicious files blend in and evade detection. Afset also modifies timestamps but can additionally remove event log entries to cover the attackers' tracks. Both setMFT and afset use the Eldos RawDisk driver, which allows direct disk access to alter metadata. They also have English usage instructions, suggesting they are interactively used by attackers on compromised systems. The PDF explains how these tools allow attackers to move laterally through a network while erasing their tracks, expanding their presence while staying undetected for longer periods of time. This enables large scale data exfiltration over months before deploying a destructive payload like Destover. The PDF concludes these stealth tools likely have limited distribution now but could evade antivirus detection if newer versions are developed. It emphasizes the persistence and determination of advanced attackers who penetrate networks in multiple steps while remaining hidden. Understanding this full attack lifecycle can help security teams better defend against intrusions.
