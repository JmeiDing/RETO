The report analyzes a July 2018 spearphishing campaign by APT10 targeting Japanese corporations. Malicious Word documents with VBA macros were sent as email attachments. The macros installed the UPPERCUT backdoor. The malware used the Notepad++ updater for DLL sideloading to execute the backdoor payload. ANTI-debugging techniques and randomized export function names were added in the new UPPERCUT version. The backdoor now generates encryption keys based on the C2 domain's MD5 hash instead of a hardcoded key. Additional commands were added including screenshot capture and timestamp formatting. The malware continues to evolve.
