The PDF describes the evolution of the LODEINFO backdoor malware used by the APT10 group in attacks against Japanese organizations in 2022. It provides an overview of new versions and enhancements made to the malware, including: - LODEINFO v0.5.6 added multiple encryption techniques for C2 communications using a Vigenere cipher, SHA512 hashing, XOR encryption, and AES encryption. It also added 3 new backdoor commands: comc, autorun, and config. - LODEINFO v0.5.9 changed the hashing algorithm used to resolve API function addresses, likely to evade detections and 0.5.8 added multiple encryption for C2 communication using random junk data respectively. - LODEINFO v0.6.2 added a check for the en_US locale and halts execution if found, as the group mainly targets Japanese entities. It also generates a Chrome user agent string for C2 communications. - LODEINFO v0.6.2 added support for injecting 64-bit shellcode with the 'memory' command. It checks the architecture of the shellcode and handles injection properly. - LODEINFO v0.6.3 reduced the number of backdoor commands from 21 down to 11, removing unnecessary commands. - The core modifications over time show the attacker's focus on evading detection and analysis, including complex encryption, customized hashing algorithms, architecture checks, and reducing the attack surface. - The PDF emphasizes the importance of collaboration to track the rapid evolution of LODEINFO and associated malware used in attacks by this persistent threat actor.
