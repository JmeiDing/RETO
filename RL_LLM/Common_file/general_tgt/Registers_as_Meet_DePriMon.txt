The document analyzes a malware called DePriMon, which is a malicious downloader that uses multiple unconventional techniques. DePriMon has been active since at least March 2017, targeting private companies in Central Europe and dozens of computers in the Middle East. DePriMon achieves persistence by registering itself as a port monitor, masquerading as the "Windows Default Print Monitor." At system startup, it gets loaded with SYSTEM privileges, making it very stealthy and effective. The malware has a complex, modular architecture with extensive encryption. It communicates with C&C servers over SSL/TLS using the Windows Secure Channel implementation, encrypting messages and decrypting configuration data in memory only when needed. The configuration file contains proxies, usernames, passwords, C&C servers, and other info. DePriMon can collect basic system info and exists solely in memory. It ultimately downloads additional payloads from its operators. The malware is carefully designed with proper encryption and secure functioning. Its unconventional techniques like the port monitor persistence and selective decryption make analysis difficult. DePriMon is considered an advanced, flexible threat used in targeted campaigns in the analyzed regions.
