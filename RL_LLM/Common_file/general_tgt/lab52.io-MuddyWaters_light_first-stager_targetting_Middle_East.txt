The document describes a malware campaign by the threat actor group MuddyWater, allegedly linked to the Iranian government, targeting countries in the Middle East since late 2020. The infection starts with a malicious Word document containing macros that drops a VBScript remote access trojan (RAT). The RAT contacts command and control servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data. The macros in the Word docs write obfuscated VBScripts to startup folders or ProgramData. The scripts contain preset country codes indicating intended targets like Pakistan, Armenia, Syria, etc. The scripts do network recon by executing Windows commands and sending results to C2 servers. Commands received are executed and output sent back. The scripts have an unused functionality that can display system info via WMI if a flag is set. This suggests the threat actors may modify functionality later based on recon data. The campaigns have continued from 2020 to early 2022 suggesting an ongoing operation to compromise systems in the Middle East, likely to further Iranian interests in the region. Indicators of compromise from document samples over time are provided, including MD5 hashes, script names, C2 IPs. The evolving techniques and ongoing nature highlight the threat actor's persistence in targeting the Middle East to maintain access and enable potential future operations.
