The document discusses the ongoing activities of a financially-motivated threat actor group called DeathStalker. The campaign, attributed to DeathStalker, has been ongoing since at least August 2020 with various malicious activities including Janicab, Evilnum, and PowerSing campaigns. In particular, it focuses on DeathStalker's use of a Python remote access trojan (RAT) called VileRAT and its associated infection chain to target foreign currency and cryptocurrency exchanges since mid-2020. VileRAT is delivered via spearphishing emails containing weaponized Word docs. The docs fetch a malicious macro document that profiles the target system and deploys the next stage - an obfuscated JavaScript backdoor called VileDropper. This backdoor drops and executes VileLoader, a custom .NET binary loader. VileLoader connects to a command and control server to download the final payload, which is the VileRAT Python RAT. VileRAT allows the threat actor full remote control, including command execution, keylogging, screenshotting, etc. It uses HTTP requests with encrypted JSON data to communicate with its C2. VileRAT and its associated malware have been continuously updated over 2+ years while targeting the same types of financial organizations globally. The intricate obfuscation and evasion techniques match DeathStalker's usual tactics. The report details the evolution of the malware, the encoding schemes, C2 infrastructure, intended targets, and other technical analysis. The attacks are still ongoing, indicating DeathStalker's determination to gain persistent access to currency exchanges for likely financial gain, although the exact motivation remains unclear. The report aims to provide thorough IOCs and recommendations to detect this advanced malware campaign victimizing the finance sector worldwide.
