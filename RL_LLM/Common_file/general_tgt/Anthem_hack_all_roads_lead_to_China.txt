The document analyzes the attribution of the 2015 Anthem health insurance data breach, which impacted approximately 80 million customers. Researchers at ThreatConnect leveraged their threat intelligence platform to uncover links between the Anthem breach and previous cyberattacks attributed to Chinese state-sponsored groups. By pivoting on malware signatures, domain registrant information, and other technical indicators, the researchers connected the Anthem hackers to a threat group they call Animal Farm. Animal Farm has been active since at least 2009 and uses custom malware like Derusbi/Sakula. These malware samples were signed with legitimate digital certificates stolen from Korean companies to evade detection. Animal Farm infrastructure involved domains impersonating Anthem's parent company WellPoint. The group has also targeted US defense contractors, the OPM, and insurers like Premera Blue Cross. Links exist between Animal Farm and a Chinese APT collective called Deep Panda. Further pivoting led researchers to a Chinese professor named Song Yubo at Southeast University in Nanjing, China. Song Yubo collaborates with and receives funding from the Chinese Ministry of State Security. He organized a Chinese hacking competition sponsored by Beijing Topsec, a company with proven ties to the Chinese government and military. The timing of the competition aligned with the registration of some Animal Farm domains. While not definitive, the researchers concluded that the technical indicators, malware signatures, infrastructure links, and Song Yubo's profile and relationships point to Chinese state-sponsored actors as responsible for the Anthem breach, likely to collect intelligence on US government employees.
