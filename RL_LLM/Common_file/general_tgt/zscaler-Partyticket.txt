The document analyzes the PartyTicket ransomware, which was likely used as a diversion for the Hermetic wiper malware that targeted Ukraine. PartyTicket is an unsophisticated ransomware that generates a single deterministic AES key to encrypt files, allowing files to be decrypted. It copies itself to encrypt each file, slowing systems down. The malware has odd design choices like not terminating processes first and referencing jokes about President Biden. It encrypts files with common extensions after renaming them. The ransom note contains a hardcoded RSA public key to encrypt the AES key. The encrypted files contain the AES nonce, encrypted data, tag, and RSA encrypted AES key. PartyTicket stands out as rushed and poorly designed compared to typical ransomware. It was likely intended as a distraction from the data wiping objective of HermeticWiper. The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes. It shows how ransomware can be used as a cover for more destructive malware in targeted attacks. Zscaler detects the malware with advanced threat signatures and sandboxing.
