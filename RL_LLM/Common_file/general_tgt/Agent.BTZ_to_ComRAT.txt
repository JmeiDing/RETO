The document analyzes the evolution of the sophisticated ComRAT malware, which is the successor to the Agent.BTZ remote access trojan (RAT). Both are linked to the Uroburos rootkit and used by the same threat actor in targeted campaigns. The analysis covers 7 years of development across 10 major versions of the RAT, from Agent.BTZ v1.0 in 2007 to ComRAT v3.26 in 2014. Version info shows incremental changes over time with the biggest update in v3.00 transitioning it from Agent.BTZ to ComRAT. Early versions of Agent.BTZ rely on AutoRun for infection and use a simple XOR cipher and ASCII config. Later versions add obfuscation, support for Windows Vista, bug fixes, and COM object hijacking.  ComRAT in v3.00 switches compilers, name, comms, injects all processes, and leverages pipes for IPC. It exfiltrates more system info and abandons AutoRun. Later versions add logging, multiple C2s, new registry persistence, and further string obfuscation. The RAT evolved to support new Windows versions, evade detection, fix bugs, and enhance capabilities over time. The timeline matches reported attacks on high-value targets like government bodies. The threat actor behind it continues to actively develop multiple malware strains to compromise targets. Their tools show an interest in persisting on systems long-term while exfiltrating sensitive data. The analysis provides valuable historical insight into the adversary's malware development lifecycle over many years.
