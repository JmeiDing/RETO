The PDF describes a new data-destroying Trojan called CryWiper that was detected attacking an organization's network in Russia in Fall 2022. CryWiper pretends to be ransomware by leaving a ransom note demanding payment in bitcoin to decrypt files. However, analysis shows CryWiper does not actually encrypt files, but rather irreversibly overwrites them with pseudo-random data generated using the Mersenne Twister algorithm. CryWiper is a 64-bit Windows executable likely developed using MinGW on Linux. After starting via Task Scheduler, it contacts a command and control server to get the command 'run' which triggers destruction. It stops critical processes like databases and email servers to access occupied files. CryWiper skips files in certain directories like Windows and Trend Micro, but destroys documents, media, source code etc. The ransom note uses typical ransomware messaging, providing a BTC wallet, email contact, and fixed victim ID. But since the data is destroyed, the ID serves no purpose. The email address used was also found in past ransomware samples, suggesting possible code reuse. While CryWiper is a new family, the use of Mersenne Twister PRNG links it to IsaacWiper which targeted Ukraine. The code destruction approach shows the intent is disruption, not financial gain. The number of such wiper attacks is increasing amid geopolitical tensions. Protection requires behavioral detection, endpoint security, email scanning, penetration testing, threat monitoring, and threat intelligence.
