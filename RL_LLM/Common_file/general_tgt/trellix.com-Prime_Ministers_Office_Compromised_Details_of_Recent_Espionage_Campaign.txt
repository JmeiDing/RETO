The Advanced Threat Research Team at Trellix identified a multi-stage espionage campaign targeting government officials and defense industry personnel in Western Asia. The initial infection starts with an email containing an Excel attachment that exploits a Microsoft Office vulnerability to download and execute malware. The malware, named Graphite, uses the Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive accounts for command and control. Graphite gathers system info and can execute additional payloads. It was likely developed using the Empire post-exploitation framework. Further stages of the attack involve Empire stagers and agents to gain full remote access to compromised systems. The infrastructure includes domains registered in 2021 that host exploit code and the Empire server. Based on working hours and activity patterns, the threat actor is believed to operate out of Eastern Europe, possibly Russia. While not definitively attributed, some tactics align with previously reported activities of APT28. The full capabilities of the attacker remain unknown, but the infrastructure and techniques demonstrate an advanced adversary targeting Eastern Europe and the defense industry for likely espionage motives. Indicators of compromise and mitigation recommendations were provided to known victims.
