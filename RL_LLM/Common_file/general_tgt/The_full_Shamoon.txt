The document describes research by IBM's X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) team into recent Shamoon malware attacks against organizations in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. - Shamoon is destructive malware that wipes computer hard drives. The recent attacks occurred in November 2016 and January 2017. - The IRIS team identified the initial point of compromise as weaponized Office documents with malicious macros. When opened, the macros executed PowerShell commands to enable command line access and communicate with attacker servers. - The attackers used PowerShell-laden documents themed as resumes and HR documents to target organizations and establish an initial foothold. The documents were likely delivered via spear phishing. - Analysis of the macro code shows it executed two PowerShell scripts - one downloaded additional malware, while the other used Metasploit functions to retrieve and execute a PowerShell payload from a remote server. - The attackers studied the networks and eventually deployed three files related to Shamoon, which enabled the coordinated malware outbreak to wipe hard drives. - The attacks affected thousands of computers across multiple organizations, destroying critical data and disrupting operations. - While the known Shamoon attacks have subsided after public exposure, the actors are expected to reappear in future waves with evolved tactics. Saudi Arabia has released alerts to help organizations defend against and prepare for potential Shamoon attacks.
