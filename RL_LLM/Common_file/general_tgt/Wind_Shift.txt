The document analyzes a macOS malware named OSX.WindTail utilized by a cyberespionage group called WindShift to target individuals in the Middle East. Key points: - WindShift likely uses a custom URL scheme vulnerability to remotely infect Macs as an initial infection vector. - The malware persists via a login item and hides itself by not having an icon. It generates a unique ID on first run. - Main capabilities are connecting to C2 servers, executing commands, and exfiltrating files. C2 domains identified. - OSX.WindTail uses AES encryption with a hardcoded key to decrypt C2 URLs and file extensions of interest. - It moves itself to the user's Library folder and executes a copy to gain persistence. - Most samples not detected by antivirus engines, but can be found by tools like KnockKnock that check for suspicious login items and applications. - Tied to WindShift based on naming, infection technique, C2 domains, AES key, and targeting of Middle East. In summary, the document provides a thorough analysis of the WindShift group's OSX.WindTail Mac malware, its infection tactics, capabilities, and ties to the cyberespionage campaign.
