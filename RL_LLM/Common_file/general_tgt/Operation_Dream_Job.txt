The report by ClearSky Security details the activities of a North Korean cyberespionage group called Lazarus carrying out a campaign dubbed "Operation Dream Job." The group uses fake LinkedIn recruiter profiles to target employees at defense and aerospace companies with appealing job offers. If interested, the target is sent a malicious document to download containing malware. The malware goes through multiple stages to gain persistence and install a remote access trojan called DRATzarus on the victim's computer. DRATzarus is used to deploy other tools for further exploitation. Three main infection techniques are outlined, including weaponized PDF, DOC, and DOTM files. Each delivers a downloaderTrojan that retrieves additional payloads. Attribution to Lazarus is made through code similarities in the malware, reuse of infrastructure, and connections to previous Lazarus campaigns. The report provides indicators of compromise and recommendations for detection and mitigation of similar socially engineered attacks. It concludes that Operation Dream Job is a sophisticated global campaign by Lazarus to gain access to sensitive defense and technological firms for espionage and potential financial theft. In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by the Lazarus group in Operation Dream Job to infect targets and steal data through malicious documents sent via convincing recruiter impersonations.
