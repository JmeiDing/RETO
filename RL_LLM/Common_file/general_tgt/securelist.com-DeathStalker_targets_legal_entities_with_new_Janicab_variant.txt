The report details a new variant of the Janicab malware used by the DeathStalker threat actor group to target legal entities in the Middle East in 2020-2021. Janicab is a cross-platform malware first seen in 2013 that uses a VBScript implant as the final payload on Windows instead of Powershell. Janicab is a modular, interpreted-language malware that allows for flexibility in adding or removing functions. The new variant uses YouTube video links as a dead drop resolver (DDR) to retrieve the C2 server IP address. Some links date back to 2015, indicating infrastructure reuse. The initial infection uses a LNK dropper in a ZIP file attached to a spearphishing email. The LNK runs a chained execution flow dropping multiple stages leading to the Janicab VBScript. Janicab shares code similarities with other DeathStalker malware like Powersing and EVILNUM. It uses Python scripts, keyloggers, reverse SSH tunnels, etc. for post-exploitation activities. The PHP-based C2 follows the typical command handling seen before. Victims are primarily law firms, financial entities, and some travel agencies in the Middle East and Europe. Defenses should focus on application whitelisting to block the interpreter-based malware, monitoring for hidden Internet Explorer C2 traffic, and watching for DDR lookups to IP addresses instead of domains. The report hypothesizes the attacks intend to gain intelligence on legal/financial matters of VIPs or competitive intelligence.
