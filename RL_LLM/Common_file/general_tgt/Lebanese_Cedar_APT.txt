The report details the activities of the Lebanese Cedar advanced persistent threat (APT) group, which has been conducting cyber espionage campaigns since 2012. The group primarily targets companies and organizations globally by compromising vulnerable public-facing web servers. The report provides an overview of the group's current tools, which include custom malware like the Caterpillar web shell and Explosive remote access trojan (RAT). It also uses some open source tools. The report analyzes the group's tactics, techniques and procedures, mapping them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This includes initial access via web server exploits, installing web shells for persistence, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. An in-depth examination of the Caterpillar web shell reveals various modules for reconnaissance, command execution, and privilege escalation. The Explosive RAT has keylogging and screenshot capabilities. Attribution analysis points to the Lebanese government or Hezbollah-linked actors. Code overlap links recent activity to this group's previous campaigns. Compromised servers were detected worldwide, but concentrated in the Middle East. The report concludes that Lebanese Cedar has remained stealthy by selectively targeting victims and using common hacking tools. Their main initial foothold is vulnerable web servers, which they compromise to install custom malware like Caterpillar and Explosive for espionage objectives.
