The document analyzes a recent phishing and malware campaign dubbed 'Big Bang' targeted against institutions in the Middle East, particularly the Palestinian Authority. The attacks distribute a self-extracting archive containing a decoy Word document and malware executable. The malware is installed in the background while the Word document serves as a decoy to distract victims. Once the attacker finds what he is looking for, a second stage of the attack awaits, fetching additional modules and/or malware from the Command and Control server. The malware gathers system information, documents, and screenshots to exfiltrate to adversary command and control servers. It has multiple modules for reconnaissance activities, fetching additional payloads, and maintaining persistence. Module names reference pop culture topics. Researchers uncovered evolving attacker tactics between this 2018 campaign and previous 2017 activity. The malware is an upgraded version with new capabilities like backup C2 servers. Lures pose as Palestinian Authority content and reference regional news. Attribution is unclear but similarities exist to previous Gaza Cybergang operations in the region. While targets appear highly selective, the end goals of the full attack chain are unknown. The malware is assessed to be in an initial reconnaissance stage pending deployment of later stages. Indicators of compromise are provided including sample hashes, C2 domains, and operational security mistakes made by the attackers. The campaign shows an adversary interested in compromised access to Middle East government entities through upgraded malware and refined social engineering.
