The PDF describes analysis of a new backdoor malware discovered in a cyberattack investigation by Talent-Jump Technologies. The backdoor utilizes the Dropbox API for command and control. The backdoor can bypass UAC (User Account Control) using .NET and persist itself as a system service or autorun program. The initial infection vector is not specified. The backdoor is installed via a multi-stage process using signed binaries like MsMpEng.exe to proxy execute shellcode that decrypts the final payload. The backdoor's capabilities include system information collection, screenshot capture, keylogging, clipboard logging, UAC bypass, persistence, and C2 comms. A hardcoded Dropbox API token allows it to communicate with the attacker's Dropbox account. It uploads logs and receives additional payloads from Dropbox folders. A second stage backdoor provides full remote control using the Dropbox API. The threat actor uses Dropbox as another C&C server with full remote control features, allowing them to steal data and infiltrate entire companies. Analysis of the Dropbox account revealed details of 200+ infected hosts, victim data theft, additional malware deployment, and the attacker's activities. The campaign targeted organizations in Asia and remained active from Jul-Sep 2019. The report concludes that the innovative use of legitimate services like Dropbox for command and control makes this backdoor difficult to isolate. Robust threat detection capabilities are required to identify such stealthy multi-stage malware. Continuously tracking attacker infrastructure can reveal important details about ongoing campaigns.
