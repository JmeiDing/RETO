The PDF describes renewed malware campaigns conducted by the financially-motivated threat actor group TA505, also known as Whatsaap. TA505 is known for large-scale email campaigns delivering remote access trojans like FlawedGrace. Starting in September 2021, Proofpoint researchers observed new TA505 campaigns distributing emails with Excel attachments. The emails used lures like legal notices and targeted North America. The Excel macros downloaded an MSI file which executed a Rebol script loader called MirrorBlast. In late September, TA505 shifted to high-volume email campaigns up to hundreds of thousands of messages. The lures became more generic like “SECUREFILE”. The attack chain now includes an additional KiXtart script loader. It ultimately delivers an updated FlawedGrace RAT variant. The campaigns target a wider range of industries and expanded beyond North America to German-speaking countries. Many similarities exist to historic TA505 campaigns from 2019-2020 in tactics, techniques, and procedures. These include using identical Excel lures, domain naming schemes, and FlawedGrace itself. The intermediate Rebol and KiXtart script loaders replace the previously used Get2 downloader. They perform reconnaissance and download the next payload. FlawedGrace can exfiltrate data, deliver modules, and remotely control the system. Proofpoint assesses with high confidence that TA505 is responsible for this activity given the similarities to their known campaigns. They expect the threat actor to continue evolving their methods for financial gain. The new loaders and updated FlawedGrace highlight TA505’s constant tool evolution. In summary, the report provides insight into TA505's latest tools, expanded targeting, and ongoing large-scale malware operations for financial gain by abusing trust in brands like Microsoft.
