The document analyzes a large-scale malware campaign dubbed Aggah that leverages multiple stages to deliver the RevengeRAT Trojan. It starts with weaponized Office documents exploiting Template Injection to load a macro document from a remote server. The macros retrieve scripts from BlogSpot that ultimately download RevengeRAT payloads from Pastebin links. The campaign uses shortened Bitly URLs in the Office docs to hide the redirects to BlogSpot. The scripts hosted on BlogSpot disable security products like Defender and kill Office processes. The BlogSpot scripts create scheduled tasks and registry keys to maintain persistence, fetching additional scripts from Pastebin. The final payload is RevengeRAT configured to communicate with duckdns domains. RevengeRAT payloads across the campaign share unique mutexes, encoded identifiers, and splitter strings, suggesting a common actor. Available builders indicate these strings are manually set during generation. The campaign targeted the Middle East but expanded to the US, Europe, and Asia hitting various verticals. Bitly stats show 1900+ clicks on lures, indicating a broad campaign. Links, registry keys, and other IOCs are provided. The report does not definitively tie Aggah to Gorgon Group as initially hypothesized, but says the actors show some sophistication in hiding C2 behind legitimate services like BlogSpot and Pastebin. Overall, it provides insight into an evolving adversary tradecraft.
