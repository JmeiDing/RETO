The PDF analyzes a new variant of the PlugX malware named Talisman. PlugX has been used internationally for over a decade and is associated with Chinese state-sponsored groups. The execution flow involves a signed benign executable loading a modified DLL which executes shellcode to decrypt the Talisman payload. Talisman operates as a backdoor with plug-in capabilities. Unique aspects of Talisman compared to other PlugX variants include a different internal configuration signature and minor code variations. Dates in the plug-ins indicate the actors likely have the malware source code. Infrastructure overlaps and targeting of telecoms and defense in South Asia point to the RedFoxtrot/Nomad Panda group with medium confidence. Talisman allows remote control, screen captures, keylogging and other spying capabilities. Overall, Talisman shows the continued evolution of PlugX and its use by Chinese actors. The PDF provides indicators of compromise and MITRE ATT&CK techniques observed. Monitoring of PlugX developments is recommended due to its adaptable nature.
