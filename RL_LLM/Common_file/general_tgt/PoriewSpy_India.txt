The PDF describes a malware campaign targeting Android users in India called PoriewSpy. It was discovered in late 2017 and is believed to be created by a hacking group previously known for targeting government officials. PoriewSpy is capable of recording audio, stealing contacts, SMS messages, call logs, location data, and other sensitive information from infected devices. It disguises itself as a nude photo app but then hides its icon. The malware turns the device into an audio recorder, secretly recording the user even when not on a call. The hackers also used separate malicious apps built with the DroidJack RAT that share command and control infrastructure with PoriewSpy. These apps masquerade as legitimate apps and request extensive permissions to fully control the device. The report analyzes the code of PoriewSpy and its evolution over time. It uncovers the IP addresses of the command and control servers, several of which were previously used by the suspected hacking group in cyberespionage campaigns. The PDF provides indicators of compromise and recommendations for mobile security solutions to detect and block similar malware. It highlights that targeted mobile malware attacks are rising and users should only install apps from trustworthy sources and be cautious of permissions requested.
