Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF document: The PDF describes a new Android spyware named ActionSpy that is being spread via phishing attacks by a threat actor group called Earth Empusa. Earth Empusa created a fake Android app download page mimicking a legitimate app store to trick users into downloading ActionSpy masquerading as a popular Tibetan video app. Analysis of ActionSpy reveals it is spyware that can exfiltrate extensive data from compromised devices. ActionSpy collects device information, location data, call logs, contacts, SMS messages, browser bookmarks, installed apps, running processes, WiFi hotspots, files, and can record audio, take photos, and capture screenshots. It abuses Android Accessibility to steal chat logs from apps like WeChat, QQ, WhatsApp and Viber. The malware uses encryption and other obfuscation to evade detection. It has been active since at least 2017 and communicates with command and control servers to exfiltrate data. Earth Empusa has also been observed compromising websites to inject exploit code targeting iOS devices using watering hole attacks. They determine the iOS version from network requests and deliver the matching exploit to jailbreak the device. The report concludes that Earth Empusa is widening their targeting scope beyond an initial focus on Uyghurs and Tibetans. Their attacks now also encompass targets in Turkey and Taiwan using phishing and watering hole attacks to spread Android and iOS malware. Defenders are advised to keep devices updated and use mobile security solutions.
