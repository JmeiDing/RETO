 The document analyzes the cyberespionage group called Inception Framework. Inception has been active since at least 2014, targeting organizations globally across sectors like energy, defense, aerospace, and more. Their goals appear to be espionage-driven. Inception initially used spearphishing emails with weaponized Office documents exploiting vulnerabilities to infect victims. The malware payload communicated with a C2 server on CloudMe using compromised routers, mainly in South Korea, as proxies to hide its activity. After a brief dormant period, Inception resumed attacks in 2015. The group evolved its tactics, using new reconnaissance documents to fingerprint targets before sending a second spearphishing email with the actual exploit document days later. Inception's malware is now modular with different plugins for surveillance. It exfiltrates data to various cloud storage providers for C2, not just CloudMe anymore. The group continues to hide behind chains of compromised routers and servers. Inception has also created mobile malware for Android, iOS, and Blackberry devices. They use SMS and links to spread the Android malware. In summary, Inception is a persistent, sophisticated threat actor that continues to adapt its malware, exploit documents, infrastructure, and tactics to avoid detection while stealing data from targeted organizations globally. They are an early adopter of new technologies like cloud, IoT, and mobile to empower their cyberespionage operations.
