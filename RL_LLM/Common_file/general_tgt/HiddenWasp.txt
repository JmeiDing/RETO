The PDF analyzes a new malware called HiddenWasp that is targeting Linux systems. HiddenWasp has a zero-detection rate in antivirus systems and is actively being used for targeted remote control, not crypto-mining or DDoS. Key points: HiddenWasp uses a trojan, rootkit, and initial deployment script. It has adopted code from open-source malware like Mirai and Azazel. The initial deployment script creates a user, downloads the malware, cleans the system, sets environment variables, and installs reboot persistence. The rootkit uses LD_PRELOAD to hook functions like fopen and hide artifacts. It checks for the 'I_AM_HIDDEN' variable from the trojan. The trojan retrieves an encrypted JSON config using a modified RC4 cipher. It patches the linker to change the LD_PRELOAD path to hide the rootkit. The trojan and rootkit work together - the rootkit hides the trojan and the trojan helps load the rootkit. The trojan uses a custom TCP-based protocol to communicate with the C2 server. Commands allow uploading, downloading, execution, and more. Prevention involves blocking the C2 IPs. Response is a YARA rule and checking ld.so files for patching. In summary, HiddenWasp is an advanced, modular Linux trojan and rootkit with multiple stages that allows targeted remote control of compromised systems. It uses code from open-source malware but remains undetected.
