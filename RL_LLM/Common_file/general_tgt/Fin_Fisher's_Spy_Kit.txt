The report analyzes malware sent to Bahraini pro-democracy activists in April and May 2012. The malware was delivered via emails purporting to contain political content. Analysis suggests the malware is FinSpy, part of the FinFisher intrusion and monitoring toolkit sold by Gamma International. Once executed, the malware installs itself and collects extensive data from the infected system including screenshots, keystrokes, audio recordings, and chat logs. The data is encrypted and stored locally before exfiltration. The malware uses numerous anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques to evade detection, including process hollowing and hooking. It tailors techniques to the specific antivirus software found on the victim system. The command and control server was traced to an IP address owned by Bahrain's main telecom provider. Traffic analysis revealed the malware sends stolen data over ports 443 and 4111. Debug strings and code similarities link the malware to the commercial FinFisher suite. The surveillance capabilities match promotional materials for FinFisher's FinSpy tool. This suggests Bahraini authorities used FinSpy to target political dissidents. The level of sophistication shows the resources commercial spyware tools provide to governments for hacking and surveillance. The potential for abuse underscores the need for oversight around the sale of such intrusion capabilities.
