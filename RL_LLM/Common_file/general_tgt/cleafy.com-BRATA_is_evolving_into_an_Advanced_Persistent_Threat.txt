The document describes the evolution of the Android banking malware BRATA into an advanced persistent threat (APT). BRATA has been active since mid-2021 targeting banks in Europe. Recent BRATA campaigns demonstrate an APT-style attack pattern of compromising specific financial institutions for months before rotating to new targets. The BRATA malware now includes two new permissions, RECEIVE_SMS and SEND_SMS, which can be used for a complete Account Takeover attack. New BRATA variants add capabilities like: - Phishing login pages to steal credentials - Requests for intrusive permissions like GPS, overlays, SMS etc. - Downloading additional payloads from C2 for enhanced monitoring - Keylogging and event logging to steal data from other apps A related SMS stealing app shows code overlap with BRATA, indicating the actors are expanding their tools. BRATA now focuses on individual banks at a time, tailoring the malware to their apps and processes before moving on. This allows the threat actors to deeply infiltrate target networks. The continuous improvements to BRATA show the group has resources and plans to sustain long-term intrusions on financial networks. Banks need proactive protections to detect BRATA variants early and disrupt the attacker's kill chain. The report concludes that BRATA is increasingly demonstrating the hallmarks of an advanced persistent threat and may continue to evolve its tactics, techniques and procedures.
