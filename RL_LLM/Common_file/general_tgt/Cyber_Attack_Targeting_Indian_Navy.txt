The PDF describes a cyberattack campaign targeting Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL), an Indian company that manufactures submarines and warships for the Indian Navy. - On January 25, 2017, the day before India's Republic Day celebrations, attackers sent spear-phishing emails pretending to be from a Spanish naval equipment company called Hidrofersa. The emails contained malicious Excel files that installed a malware called KeyBase if macros were enabled. The attackers researched the trust relationship between MDL and Hidrofersa, a equipment manufacturer, to increase the chances of recipients opening the attachment. - KeyBase is a spyware that can steal sensitive information like keystrokes, screenshots, browser history etc and send it back to the attackers. The timing of the attack suggests the attackers wanted to steal sensitive design information about MDL's submarines and warships. - The malware communicated with a command and control server at the domain tripleshop[.]id hosted on a server in Indonesia. The attackers used obfuscated macro code and downloaded malware from a compromised university site in Indonesia to carry out the attack. - Analysis of the email headers suggests the attack may have originated from a Pakistan-based freight company called Combined Freight. Previous campaigns have also targeted Indian government organizations and embassies. - The attack shows hallmarks of a state-sponsored campaign to steal intellectual property and gain military advantages. The malware was designed to be stealthy and evade detection. Cyber espionage groups continue to target defense industries and manufacturers to steal proprietary information.
