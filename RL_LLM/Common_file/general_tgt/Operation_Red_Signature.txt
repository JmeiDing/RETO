The document describes a supply chain cyberattack called Operation Red Signature that targeted organizations in South Korea. The attackers compromised the update server of a remote support solutions provider to deliver malware to their targets. The threat actors first stole the certificate of the remote support provider, then used it to sign malware. They configured the provider's update server to only deliver malware to IP ranges of their targeted organizations when clients connected for updates. The malware delivered was a remote access trojan called 9002 RAT. This connected to a command and control server and installed additional tools for stealing data from the target's web server and database servers. The 9002 RAT malware was set to deactivate itself at the end of July 2018, indicating the attack campaign was short-lived. The attackers used compromised digital certificates, targeting of specific IP ranges, and trojanizing legitimate software updates to carry out a supply chain cyberattack and breach their targets while avoiding detection. Recommendations to mitigate supply chain attacks include overseeing 3rd party services, incident response planning, network monitoring, least privilege principles, and advanced threat detection.
