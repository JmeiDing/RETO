The report analyzes the tactics and malware of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group named ToddyCat that has targeted high-profile entities in Europe and Asia since late 2020. ToddyCat compromised Exchange servers using an unknown exploit to deploy a multi-stage infection chain including the China Chopper web shell. This installed two custom backdoors - Samurai and Ninja. The malware uses a "special resolution function" to call Windows APIs and decrypt files using 3DES (112)-bit encryption. Samurai is a modular C# backdoor that receives encrypted C# code from the attacker to execute on comprised systems. Ninja is a sophisticated C++ post-exploitation tool allowing multiple operators to control the system, which is mapped in memory by the loader without the DOS header and is invoked by calling an exported function named "Debug". ToddyCat tailored its infrastructure per victim, registering lookalike domains mimicking software used by the target. It used VPS services like Linode, Namecheap and DreamVPS for command and control. The group evolved its malware with new loader variants throughout 2021, storing payloads encrypted in the registry, file system or event logs. Loaders used tricks like process injection and API resolution to evade detection. After targeting only Exchange servers initially, ToddyCat expanded to send Ninja malware to desktop systems via Telegram. The attacks focused on government and military entities in Asia, but also impacted Europe. While links to other APTs are unclear, ToddyCat shows sophisticated tradecraft in crypters, proxy tools, anti-analysis measures and collaborative remote access capabilities. The report provides IOCs and YARA rules to detect the group's activities.
