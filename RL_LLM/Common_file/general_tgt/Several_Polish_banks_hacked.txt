The article reports on a series of cyberattacks targeting multiple Polish banks in early 2017, resulting in information theft. The banks detected unusual network activity and unauthorized files on internal systems. The initial infection vector is suspected to be a compromised JavaScript file on the website of Poland's financial regulatory body, the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF), which allowed malware to be loaded onto visitors' machines. The malware was not recognized by antivirus solutions at the time. It connected to foreign command and control servers, performed reconnaissance of the bank networks, achieved lateral movement, and exfiltrated large amounts of encrypted data. While the motivation is unknown, there were no reported direct financial losses to banks or customers. The malware featured multiple stages, encryption, and commercial packers to evade detection. The article provides indicators of compromise including file hashes, C2 IP addresses, and suspicious URLs hosted on the KNF website. It notes this was a serious incident demonstrating that even security-focused organizations can be breached. Information sharing between banks helped identify the infections. In summary, the report examines a sophisticated cyberattack campaign that compromised multiple Polish banks in 2017 by leveraging malware planted on a government financial regulator's website. Large amounts of data were exfiltrated but direct financial theft was not observed.
