The report analyzes a spearphishing campaign by the threat actor group SectorB06, which targeted victims using a Mongolian language decoy document exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability. SectorB06 sent the decoy document containing an exploit for CVE-2017-11882. The malware drops the first-stage DLL at "%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP\cclerr.wll" and runs it. If successful, it drops a malware DLL which resolves APIs, checks for debuggers, and drops files for persistence. The malware renames a signed Symantec file to help evade detection. The main two files dropped by the malware for persistence have an approximate timestamp of kernel32.dll. The malware identifies its victims using the "user" identifier from the \Hive\SoftwareIntel\Java registry key with the name "user", identifies victims, runs commands to modify permissions, and timestomps files. It injects next stage malware into the dllhost process without writing it to disk. The second stage malware connects to C2 servers, references internal IP addresses, and builds remote shells. Each malware executable seems to be custom compiled per victim organization. SectorB06 tailors the internal IP addresses in the malware per victim. The group already has some access to target networks before sending the spearphishing. The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, IP addresses, and MITRE ATT&CK techniques observed. It shows how SectorB06 continues to evolve their malware and bypass defenses. Their target profiling and custom malware compilation per organization make their attacks more focused.
