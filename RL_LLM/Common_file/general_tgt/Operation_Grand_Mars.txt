The document analyzes an advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign dubbed "Operation Grand Mars" that targeted the hospitality industry in Europe and the US in 2016. The attacks involved sending phishing emails with malicious Word docs to infect systems and establish persistence. Once infected, additional malware and tools were downloaded to facilitate lateral movement, data exfiltration, and remote access. The initial infection started with emails containing Word docs that used macros to execute embedded malicious scripts. These scripts connected to Google services to download PowerShell scripts and other malware. Persistence was achieved using scheduled tasks, services, and registry autoruns. Pass-the-hash attacks were used to escalate privileges and move laterally. Additional tools downloaded included variants of the Anunak and Carbanak remote access trojans, credential stealers, keyloggers, and Cobalt Strike's Beacon. These provided ongoing access, surveillance capabilities, and data exfiltration via encrypted C2 channels. The attackers also used public cloud services like Pastebin and Google Docs for command and control. Some payloads were signed with valid but likely fraudulently obtained certificates from Comodo. Technical analysis suggests the work of a sophisticated, organized group adept at infiltrating networks for financial gain. While hospitality was targeted, other industries are equally at risk. The report provides indicators of compromise and recommendations for detection and prevention. In summary, it provides an in-depth look at the tactics, techniques, and tools used in a covert cybercrime operation to infiltrate corporate networks through phishing and malware for the purposes of data exfiltration and financial fraud.
