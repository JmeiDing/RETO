The document describes the discovery and analysis of a new Android banking trojan botnet called Geost. The botnet was discovered accidentally when the authors were analyzing network traffic from another malware called HtBot. HtBot turns infected machines into private proxies that can be rented out by cybercriminals. The authors were running HtBot samples in their lab and monitoring the traffic. They noticed suspicious patterns of traffic going to bank-related domains, which turned out to be from the previously unknown Geost botnet. The Geost botmasters had made multiple operational security mistakes that allowed the researchers to uncover details about the botnet: - Using the HtBot network, which was being monitored, to relay their C&C traffic - Not encrypting C&C communications - Re-using the same proxy network multiple times - Trusting a developer group with poor OpSec that leaked a chat log - Failing to encrypt chat logs that contained sensitive info Through pivoting and threat hunting techniques, the researchers uncovered the scale of the Geost operation: - 13+ C&C servers - 800,000+ victims, mostly in Russia - 150+ malicious APK files for distribution - Over 100 domains - Potential access to millions of Euros from victims' bank accounts The botnet stole extensive personal data from victims including SMS messages, bank balances, names, addresses, and more. It specifically targeted major Russian banks. Analysis of a leaked chat log provided insights into the social relationships between the botnet operators and associated underground group of 29 developers. Real names were uncovered for several group members. In summary, the discovery of Geost demonstrates how poor operational security can allow researchers to unveil extensive details about even large-scale malware operations. The analysis provides comprehensive information about the botnet infrastructure, scale, victims, targeted banks, and involved attackers.
