The document analyzes an information stealing malware called Sayad (also known as Flying Kitten). Sayad is distributed via phishing emails and implemented as a .NET DLL component that collects sensitive user and system data. It is suspected to be developed by an Iranian hacking group Ajax Security Team. The main entry point of the Sayad Client initializes and starts up all data collection methods that the assembly implements. The Sayad Client uses a very trivial method for uploading the encrypted user and host data to the malicious server. Communication with the C2 server is limited to transferring collected data from the user and the host to the C2 server. The PDF provides an overview of Sayad's capabilities, which include collecting system info, keylogging, screenshots, browser data, chat logs, VPN accounts, etc. Technical analysis is provided on Sayad's components - a self-extracting executable, binder executable, and the Sayad client DLL. The binder checks .NET versions, drops the DLL, and launches it using rundll32.exe. The DLL exfiltrates data encrypted with an RSA public key to a command server. Network traffic analysis shows data being sent to a server at IP 107.6.182.179 registered to domain microsofts.com. While Sayad doesn't use advanced obfuscation, it leverages .NET DLLs and rundll32.exe to hide malicious activity. YARA rules are provided for detection. The malware appears active at the time of analysis with operational command infrastructure.
