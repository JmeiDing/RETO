The document analyzes supply chain attacks targeting the gaming industry in Asia attributed to the Winnti group. The attackers compromised game developers and inserted backdoors into games before distribution. Three cases are examined where games included the same backdoor code using a similar embedding method. The payload is decrypted and launched early in execution before the game code runs. The backdoor sends system info to a command and control server and can download additional executables or commands. C2 domains impersonate gaming companies and redirect to attacker servers. Language checks are performed to avoid targeting Russia/China. Victims are predominantly in Asia, especially Thailand. Second stage malware Winnti is also delivered via this backdoor. Attackers likely aimed to create a large botnet through the supply chain compromise. While two affected products were updated, one developer still distributes the compromised game Infestation. The attacks require compromising developer build environments and inserting trojanized code rather than modifying source code. This highlights the risk of supply chain attacks where relying on vendor trust can lead to mass malware distribution.
