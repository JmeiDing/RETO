The PDF analyzes an attack by the threat group APT-C-60 on targets in South Korea in 2022. The targets included a representative of the Hanns Seidel Foundation, Dr. Bernhard Seliger, as well as politicians related to the 2022 Pyeongchang Peace Forum. The attacks took place in two waves - spear-phishing emails sent in early February 2022 targeting the politicians, and another spear-phishing attack in mid-June 2022 targeting Dr. Seliger. Both used malicious LNK files to download a multi-stage malware payload. The payloads used public cloud storage sites like Bitbucket as well as the group's own infrastructure for command and control. The malware involved a downloader, a persistence module, and a full remote access trojan with capabilities like file exfiltration, screenshot capture, and arbitrary command execution. ThreatBook's analysis identified multiple associated indicators of compromise, including IP addresses, domain names, and file hashes. These can be used to detect APT-C-60's activities and attacks. The report concludes the malware shares code similarities with previous APT-C-60 attacks, further confirming attribution. In summary, the report provides an in-depth analysis of a recent spear-phishing campaign by the threat actor APT-C-60 against South Korean targets in 2022. It identifies the attack waves, payloads, infrastructure, and associated IOCs, providing valuable threat intelligence on the group's latest tactics, techniques, and procedures.
