The report from Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs details the evolution of a custom malware framework called Soul, used by an unknown threat actor to conduct espionage campaigns in Southeast Asia since 2017. The earliest versions of the malware combined code from open-source tools like Gh0st RAT with custom modifications. By 2018, the malware had been redeveloped into a more sophisticated modular framework called SoulSearcher, which loads encrypted payloads from the registry. Multiple versions of the SoulSearcher loader have been observed, with progressively more complex configurations and support for multiple payloads. Payloads include backdoor modules with remote shell and file transfer capabilities, keyloggers, and proxy tools. Throughout the development of the framework, the authors have added custom obfuscation techniques, expanded capabilities, increased modularity, and improved code quality. This demonstrates the resources and tradecraft of a competent, likely state-sponsored threat actor. While the identity of the group is unknown, the report provides extensive technical analysis on the inner workings of the malware, including encryption schemes, command and control protocols, payload structures, and configuration formats. Fortinet has implemented detections for the malware in its security products. The report provides IOCs and MITRE ATT&CK mappings that help defenders hunt for infections by this advanced threat actor.
