The report describes an advanced persistent threat (APT) group named DarkUniverse or the 27th function, linked to the ItaDuke cyberespionage activities. It was active from 2009-2017. The malware uses Spear phishing to spread itself and requires victims to open an attached Microsoft Office document. The most functional component of the DarkUniverse framework is dfrgntfs5.sqt, which processes commands from the C2 server and performs various tasks such as taking screenshots, injecting shellcode into browsers, collecting information from the registry, and decrypting credentials from various email clients. The infection chain involved multiple stages. The initial doc would drop a downloader and malicious modules. The main module communicated with command-and-control servers on cloud storage to receive commands and exfiltrate data. Additional modules performed keylogging, password stealing, and extensive surveillance of the system. DarkUniverse used evolving malware that was continuously updated throughout its operational period. Earlier versions from 2009 are very different from later ones. Its framework contained diverse capabilities like screenshot capturing, process injection, password dumping, network scanning, credential theft, and more. Over 20 victims were observed across countries like Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Tanzania, Russia and more. They spanned civilian and military organizations. The true number is likely much higher given the 8 years of activity. Technical details are provided on the encryption schemes, command and control, registry manipulation, and module functions. IOCs and YARA rules are available to Kaspersky customers. DarkUniverse exemplifies the full lifecycle of a sophisticated cyberespionage operation. The motives appear to be intelligence gathering and surveillance. Its ties to ItaDuke point to a well-resourced actor. The 2017 leak of hacking tools may have contributed to its shutdown. Defenders should monitor for resurgence using the provided technical indicators.
