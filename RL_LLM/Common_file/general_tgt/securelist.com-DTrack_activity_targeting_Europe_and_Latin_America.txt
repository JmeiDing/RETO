The report discusses recent activity of the DTrack backdoor used by the Lazarus cybercrime group. DTrack allows attackers to upload/download files and execute commands on compromised systems. The backdoor is used against various targets, including financial environments, nuclear power plants, and targeted ransomware attacks. DTrack allows criminals to upload, download, start or delete files on the victim host and retrieve compromising information. DTrack unpacks its payload in multiple stages, using obfuscation and encryption techniques to hide the final payload. The configuration details for decryption are embedded in the executable. Recent versions add more stages before the final payload, using shellcode and process hollowing to launch the payload DLL into explorer.exe. Infrastructure analysis shows DTrack C2 domains following color+animal naming patterns. Victims detected span Europe, Latin America, and other regions, across sectors like education, manufacturing, government, and telecoms. The malware continues to be actively used by Lazarus since its discovery in 2019, with modifications mainly focused on evasion like API hashing. The victimology shows expanded targeting across the globe. Defenders should monitor for suspicious multi-stage loaders, obfuscated payloads, and process hollowing techniques to detect DTrack activity. Blocking the identified C2 domains can also impede attacks.
