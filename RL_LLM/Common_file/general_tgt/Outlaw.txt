The document analyzes the reemergence of a Linux crypto-mining botnet called Outlaw that is targeting European organizations. Outlaw uses the Shellbot malware which includes an IRC-based backdoor, SSH scanner, and XMRig miner. The initial infection starts with SSH brute-force attacks to gain access to Linux servers. Various scripts install the botnet components - the miner module in one folder, backdoor logic in another, and a multistage SSH bruteforcer in the third. The miner mines Monero cryptocurrency using configured pools. The backdoor is an IRC-based Perl Shellbot that communicates with a command and control server on port 443. The bruteforcer contains a scanner to build a list of potential SSH targets and a bruteforce module to break into them. Most targets are in the US, China, Germany and France. While Outlaw was first seen in 2018, there are similarities with an eastern European cybercrime group active since 2012 in tools and techniques. The report analyzes the malware components, installations scripts, configurations, protocols, and targets. It highlights the ongoing threat of evolving crypto-mining botnets like Outlaw infecting Linux servers for financial gain. In summary, the document provides a technical analysis of the reemerged Outlaw crypto-mining botnet campaign targeting European organizations through Linux server infections.
