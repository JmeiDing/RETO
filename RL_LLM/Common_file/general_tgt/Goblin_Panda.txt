The article analyzes two RTF malware documents that exploit CVE-2017-11882 to deliver a remote access trojan payload. The RTFs use the same exploitation techniques but deliver different payloads than past Goblin Panda activity targeting Vietnam officials. Analysis shows the payload is a version of the SisFader RAT, which uses anti-emulation and encryption techniques similar to past Goblin Panda malware. Infrastructure links the activity to Goblin Panda APT group and the SisFader RAT. The C2 domains resolve to IP addresses in Shanghai. Unlike past targeting of Vietnam, this campaign targeted Russian telecom firms pretending to be Russia's FSB intelligence agency. Goblin Panda has evolved their techniques from prior SisFader RAT analysis and continues to target telecom sectors aligned with intelligence collection goals. Indicators of compromise for the malware documents, C2 infrastructure, and RAT payload are provided. In summary, the post analyzes a Goblin Panda campaign distributing an updated version of the SisFader remote access trojan via exploitation of Russian telecom entities. It highlights the evolving techniques and targeting of this Chinese threat actor.
