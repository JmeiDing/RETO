The document discusses malware attacks targeting the Syrian opposition from 2013-2014 attributed to pro-government groups. A variety of Remote Access Trojans (RATs) were used including ShadowTech Rat, Xtreme Rat, NjRat, BitComet Rat, DarkComet Rat, and BlackShades Rat. The attacks rely heavily on social engineering, using fake security software, popular messaging apps, news stories, and activist databases to trick users into running malware. Domains impersonating security sites distribute malware installers bundled with legitimate software. Over 100 malware samples were collected. Older samples were simple RAT executables while newer ones have elaborate GUI elements to appear legitimate. Obfuscation techniques are used to avoid detection. Persistence is achieved by adding malware to startup folders and modifying registry keys. Data exfiltration and command and control occurs via IPs allocated to the state-owned Syrian Telecom Establishment. Some attacks also originate from Russia. The attacks have evolved from simple malware distribution to more sophisticated social engineering. The number of samples, level of organization, and coding techniques continue to advance over time. The report concludes pro-government groups are relentlessly spying on and compromising the Syrian opposition through targeted cyber attacks. Up-to-date antivirus, firewalls, and user awareness training are recommended.
