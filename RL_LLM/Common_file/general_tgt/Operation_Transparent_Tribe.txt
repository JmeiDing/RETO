The report describes a cyberespionage operation called Operation Transparent Tribe uncovered by Proofpoint researchers targeting Indian government and military organizations. The attackers sent spearphishing emails to Indian embassies with weaponized documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to drop a remote access trojan called MSIL/Crimson. Further analysis uncovered a fake blog targeting Indian military personnel that distributed additional malware like Crimson, njRAT, and others. The blog and email attacks were tied together by shared infrastructure and tactics. Crimson is a modular RAT that can keylog, steal browser credentials, exfiltrate documents, and more. The report provides in-depth technical analysis of Crimson and other tools like the Python-based Peppy RAT used by the attackers. It also examines the infrastructure ties between this activity and previous campaigns like Operation DeputyDog. While attribution is unclear, there are possible connections to Pakistan-based groups. The report concludes that cyberespionage groups continue to leverage strategic web compromises, weaponized documents, and custom malware like Crimson to target government and military victims. Sharing threat intelligence helps identify sophisticated actors like those behind Transparent Tribe and protect against future attacks.
