The report analyzes recent phishing campaigns targeting Ukraine attributed to the threat actor UAC-0056 (also known as UNC2589 and TA471). UAC-0056 leverages war-themed lures to distribute macro-laden Excel documents that drop malware. The macros download an executable that establishes persistence and executes obfuscated PowerShell scripts. The PowerShell stages ultimately install a Cobalt Strike beacon for remote access. UAC-0056 regularly updates its malware but retains certain tactics, techniques, and procedures. The report connects multiple phishing documents referencing humanitarian aid, job vacancies, and war statistics in Ukraine. Though the lures vary, code analysis reveals similarities in the VBA macros and infrastructure. Cobalt Strike payloads also contain consistent signatures, further tying the activity together. By thoroughly documenting UAC-0056's latest campaigns, the analysis aims to support Ukrainian defense efforts against this persistent threat actor. Ongoing tracking of the group's malware and infrastructure is key to detecting new attacks. The report demonstrates UAC-0056's reliance on social engineering and commodity malware to infiltrate sensitive targets amid the fog of war.
