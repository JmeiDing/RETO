The PDF describes research by Volexity into a new macOS malware variant named GIMMICK used by a Chinese threat actor group called Storm Cloud. GIMMICK was found on a compromised MacBook Pro through memory forensics. GIMMICK uses Google Drive for command and control. It decodes credentials and configuration during initialization to connect to a unique folder for the infected host. Asynchronous task management is handled in Objective C using Apple's Grand Central Dispatch. The implant runs scheduled tasks to check for and process commands uploaded as encrypted files to Google Drive. Supported commands include system info collection, file upload/download, shell command execution, and config updates. Results are encrypted and exfiltrated back to the C2. The malware exhibits operational security by only communicating on weekdays during working hours. Customization of the file name and path blend it into the target's system. Prior Windows versions written in .NET and Delphi share infrastructure and behaviors with the macOS variant. Attribution is made to the Chinese group Storm Cloud based on prior encounters with GIMMICK. The porting of the malware to macOS and use of public cloud hosting show sophisticated tradecraft. Recommendations for detection and prevention are provided. In summary, the report analyzes a previously undocumented macOS backdoor used in targeted intrusions by a persistent, adept Chinese threat actor group to maintain long-term access to victims.
