The document analyzes a new malware variant called IHEATE, which is related to the IXESHE cyberespionage campaign. IHEATE has been observed targeting users in the United States, a shift from IXESHE's previous focus on East Asia and Germany. IHEATE shares some similarities with IXESHE but also has differences in its command and control (C&C) communication methods and encryption. It gathers system information from victims and communicates with C&C servers via TCP instead of HTTP. Technical analysis of an IHEATE sample shows it uses a hardcoded encryption key, random generated key, and RC4 encryption. Some variants use asymmetric encryption. It pretends to be a legitimate Media Player DLL file. IHEATE reuses domains from past IXESHE campaigns, suggesting overlap between the groups. The attackers compromise legitimate websites to use as C&C servers. In one case, a fake C&C address was planted as misdirection. The IHEATE activity shows IXESHE continues to evolve its tactics, techniques, and procedures. It remains an active threat, now expanding its targeting to the United States in addition to East Asia and Europe. The report aims to document the new IHEATE malware and its links to the broader IXESHE cyberespionage campaign.
