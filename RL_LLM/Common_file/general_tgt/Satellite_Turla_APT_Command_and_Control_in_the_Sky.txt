The document discusses how advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like Turla (also called Snake or Uroboros) use satellite internet links to mask their command and control infrastructure from takedowns. Turla is a sophisticated Russian-linked cyberespionage group active since 2007. They stand out for their use of satellite internet links to anonymize their C2 servers, making it hard to identify the operators or physically locate the hardware. Turla exploits unencrypted downstream satellite internet links by using just a satellite dish, DVB-S tuner, and Linux PC to hijack the traffic. They listen for packets to satellite IP ranges, spoof responses back to senders, while the legitimate user ignores them. This allows Turla to hide C2 servers in satellite ranges across the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. The links are kept up for months but cycled regularly. The method requires minimal investment compared to purchasing full satellite links, but provides high anonymity. The document provides technical details on how Turla implements the attacks and notes concerns this could become more widespread among APTs. IOCs and mitigation advice are included.
