Symantec analyzed a sophisticated malware called Seaduke used in targeted cyberespionage attacks. Seaduke is part of the "Duke" family of malware tools used by an advanced threat actor. Other tools include CozyDuke and MiniDuke. The group has been active since at least 2010, targeting government and diplomatic entities. Seaduke is reserved for high-value targets and used alongside CozyDuke for stealthy data exfiltration. The malware uses multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation to avoid detection. It has highly configurable capabilities. CozyDuke can install Seaduke via commands from the attacker's infrastructure. Seaduke C2 is separate. Seaduke features include system reconnaissance, file operations, self-deletion, and specialized payloads. The report speculates on the group's future plans to rework tools and infrastructure to continue long-term cyberespionage campaigns.
