The document describes the discovery of new cyberattacks in 2015 that appear similar to the 2013 Dark Seoul/Operation Troy campaign originating from South Korea. Dark Seoul involved widespread wiper malware that destroyed hard drives and sought military intelligence. The new attacks target the transportation and logistics sector in Europe using trojanized installation files that also infect systems. Analysis suggests the malware is nearly identical to the original Dark Seoul tools in structure and functionality, including a custom base64 alphabet and string decryption routine found in the old malware. The command and control servers are compromised websites in South Korea and Europe. While the targeting is different than Dark Seoul which focused on South Korea military and financial sectors, the tactics have strong similarities indicating the same threat actor groups may be responsible. After public exposure in 2013, the groups went dormant which is common. The re-emergence after 2 years with modified tools and infrastructure shows intent to continue previous activities with adjustments to avoid detection. The motivation for restarting cyber espionage against different targets is unclear. Ongoing monitoring has not revealed destructive capabilities yet. The malware's ability to download additional components leaves the full scope undiscovered. The summary suggests a concerning revival of previous state-sponsored cyberattacks against new targets, leveraging known TTPs but with adaptations to the malware and infrastructure.
