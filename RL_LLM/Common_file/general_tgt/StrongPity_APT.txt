The PDF document details an investigation by Bitdefender into the StrongPity cyberespionage group, also known as Promethium. StrongPity is a threat actor that has been active since at least 2012 conducting surveillance and intelligence gathering. The group targets victims in the Middle East and Europe, particularly those in Turkey and Syria. The investigation reveals that StrongPity uses watering hole attacks to infect targets by providing malicious installers from compromised websites. The installers contain malware and are signed with self-signed certificates to appear legitimate. The malware contains an encryption key that changes for each campaign but key lengths remain the same, suggesting an organized developer team. The installers were all compiled during normal working hours, further indicative of a paid team. The malware communicates with multi-layered command and control infrastructure to hide its tracks. Bitdefender mapped 47 servers used across downloader, command and control, and proxy servers. Most victims reside near the Turkey-Syria border and in Istanbul, suggesting the group's interest in the Kurdish population amid regional conflicts. The report also includes indicators of compromise such as file hashes, IP addresses, and domain names associated with StrongPity. In summary, the report provides extensive technical details on StrongPity's tactics, infrastructure, and targets revealed through Bitdefender's thorough investigation of the cyberespionage group. It sheds light on the inner workings and regional interests of the persistent threat actor.
