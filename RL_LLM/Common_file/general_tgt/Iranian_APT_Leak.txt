The document appears to be a leaked report from 2019 by an Israeli cybersecurity firm ClearSky analyzing leaked documents from Iranian state-sponsored hacking groups. The leaks expose attack tools, infrastructure, and plans of Iranian groups like OilRig, MuddyWater, and an unknown group called Rana. The leaks likely significantly harm the groups' operations. The leaked documents detail plans to hack airlines to gather intelligence on flights, passengers, crews, executives, systems, and finances. Specific airlines targeted include Ethiopian Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, and Israir. Other targets in Israel include insurance companies, hotel booking websites like Israelhotels.org, and the agriculture ministry. Attacks aimed to steal customer data and credit cards. The Rana documents show the group's goals include tracking Iranians domestically and abroad, spreading Islamic culture, cyber warfare, and gathering intelligence. Rana has specialized teams for developing malware, mobile hacking, web attacks, and networks. There are also attack plans and intelligence gathered on entities in countries like Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, and others. An attack on Kuwait's foreign ministry used phishing and spear phishing to gain access to systems and data. One IRGC document details "Project 910" to develop malware targeting SCADA systems, though as of 2016 it was reportedly unsuccessful. Overall, the leaks expose the tools, techniques, infrastructure, and targeting of Iranian groups in cyber espionage and potential sabotage operations worldwide, especially against airlines and Israel. The leaks likely set back these groups' capabilities.
