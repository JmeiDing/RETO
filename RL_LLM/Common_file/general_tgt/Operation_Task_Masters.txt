The report describes cyberespionage campaigns conducted by a threat actor group named TaskMasters uncovered by Positive Technologies in 2018. The group has targeted over 30 organizations across various industries in multiple countries, with a focus on stealing confidential documents and data. The group establishes long-term stealthy presence on victim networks, moving laterally using a tool called AtNow to run commands on remote hosts. They use small backdoors like RemShell for command and control. The backdoors communicate with C2 servers encrypted with RC4 and Base64. The group also makes use of web shells for backup access. The report provides an in-depth analysis of the custom tools used by TaskMasters, including backdoors, credential stealers, traffic redirectors, and other utilities. It also lists publicly available tools leveraged by the group such as Mimikatz and ASPXSpy web shell. While some evidence suggests the group may be Chinese-based, the report notes that attribution is difficult and threat actors increasingly utilize shared infrastructure and tools. The report concludes that organizations across sectors face advanced cyberespionage threats, and need skilled security teams to detect attacks and implement protections. Sharing threat intelligence is also key to identify and defend against sophisticated actors like TaskMasters.
