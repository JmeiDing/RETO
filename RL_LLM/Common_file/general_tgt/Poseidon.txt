The PDF describes a targeted cyberattack group called Poseidon that has been active since at least 2005 targeting companies globally. Poseidon is the first Portuguese-speaking threat actor discovered. Poseidon uses spear-phishing emails with malware-laden Office docs that install custom backdoors on victim systems. Their toolkit focuses on gathering information and lateral movement within networks to access confidential data. A key tool is the IGT supertool that orchestrates info gathering, exfiltration, and cleanup. The group heavily customizes its malware for each target. They aggressively explore domain networks to map resources and compromise things like domain controllers. The main goal is to steal intellectual property, technologies, and business-sensitive data. Poseidon has a unique extortion element where they blackmail companies to contract them as a security firm, while still maintaining persistence to continue stealing data. The group shows a deep knowledge of Windows internals for lateral movement. Though individually detected over the years, researchers finally connected the campaigns to the single Poseidon actor. Known victims span many industries and are concentrated in Brazil, the US, France, and other countries. The PDF provides IOCs and recommendations for detection.
