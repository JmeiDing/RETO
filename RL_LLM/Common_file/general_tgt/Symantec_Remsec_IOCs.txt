The Remsec malware is a sophisticated framework that provides attackers with complete control over infected computers. It uses multiple components that work together to spread across networks, communicate with command and control servers, and deploy custom tools. The main loader component loads encrypted executable files from disk and executes them. These executable blobs contain the malware payloads. The loader uses RC5 and RSA encryption to decrypt the blobs. It also logs activity which is encrypted and saved. Various Lua-based modules provide capabilities like keylogging, network communications, and loading additional plugins. A module named "Sauron" performs keylogging and exfiltrates the data. Other modules like "ilpsend" and "updater" are used for C2 communications and updating the malware. The malware uses multiple techniques to listen for commands on the network - ICMP, raw sockets, PCAP sniffing etc. It looks for encrypted network traffic and decrypts it to extract commands and additional executable code. There are different variants with named pipe or HTTP based command and control. The HTTP variant uses compromised websites with PHP scripts to communicate. It can perform UAC bypass techniques to gain admin access on infected hosts. The modular framework allows deploying custom tools on demand. The report contains IOCs like hashes, network signatures, and Yara rules to detect the malware. It tracks the operation of this malware since at least 2016 and provides an analysis of its capabilities based on observed samples. The malware appears to be actively used in targeted attacks against organizations. In summary, Remsec is a sophisticated, stealthy malware framework that provides extensive control over compromised hosts to carry out cyber espionage and data exfiltration. The modular architecture and encryption makes it challenging to analyze and detect.
