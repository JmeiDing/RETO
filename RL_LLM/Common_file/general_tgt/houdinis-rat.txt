The PDF discusses the capabilities and recent activity of a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) malware called H-W0rm (also known as Hworm). H-W0rm gives attackers remote access and control over infected computers. Some key points: H-W0rm has classic RAT capabilities like collecting system info, file manager, keylogger, webcam/microphone access, etc. It allows adversaries to fully control infected systems. Research suggests the developer "Houdini" may have connections to the developer of other RATs like njRAT and BlackWorm. The PDF provides a list of over 100 Hworm command and control domains that were active in infections over the past 6 months. Many domains overlap with other RATs like XtremeRAT. The PDF includes Yara rules to detect Hworm and also enriches the Fidelis Barncat database with new Hworm configurations to aid security researchers. Hworm versions have been seen avoiding detection by antivirus tools installed on victim machines, like Microsoft Security Essentials. The PDF provides technical analysis into Hworm's capabilities and builder tool, showing how it can be customized for different campaigns. Videos demonstrate the builder interface. Hworm is seen across enterprise verticals globally, making it one of the most active RATs. The PDF aims to provide intel to security teams to help detect and stop this threat.
