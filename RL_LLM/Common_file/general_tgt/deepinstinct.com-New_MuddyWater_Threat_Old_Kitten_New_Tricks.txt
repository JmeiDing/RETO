The document discusses recent activity by an Iranian cyberespionage group called MuddyWater, also known as Static Kitten and Mercury. MuddyWater has been active since at least 2017, targeting organizations in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. MuddyWater is using phishing emails containing links or attachments leading to archives hosting legitimate remote administration tools like ScreenConnect and Syncro. The tools are abused to gain persistent access and enable further malicious actions. A new campaign was observed starting September 2022, introducing updated tactics from previous MuddyWater campaigns. This includes using Syncro instead of ScreenConnect, new phishing lures like HTML attachments, and additional file hosting providers beyond OneHub. The phishing emails impersonate legitimate companies to target victims in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, Tajikistan, and the United Arab Emirates. The emails have poor grammar and formatting. Once installed, Syncro provides the threat actor full remote control of compromised systems including file exfiltration, lateral movement, and deployment of additional payloads. MuddyWater sets up new Syncro instances for each phishing email. The report aims to make security teams aware of this latest campaign abusing legitimate tools like Syncro for malicious operations. Monitoring for unfamiliar remote access solutions can help detect threat actor activity.
