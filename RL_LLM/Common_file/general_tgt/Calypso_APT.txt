The document describes an advanced persistent threat (APT) group named Calypso that has been active since at least September 2016. Calypso targets government institutions in several countries, including Brazil, India, Kazakhstan, Russia, Thailand, and Turkey, with the goal of stealing confidential data. The report provides an analysis of the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by Calypso. The group typically gains initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities or guessing default credentials to upload a web shell. They then use publicly available tools like Mimikatz for lateral movement and credential access. Custom malware like Calypso RAT, PlugX, and a modified Byeby trojan are deployed on compromised hosts for command and control. Detailed analysis is provided on the Calypso RAT malware, including its dropper, installation script, shellcode, commands, modules, and network communication. Variants using different payloads like Hussar and FlyingDutchman are also examined. Evidence suggests the Calypso group originates from Asia, based on IP addresses traced back to China Telecom, artifacts in scripts and configuration files, and the use of PlugX malware associated with Asian APTs. Links to the SongXY group are noted but inconclusive. The report concludes with indicators of compromise and maps Calypso's tactics to the MITRE ATT&CK framework technique IDs. In summary, Calypso is an active, stealthy threat group that continues to target government institutions to steal confidential data using custom malware and tactics.
