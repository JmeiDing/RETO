The PDF describes an analysis by Fidelis Cybersecurity of a malware campaign called INOCNATION. The malware uses a remote access trojan (RAT) that employs various techniques to evade detection and analysis, including: Obfuscating components with XOR encryption. Using a signed Cisco software installer as a decoy. Detecting sandbox environments. Mangling the MZ header to avoid detection. Stacking and encrypting strings to hide commands and URLs. Encrypting C2 traffic over HTTPS. The RAT can receive commands for actions like executing processes, transferring files, and uninstalling itself. It uses a legitimate signed Cisco binary as a decoy to avoid suspicion. It looks for mouse movements to detect sandboxes. The mangled header, string encryption, and HTTPS hiding are meant to evade analysis and detection. The RAT has evolved through multiple versions named Comet, Stardust, and Meteor. It was used in attacks on companies in Syria tied to Iran in 2019-2020. The attackers are a politically motivated group calling itself Indra. In July 2021, a similar attack was conducted against Iran's railway and transportation agencies. While not claimed, Fidelis believes it was also conducted by Indra due to tactical and technical similarities. The report concludes these non-state actors have sophisticated capabilities equivalent to state-sponsored groups. Similar attacks could occur globally.
