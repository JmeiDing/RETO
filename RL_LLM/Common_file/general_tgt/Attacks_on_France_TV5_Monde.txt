In April 2015, the French TV network TV5Monde was attacked, disrupting 11 channels. The "Cyber Caliphate" hacker group claimed responsibility.The attack took control of the network's broadcast system and social media accounts. Negligent security practices like exposed passwords likely aided the attack. Analysis found the malware was a variant of NjRAT/Njworm which originated in the Middle East and has many Arabic language tutorials. The malware was a VBScript backdoor generated by a source code builder. It steals system info and allows remote control. The backdoor communicates with a C&C server to receive commands. It also extracts and exfiltrates system and user information. TV networks are prime targets for politically motivated attacks. They need to urgently improve security and be aware of regional malware threats.
