The document analyzes a phishing campaign attributed to the Lazarus cybercrime group targeting engineering and defense contractor job candidates in the US and Europe. The attack starts with weaponized Word documents containing macros that download and execute malware. Multiple iterations of documents were observed, with increasing sophistication to evade detection. Techniques include concealing executable headers, reporting execution status to C2 servers, renaming utilities like Certutil, and direct payload execution. The payloads gather system info and download additional tools. Attribution is based on TTP overlaps with prior Lazarus activity, including document macros, compromised infrastructure, encoded C2 communications, and targeting of job roles. The attacks demonstrate Lazarus' continued innovation to compromise targets and maintain persistence aligned with North Korean interests. Defensive recommendations include implementing the provided Suricata rules, YARA rules, and ATT&CK detection mappings. Ongoing monitoring of Lazarus' TTP evolution can enable rapid detection and remediation of new activity.
