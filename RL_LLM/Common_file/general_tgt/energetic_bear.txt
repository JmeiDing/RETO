Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF: The PDF describes attacks conducted by an APT group called Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti against various companies and organizations worldwide. The group's main tactics involve sending phishing emails with malicious documents and infecting servers to use in watering hole attacks. The PDF provides details on compromised servers used by the group, including victims' countries, industries, and the servers' roles in the attacks. Victims include companies in sectors like energy, industrial, aerospace, finance, and more across countries including Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Greece, Germany, UK, and US. The servers were compromised in a similar way, by injecting links that initiate SMB protocol connections to steal authentication data like usernames and password hashes. The compromised servers were then used to scan and fingerprint other resources that could be future victims. The group utilizes publicly available hacking tools like nmap, dirsearch, sqlmap, etc. They also use custom web shells and modified ssh binaries with backdoors for persistence and remote access. The report concludes that the group likely takes orders from external customers and collects initial data or authentication material to enable further attacks. It details indicators of compromise like file paths, PHP web shells, and Yara rules to detect this group's activities.
