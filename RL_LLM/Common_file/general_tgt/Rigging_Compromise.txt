The PDF analyzes the RIG exploit kit which compromises users by redirecting them to malicious websites containing exploits. RIG appeared in 2013 and is still active, though less widespread than kits like Angler. It lures victims via iframes injected into legitimate sites and malvertising. The landing page probes the browser for vulnerabilities and delivers exploits, like a Flash exploit. The payload is downloaded separately. Payloads pose as legitimate Windows services but are dropped in temp folders. Analysis over 2 months shows RIG used domain shadowing with short random subdomains on over 7000 domains. Users were referred via Google, Bing and 60 other sites, indicating redirected traffic. RIG delivered spambot payloads, unlike most kits delivering ransomware. Payloads were detected by antivirus but still infected users. 44 IP addresses linked to RIG were almost all assigned to a Russian provider Eurobyte via upstream provider Webzilla. Webzilla blocked malicious hosts when notified but Eurobyte did not respond. Further research on Eurobyte's 25,000 hosted domains showed most negatively rated for reputation. Talos and OpenDNS blacklisted Eurobyte's 5 suspect subnets for 30 days to protect customers. The analysis highlights that exploit kits like RIG continue to successfully compromise users despite not being highly sophisticated. Lack of response from some hosting providers also enables these threats.
