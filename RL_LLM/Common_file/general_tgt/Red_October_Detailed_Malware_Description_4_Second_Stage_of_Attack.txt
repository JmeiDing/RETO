The PDF provides additional details on the second stage modules used in the Red October malware attack. It covers modules for persistence, spreading, and data exfiltration. The persistence modules ensure the malware continues running on infected systems. This includes a scheduler that runs tasks, installs plugins in Microsoft Office/Adobe Reader to re-infect systems if cleaned, and a lightweight backdoor module. Spreading modules scan for vulnerable systems and use exploits like MS08-067 to infect them. They can spread via passwords stolen from the system and through accessible network shares. One module targets Cisco devices. Exfiltration modules gather data and send it to command and control servers. They collect files, registry data, Outlook emails, etc. and encrypt this data before sending it out. Some modules are one-time executed for specific tasks while others persist for long-term access. The modular approach allows the attackers to deploy only needed modules. The malware avoids writing data locally and executes from memory where possible. In summary, the second stage Red October modules provide persistence, lateral movement through the network, and data exfiltration, building on the reconnaissance of the initial infection vector. The multi-stage modular approach makes this a highly configurable and customizable attack.
