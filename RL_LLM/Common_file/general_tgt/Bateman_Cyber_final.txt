The paper examines the military effectiveness of Russia's wartime cyber operations in Ukraine. It finds that Russian cyber attacks have had negligible impact on the war's strategic outcome. Cyber "fires" (disruptive/destructive attacks) contributed modestly during the initial invasion but quickly faded in relevance as kinetic fighting intensified. While the Viasat satellite hack likely degraded some Ukrainian communications, most Russian cyber fires targeted civilian networks and caused limited real-world disruption. Intelligence collection has likely been Russia's main cyber focus, but this too yielded little military benefit due to weaknesses in Russia's intelligence analysis, planning, and decision-making processes. Overall, inadequate Russian cyber capacity, non-cyber institutional deficits, exceptional Ukrainian and foreign defensive efforts, and the sheer scale of conventional fighting constrained Moscowâ€™s cyber impact. Looking ahead, Russian intelligence collection still poses the greatest cyber risk to Ukraine, for example by tracking high-value targets or revealing sensitive information through hack-and-leak operations. Other militaries should learn from Russia's experience but avoid overgeneralizing; effective cyber operations depend heavily on the specifics of each war. Cyber defenders should reexamine assumptions about enemies' cyber capabilities in light of Russia's challenges in Ukraine.
