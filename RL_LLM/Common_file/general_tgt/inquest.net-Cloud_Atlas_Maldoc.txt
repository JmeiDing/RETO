The PDF describes analysis of a malicious Excel document that was being used in a phishing campaign impersonating the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The document purported to request data from Russian clients and contained a visual lure image to make it look legitimate. When opened, the Excel document retrieves and executes a second stage payload from a URL that points to a zip file containing an MSI installer. The MSI installer contains legitimate files to evade detection as well as a malicious DLL that is installed on the victim's machine. The DLL phones home to a remote C2 server controlled by the threat actor group Cloud Atlas. Cloud Atlas has been active since 2014 targeting government organizations and the aerospace industry using document-based malware. This campaign leveraged current events around the Russia/Ukraine war and sanctions on Russian banks to make the phishing document seem relevant and increase likelihood of targets opening it. The initial Excel document and MSI installer had low antivirus detection rates when analyzed. In summary, this document provides technical analysis of a phishing campaign by the Cloud Atlas group, using a malicious Excel document to infect targets with a malware DLL that could be used for further infiltration and data exfiltration. The campaign masqueraded as official communication related to sanctions on Russia.
