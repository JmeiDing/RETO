The data is encrypted and encoded. - The malware tracks infections via campaign IDs and logs system info like IP, OS, and machine name. It uses social engineering and fake files to avoid detection. - The coding techniques are basic and bugs exist, indicating amateur developers. But the campaign has still successfully compromised many targets. - Non-working features suggest the ability to generate new malware executables was being developed. The malware continues to be active and monitored. - While unsophisticated, the malware is effective at stealing data from infected systems. Low-tech malware remains a threat and this campaign in particular has had high success rates despite its simplicity. In summary, the document analyzes an active, low-tech but effective malware campaign targeting the Middle East that is stealing data from compromised systems.
