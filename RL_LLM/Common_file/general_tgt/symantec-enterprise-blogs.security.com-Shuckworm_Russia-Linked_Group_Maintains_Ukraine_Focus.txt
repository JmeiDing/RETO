The document describes recent activity by a Russia-linked hacking group called Shuckworm (also known as Gamaredon or Armageddon) that appears to be targeting Ukraine with information-stealing malware. The activity was observed by Symantec starting on July 15, 2022 and is consistent with previous activity reported by CERT-UA on July 26. The infection starts with a self-extracting 7-Zip file downloaded via the browser, which then downloads an XML file masquerading as an HTML app. The XML file executes a PowerShell stealer, with multiple versions deployed likely to evade detection. Other tools used include Backdoor.Pterodo scripts and Giddome backdoors. A 4896.exe backdoor is also dropped that can record audio, take screenshots, log keystrokes, and download/execute other malware. Legitimate remote access tools like Ammyy Admin and AnyDesk are also leveraged. The domain a0698649.xsph[.]ru was used for the initial infection and is associated with previous Shuckworm campaigns. Email spoofing Ukraine's security service was likely used to deliver the initial 7-zip file. A variety of other network IOCs, command lines, and payloads are listed. Shuckworm has focused almost exclusively on Ukraine since 2014 and is considered a state-sponsored Russian espionage group. Despite public exposure, the group persists in targeting Ukrainian organizations, compensating for lack of sophistication with focus and persistence. Protecting against the group involves using updated antivirus tools, network monitoring, employee training, and other standard security practices.
