The PDF describes research by Check Point on a new campaign by a Chinese threat actor targeting the Mongolian public sector. The attackers are using COVID-19 themed documents written in Mongolian to distribute malware. The documents contain exploits for Microsoft Word that drop a malicious DLL into the Word startup folder for persistence. The DLL then reaches out to the attacker's servers to download additional payloads. The payloads observed include reconnaissance capabilities and a remote access trojan (RAT). Analysis of the infrastructure used in this campaign reveals links to previous activity by the same group dating back to at least 2016. The group has targeted different sectors across multiple countries including Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and Mongolia. Attribution is made to a known Chinese group based on code similarities between the RAT payload observed here and the BYEBY RAT described in prior reporting. Additional connections are made based on infrastructure reuse and unique logging strings. In summary, this represents an ongoing campaign by a sophisticated Chinese threat actor leveraging topical COVID-19 themes to distribute reconnaissance malware and RATs to victims in Mongolia and likely other regions. The group has a history spanning several years of targeting different sectors across Asia and Eastern Europe.
