The report describes a point-of-sale (PoS) malware threat named FastPOS that is designed to quickly steal credit card information. FastPOS is installed via compromised websites, file sharing services, or direct transfer using stolen credentials. It copies itself to system folders and adds persistence mechanisms. FastPOS has three threads for keylogging, RAM scraping, and self-updating. The keylogger captures all keystrokes, while the RAM scraper searches memory for track data and sends it to the command and control (C&C) server. An algorithm checks card numbers for validity before exfiltration. Unlike most PoS malware, FastPOS uses HTTP GET requests rather than POST to exfiltrate data. This exposes the stolen card data in plaintext on the network and in browser cache. The C&C server URLs are hardcoded in the malware. Analysis uncovered links between FastPOS and a cybercriminal forum where stolen cards are sold. Infections have been observed globally, especially in countries with remote access to PoS systems. Cards from various countries are for sale on a site linked to FastPOS C&C IPs. FastPOS shows attackers are refining PoS malware with faster exfiltration routines that blend into normal traffic by abusing HTTP GET. Proper network segmentation, endpoint control, and threat detection solutions can help businesses mitigate the risk of PoS malware like FastPOS.
