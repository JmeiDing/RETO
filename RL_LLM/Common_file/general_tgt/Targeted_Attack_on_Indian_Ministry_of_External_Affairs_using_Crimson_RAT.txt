The PDF discusses a targeted spear phishing attack observed by Volon's research team in early August 2018 against officials at the Indian Ministry of External Affairs. The attack used Crimson RAT malware and exhibited TTPs tied to a threat actor active since 2016 known as Operation Transparent Tribe. The attack started with an email lure claiming to contain a training schedule, asking the victim to download an Excel file from a fake gov domain that actually contained macro code. The macro dropped an initial Crimson RAT downloader payload which then retrieved the full RAT from an IP address. Volon found a similar document from early August fetching the payload from the same domain identified in previous Operation Transparent Tribe attacks. The initial payload drops the RAT executable, establishes persistence, kills processes, parses C2 commands, and facilitates further capabilities like keylogging and stealing browser credentials. Based on the TTP and payload similarities, Volon concludes that the threat actor behind Operation Transparent Tribe is likely active again and targeting Indian government organizations. Indicators of compromise found are provided as well. The analysis gives insight into an ongoing targeted campaign abusing geopolitics to infect victims with feature-rich Crimson RAT.
