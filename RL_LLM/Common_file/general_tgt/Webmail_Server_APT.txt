The PDF describes an advanced persistent threat (APT) attack detected by Cybereason on a customer's Microsoft Outlook Web Application (OWA) server. The attackers installed a malicious OWAAUTH.DLL module that impersonated a legitimate DLL file. This module enabled the attackers to record user credentials and gain backdoor access to the server. The OWA server was an ideal target because it provided both internal access and external internet-facing access. By compromising it, the attackers could steal domain credentials and maintain persistent access. The malicious module intercepted HTTP requests and stole usernames/passwords of users logging into OWA. It encrypted and logged over 11,000 credentials. The module also had a remote access backdoor that allowed the attackers to execute code and SQL queries on the server and connected databases. This backdoor was triggered by a special HTTP request parameter unique to this customer. Cybereason detected the attack through its endpoint visibility and malware hunting engine. It provided the customer visibility into the full attack timeline and toolset. This allowed them to quickly remediate the compromised OWA server. Cybereason concludes that the attack demonstrates the risks of internet-facing services like OWA. It also shows the power of EDR tools to detect and respond to sophisticated, tailored attacks. Automated detection and analysis is key to rapidly finding and containing threats like this.
