The Magento ecommerce platform vendor Fishpig was hacked recently, resulting in malware being injected into their software extensions. Fishpig sells integrations between Magento and WordPress. The "Rekoobe" malware was inserted into Fishpig's paid extensions and distributed to customers through software updates since at least August 19, 2022. This means any Magento online stores that have installed or updated Fishpig extensions in the past few weeks are likely infected with the malware that grants attackers full admin access. The malware hides as a background process on infected servers waiting for commands from a command and control server located in Latvia. It's estimated over 200,000 Magento stores use Fishpig but it's unknown how many use the paid compromised extensions. Fishpig has confirmed the incident and recommended merchants upgrade/reinstall the extensions. Sansec, who discovered the hack, has updated their scanner to detect the malware and advised merchants to scan for unauthorized activity and restart their servers. The malware was found injected into Fishpig's Magento Security Suite and other extensions. It executes when admins visit the Fishpig control panel, downloading a Linux binary called lic.bin pretending to be a license file but is actually the Rekoobe malware. After launching, it hides itself and waits for commands to steal data or perform other malicious actions.
