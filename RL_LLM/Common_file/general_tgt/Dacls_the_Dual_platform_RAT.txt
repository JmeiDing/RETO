The PDF describes a new type of remote access trojan (RAT) malware called Dacls that targets both Windows and Linux systems. It is believed to be linked to the Lazarus Group based on code similarities with other malware attributed to this group. The software generates random IP addresses based on four built-in rules and attempts to connect to port 8291. Once connected, it performs a port scan without sending payload data, but only checks if the port is open. The software uses the Winbox protocol of MikroTik router devices, which works on TCP/8291 port and is exposed on the Internet. Dacls has a modular architecture and uses TLS and RC4 encryption for command and control communication. It can receive commands to execute system commands, manage files, kill processes, and more. It also has a reverse proxy plugin to hide direct connections to the command infrastructure. The malware authors likely used an exploit for the Confluence vulnerability CVE-2019-3396 to initially distribute Dacls. The exploit code and Dacls samples were found hosted on a suspected malware server domain. Technical details provided include the configuration file format, encryption techniques, command and control protocol structure, available plugins, and process for executing commands. Indicators of compromise are listed including MD5 hashes, IP addresses, and URLs related to Dacls. Recommendations include patching Confluence servers, monitoring for signs of Dacls infection, and blocking associated indicators of compromise. The threat actors behind Dacls appear sophisticated and utilize advanced techniques to avoid detection.
