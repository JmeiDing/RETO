The PDF describes updates to the toolkit of a threat actor group called Iron Tiger (also known as LuckyMouse and APT27). Iron Tiger conducts cyberespionage campaigns against targets in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Researchers found Iron Tiger has evolved its SysUpdate malware, now using 5 files instead of 3 in its infection routine. The new version includes an installer that decrypts the final payload and adds persistence mechanisms. SysUpdate features remote access, file exfiltration, and command execution. Iron Tiger also uses a kernel-mode rootkit called Pandora for hiding its activities. Pandora turns off security protections to load an unsigned driver. It intercepts traffic and communicates with a backdoor payload using an encrypted channel. The group continues using the HyperBro backdoor and Type 1 malware from previous campaigns. They added new features and infrastructure over time but core behaviors remain the same. Iron Tiger hacked a Philippines gambling company repeatedly over 18 months. Other tools used include the FRP proxy tool on Linux and a rootkit from GitHub for hiding files and processes. Iron Tiger targets telecom, energy, finance, and government entities beyond gambling. Their infection vectors include strategic web compromises and Microsoft Exchange exploits. In summary, the report provides an update on the sophisticated toolkit of the Iron Tiger APT group. It shows their persistence in re-compromising targets and expanding to new sectors/regions. Iron Tiger rapidly incorporates public code and evolves malware like SysUpdate over time.
