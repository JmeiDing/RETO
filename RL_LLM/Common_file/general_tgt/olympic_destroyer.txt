The PDF describes an attack campaign that disrupted the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The attackers used spear-phishing emails containing weaponized documents to target partners of the Olympics. If opened, the documents installed malware called OlympicDestroyer which spread through networks. OlympicDestroyer is a worm that collects credentials, installs backdoors, and has a wiper component to destroy data. It disrupted systems at the Olympics opening ceremony and affected ski resort infrastructure. The attribution of the attack has been controversial, with various claims made about Lazarus Group and Russian, Chinese, or North Korean APTs being responsible based on malware code similarities. However, the malware appears designed to mislead researchers and contains false flags. The rich header was forged to match Lazarus malware, but on analysis doesn't actually match the code. The attackers' TTPs also don't align with Lazarus or other attributed groups. The motives behind the attack remain unclear. It caused visible disruption but not widespread destructive damage. Possible motives include demonstrating capabilities, testing the worm, or experimenting with false flags to trick researchers and avoid attribution. In summary, the PDF describes the OlympicDestroyer campaign that disrupted the 2018 Winter Olympics using stealthy malware designed to misdirect blame to other threat actors. The sophisticated false flags show the increasing challenges of accurate threat attribution.
