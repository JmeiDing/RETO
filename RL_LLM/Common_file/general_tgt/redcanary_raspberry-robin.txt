The PDF describes an emerging threat cluster named Raspberry Robin by Red Canary. Raspberry Robin is malware often installed via USB drive that uses a worm to spread. Initial infection happens when the user connects the infected USB drive. A shortcut link file runs a command to execute another file that installs the worm. The worm uses msiexec.exe to communicate with compromised QNAP NAS devices for command and control. It sends the victim's hostname and username to its C2 server. Raspberry Robin uses mixed case commands and random strings to evade detection. It leverages living-off-the-land binaries like msiexec, rundll32, and odbcconf to proxy execution of its malicious payloads. A DLL is installed likely for persistence. Additional command and control occurs via TOR exit nodes. The PDF provides multiple detection opportunities focused on monitoring use of msiexec, fodhelper, odbcconf, rundll32, and regsvr32 for suspicious activities indicative of Raspberry Robin. Raspberry Robin has been observed targeting technology and manufacturing sectors but the ultimate objectives are unknown. The PDF aims to share early threat intelligence to improve collective detection of this emerging activity cluster. Key intelligence gaps around initial infection vector and later stage behaviors remain.
