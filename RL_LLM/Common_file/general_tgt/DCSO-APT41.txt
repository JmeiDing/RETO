The document describes an investigation by DCSO CyTec into a campaign conducted by APT41 against a German financial company. The initial intrusion occurred in March 2021 via exploitation of ProxyLogon vulnerabilities in Exchange Server. The actor installed a China Chopper webshell for persistence. After over a year of inactivity, the actor returned in March 2022, having retained access via the webshell. The actor conducted credential dumping with Procdump and lateral movement to a domain controller. The DC was used to stage tools and run discovery scripts to identify targets. The actor leveraged commercial encryption software Jetico BestCrypt to encrypt servers and Microsoft BitLocker to encrypt workstations. Batch scripts were used to automate deployment across systems. Ransom notes were distributed demanding bitcoin. While encryption was attempted across many systems, it was blocked by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Forensics showed the actor's tactics, including living off the land tools, deleting scripts, and RDP access via NATBypass. Overlaps exist with other campaigns attributed to APT41. In summary, APT41 retained access via webshell, conducted discovery, and attempted ransomware deployment which was ultimately unsuccessful due to endpoint detection. The incident highlights the group's ongoing targeting of foreign corporations using ransomware, encryption software, and native tools.
