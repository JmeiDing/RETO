 The PDF is a report by Mandiant detailing the evolution and recent activity of the financially-motivated threat group FIN7. Mandiant has been tracking FIN7 since 2017, and this report provides an update on their operations through 2021. Key points: FIN7 continues to be active, evolving their tactics, techniques, and procedures over time. Mandiant merged 8 previously separate threat clusters into FIN7 in early 2022 based on extensive analysis of overlaps in infrastructure, code, and tactics. FIN7 heavily leverages PowerShell in intrusions, reusing unique commands across campaigns. They developed a PowerShell backdoor called POWERPLANT which is under active development. FIN7 has diversified initial access techniques, now also using supply chain compromise and stolen credentials in addition to phishing. They often use the POWERPLANT backdoor as first stage malware now rather than LOADOUT/GRIFFON. While not directly attributing ransomware deployment to FIN7, there is evidence like shared infrastructure suggesting FIN7 relationships with various ransomware operations like DARKSIDE over time. FIN7 continues to rapidly modify tools like LOADOUT to evade detections, using obfuscation and packaging malware with things like Bible verses. In addition to core FIN7 activity, Mandiant tracks other clusters suspected to be associated like a "BadUSB" campaign distributing DICELOADER and phishing campaigns using BIRDWATCH. Despite 2018 indictments of some members, FIN7 continues to operate, targeting organizations across many industries with intrusions through 2021 and increased speed/scale.
