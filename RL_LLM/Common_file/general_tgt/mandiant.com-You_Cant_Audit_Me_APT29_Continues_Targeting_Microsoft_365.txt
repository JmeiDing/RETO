Here is a summary of the key points from the Mandiant report on APT29's targeting of Microsoft 365: The Russian state-sponsored hacking group APT29 continues to aggressively target organizations involved in shaping NATO countries' foreign policy. They frequently re-compromise victims they've breached previously. APT29 is demonstrating advanced tactics for evading detection and masking their activities in Microsoft 365 environments. They have been observed disabling logging features like Purview Audit on compromised accounts before collecting emails. This prevents logs that would show their mailbox access. The group is taking over dormant Microsoft 365 accounts by resetting passwords and quickly enrolling multi-factor authentication. This bypasses MFA protections. To hide their last-mile attacks, APT29 uses Azure virtual machines outside the victim's subscription. The Microsoft IP addresses are less likely to raise alerts. The group intersperses benign admin actions on accounts/apps among their malicious activity. This masquerades adversarial actions as legitimate administrator behavior. Overall, APT29 continues honing their tradecraft for stealthy Microsoft 365 intrusions. They rapidly adopt new techniques for accessing cloud environments while erasing their tracks.
