Here is a summary of the key information in the PDF: The PDF describes research by Microsoft into a polymorphic malware threat called Dexphot that was detected in October 2018. Dexphot used sophisticated techniques like encryption, obfuscation, randomized file names, and process hollowing to infect devices and evade security solutions. Once installed, Dexphot ran a cryptocurrency miner on infected devices. It also had monitoring services and scheduled tasks to re-infect systems if defenders tried to remove the malware. Over a year of tracking, Microsoft observed Dexphot upgrade its techniques and work around defenses. The PDF provides details on Dexphot's complex attack chain, including use of installers, DLLs, ZIP archives, MSI packages, batch scripts, etc. to ultimately execute malicious code hidden inside legitimate processes like svchost.exe. Dexphot exhibited polymorphism across these attack components to avoid detection. Dexphot also used hundreds of domains with randomized file names to host payloads and regularly update itself. The PDF emphasizes how behavior-based machine learning detection in Microsoft Defender ATP was key to blocking the threat at multiple attack stages. The PDF concludes by highlighting how Dexphot exemplifies the sophistication of everyday threats intent on profiting undetected. Defending against such threats requires next-gen capabilities like those in Microsoft Defender ATP to detect, block, and remediate attacks across the full attack chain.
