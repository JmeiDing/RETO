This report from Symantec Security Response provides an analysis of the Trojan.Taidoor malware family. Taidoor has been used in targeted cyberattacks since 2008. It is delivered via spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments that exploit vulnerabilities to install Taidoor on target systems. Taidoor initially targeted government organizations and private companies, but since 2011 it has focused on think tanks and organizations involved in US-Taiwan policy discussions. The volume of attacks increased significantly in mid 2011, coinciding with discussions around upgrading Taiwan's air force. Taidoor uses compromised servers to communicate with command and control centers. Symantec observed sessions showing attackers interactively exploring compromised systems, searching for valuable data. 14 versions of Taidoor have been identified, showing it is actively maintained. The attackers appear to be an organized group with reasonable hacking capabilities, but lack resources to develop zero-day exploits. They rely on publicly known vulnerabilities and spearphishing for initial access. Their tactics involve persistently targeting high-value individuals and organizations. Symantec detects and protects against Taidoor using signatures, reputation-based blocking, behavior monitoring, and other technologies. Taidoor remains an active threat, but following security best practices provides protection against such targeted attacks.
