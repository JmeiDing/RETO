The PDF describes the discovery of the first known rootkit infecting the firmware of HP iLO (Integrated Lights-Out) server management modules. It provides background on HP iLO technology, which is an independent subsystem integrated on the server motherboard to allow remote management capabilities. The iLO runs its own firmware on an ARM processor with dedicated flash storage. The report then analyzes a malware sample named Implant.ARM.iLOBleed.a found infecting an iLO firmware. The malware adds a malicious module and prevents firmware upgrades to maintain persistence. It simulates upgrade completion to hide its presence. The malware provides backdoor access to wipe server disks repeatedly. The malware disables firmware integrity checks during boot. It adds a module named newELF that wipes disks on a schedule. Three files are created for command and control. The schedule file contains the next wipe date and counter. The counter decrements after each wipe until it reaches zero. The malware also hooks legitimate iLO modules to hide its activities. The report suggests protections like isolating the iLO network, updating to latest firmware, using iLO defense settings to block downgrades, and periodically scanning iLO firmware integrity. In summary, this is the first known malware infecting and persisting in HP iLO server management firmware. It provides covert backdoor access to wipe disks while hiding its presence. The report analyzes the malware and provides suggestions to improve iLO firmware security.
