Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF: The cybersecurity firm Accenture has analyzed a new variant of the Elise malware that is being distributed by the threat group Dragonfish (also known as Lotus Blossom and Spring Dragon). This malware variant appears to be targeting members and associates of the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting (ADMM) in Southeast Asia. The Elise malware is distributed through a malicious Microsoft Word document that exploits the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability to execute and install the malware if the document is opened. Once installed, it harvests extensive system data and exfiltrates it to a hardcoded command and control server. Accenture provides technical details on how the malware functions, including the mutexes, files, registry keys, and other artifacts it creates. The malware launches Internet Explorer to inject its code and uses AES encryption to obfuscate its C2 communications. For mitigation, Accenture recommends blocking access to the identified C2 server and ensuring the Microsoft patch for CVE-2017-11882 is installed. They also provide specific threat hunting recommendations based on the indicators of compromise and behaviors identified in the malware analysis. The report concludes that this campaign is linked to the Dragonfish group's previous efforts to target government, military, and political organizations in Southeast Asia. The new Elise variant demonstrates the group's continued focus on cyber espionage in the region.
