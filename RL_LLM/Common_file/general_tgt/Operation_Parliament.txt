Kaspersky Lab has been tracking a series of cyberespionage attacks targeting high-profile organizations around the world since early 2017. The attacks appear to be geopolitically motivated. The main targets are government entities in the Middle East and North Africa, especially Palestine, including parliaments, senates, top state offices, military agencies, ministries, and more. Other regions have also been hit. The attackers use spearphishing to distribute malware that provides a remote command shell for stealing data. Decoy documents are tailored to the targets. Over 100 victims have been identified across the Palestinian Territories, Egypt, Jordan, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and many other countries including the US, UK, Russia, and more. Attribution is difficult due to the use of false flags, but the targeting points to a sophisticated threat actor with access to an elaborate database of high-value targets worldwide. The malware payload uses encryption and obfuscation to hide its C&C communications. It can execute scripts and commands received from the C&C server. The report advises high-profile targets to implement elevated cybersecurity measures like threat intelligence, endpoint detection and response, and air-gapped networks.
