The PDF provides technical analysis of MoonBounce, a UEFI firmware implant used to persistently compromise systems. MoonBounce hooks legitimate boot services functions like AllocatePool and ExitBootServices to execute malicious shellcode during the boot process. The shellcode injects a kernel driver into Windows, which injects a user-mode malware stager into svchost.exe. The stager reaches out to a command and control server to download further payloads. MoonBounce is stealthy, operating solely in memory and cleaning up traces after execution. It abuses normal system functions instead of using exploits. The firmware implant ensures persistence across reboots. Detailed indicators of compromise are provided, including hashes and timestamps of the rogue UEFI component and other stages of the malware. The analysis shows how MoonBounce leverages deep system internals to compromise endpoints in a stealthy manner that's difficult to detect and remove.
