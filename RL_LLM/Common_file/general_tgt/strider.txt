The report analyzes a cyberespionage group called Strider that has been active since at least 2011 targeting organizations in Russia, China, Sweden, and Belgium. Strider uses a sophisticated malware toolkit called Remsec for stealthy spying and data exfiltration. Remsec has a modular framework with components that include a loader, Lua scripts, a keylogger, network listeners, and backdoors. It uses advanced techniques like executable blobs, encryption, and network-based modules to avoid detection. The keylogger contains a reference to the Lord of the Rings villain Sauron, leading researchers to nickname it after the all-seeing antagonist. Remsec allows Strider to establish persistent access, log keystrokes, steal files, and move laterally on networks. Strider has maintained a low profile and selective targeting, compromising dozens of systems across a handful of victim organizations. The report aims to expose the group's tactics to improve defenses against similar advanced persistent threat actors.
