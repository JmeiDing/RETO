The cyberthreat group MuddyWater has been actively targeting organizations in the Middle East and Asia since at least 2017. Trend Micro researchers uncovered new campaigns in 2019 that show MuddyWater is continuously evolving its tactics and tools. The campaigns distribute new multi-stage PowerShell backdoors like POWERSTATS v3 and use compromised accounts for spear-phishing. Other backdoors deployed include SHARPSTATS, DELPHSTATS, and obfuscated versions of POWERSTATS. Public post-exploitation tools are also utilized. Connections were found between MuddyWater and 4 Android malware families, indicating mobile users may be targets too. False flags are used in some tools to misattribute attacks to certain countries like China, Israel, and Russia. Command and control infrastructure uses direct IP addresses and compromised WordPress sites as proxies. Victims are in government and across various industries. MuddyWater has successfully compromised many targets by continuously modifying its infection vectors, especially via email spear-phishing. Recommended defensive measures include robust email security, employee security awareness training, and advanced threat detection systems.
