The report by Morphisec analyzes a new .NET infostealer malware called Jupyter discovered during an incident response investigation. Jupyter primarily targets Chromium, Firefox, and Chrome browser data, but also has backdoor capabilities. The attack starts with a downloader executable that impersonates legitimate software. It executes a .NET C2 client that can download additional payloads, run commands, and hollow code into system processes. The C2 uses a protocol with versioning and unique victim IDs. The C2 retrieves a PowerShell loader that decodes and runs the Jupyter infostealer payload. Jupyter exfiltrates browser data like cookies and credentials back to a command server. It copies data before accessing it to avoid detection. Jupyter has evolved through multiple versions since May 2020 to add capabilities like Firefox data theft, Windows startup folder persistence, and new communications protocols. Code analysis indicates it originates from a Russian developer. Morphisec concludes that Jupyter's constant evolution demonstrates the limitations of detection-based security tools. The company's moving target defense approach protects against these advanced unknown threats without needing to detect the attack chain. The report provides IOCs, YARA rules, and details on Jupyter's multi-stage attack process to help identify infections. Jupyter exemplifies sophisticated modular info stealers that evade defenses by frequently changing tactics.
