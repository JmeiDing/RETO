The PDF describes the activities of a cyberespionage group named Worok that has been active since at least 2020, primarily targeting organizations in Asia. Worok has developed its own set of custom hacking tools including loaders named CLRLoad and PNGLoad, and a PowerShell backdoor called PowHeartBeat. The tools are obfuscated using techniques like compression, encoding, encryption, and steganography. PowHeartBeat can communicate with command and control servers over HTTP or ICMP to receive commands and exfiltrate data. It has capabilities to run commands, upload/download files, gather system info, etc. PNGLoad searches for PNG image files containing hidden payloads embedded steganographically. It extracts the payloads from the images to decrypt and execute malicious PowerShell scripts. Worok has compromised targets in various sectors like telecom, banking, maritime, energy, and government entities. Their goal appears to be stealing sensitive information from victims. Links to threat actor TA428 are considered low confidence. Worok continues to actively target organizations in 2022. The report provides indicators of compromise and other technical details on the group's activities for defenders to monitor potential targeting.
