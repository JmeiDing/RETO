The document is a case study by Triumfant on how its software would have detected and responded to the Operation Aurora cyberattack against Google in 2010. It provides a detailed analysis of how Triumfant's real-time malware scanning and endpoint anomaly detection capabilities would have detected the attack by identifying suspicious registry keys created during installation of the malware. Once detected, Triumfant's analytics engine would have compared the infected system to an adaptive reference model to identify files, registry keys, processes and other anomalies indicative of the attack. Further correlation analysis would have determined the malware was communicating over the internet. Triumfant's knowledge base allows saving information about new attacks to create recognition filters that can check for infections across the environment and enable automatic remediation responses. For Operation Aurora, an analyst could have created filters to search for other infected systems. For remediation, Triumfant uses the comprehensive details gathered on all changes made during the attack to surgically restore altered files, registry keys, configurations etc. to remove the malware and restore the endpoint to pre-infection state, without needing to reimage. The report concludes Triumfant's capabilities for real-time detection of targeted malware, precision anomaly analysis, adaptive knowledge base, and surgical remediation would have rapidly detected Operation Aurora and restored infected systems to pre-attack condition. It highlights Triumfant's strengths against advanced threats that evade traditional protections.
