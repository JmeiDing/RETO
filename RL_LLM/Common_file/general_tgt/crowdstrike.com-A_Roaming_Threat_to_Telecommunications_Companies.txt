The blog post analyzes the tactics, techniques, and procedures of a sophisticated threat actor group called LightBasin (aka UNC1945) that has been actively targeting the telecommunications sector since 2016. The group has extensive knowledge of telecommunications protocols, including emulation to facilitate C2 and scanning/packet-capture tools for retrieving subscriber information and call metadata. CrowdStrike Services observed reverse shells from this implant communicating with a server owned by another compromised telecom company in a different part of the world, typically connecting to remote system on TCP port 53. LightBasin added iptables rules to the eDNS server to ensure SSH access from five of the compromised telecom companies, and replaced legitimate iptables binary with a Trojanized version that filters out output containing IP addresses belonging to these companies. LightBasin breached companies by compromised GPRS network components like external DNS servers. They used password spraying to gain initial access. Custom malware like the PingPong implant and Slapstick backdoor were deployed to establish persistence and pivot across networks. The group showed intricate knowledge of telecom protocols and systems. They emulated GSM infrastructure with tools like sgsnemu to disguise command and control. Scanning tools retrieved subscriber data from mobile networks. Traffic analysis tools parsed metadata of interest. Attribution is unclear but targeting aligns with signals intelligence. 13 telecom companies across the world have been breached since 2019. Recommendations include restricting unauthorized protocols, monitoring for anomalies, auditing partner network security, and telecom-specific threat intel. In summary, the post highlights the extensive telecommunications expertise and sophisticated tactics of LightBasin to stealthily collect data of intelligence value from providers globally.
