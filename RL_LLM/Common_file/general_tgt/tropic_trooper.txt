The report from Palo Alto Networks details attacks by a threat actor group called Tropic Trooper, which has been active since at least 2011 targeting organizations in Taiwan and other Asia Pacific countries. Tropic Trooper typically uses spearphishing emails containing exploits to deliver malware like Yahoyah. The report confirms they also use Poison Ivy and possibly PCShare malware. In August 2016, Tropic Trooper targeted Taiwan's Executive Yuan government office and a fossil fuel company with spearphishing using weaponized Office documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158. The malware payload was Poison Ivy configured to communicate with command and control servers typically hacked third party systems. The decoy document contained content related to Taiwanese political and activist movements. Infrastructure analysis uncovered ties between Yahoyah, Poison Ivy, and PCShare malware used by Tropic Trooper. The group actively maintains and reuses malware and exploits over time. Tropic Trooper appears to be a persistent, organized threat group focused on targets in Taiwan and the Asia Pacific region. Their tactics rely on social engineering and known exploits rather than zero-days. Protection measures against Tropic Trooper include blocking their infrastructure, preventing Office exploit delivery, behavioral analysis to detect malware execution, and other threat prevention techniques.
