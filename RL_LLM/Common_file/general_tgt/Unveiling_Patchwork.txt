The PDF describes an investigation by security company Cymmetria into a targeted cyberattack campaign they call Patchwork. The campaign has been active since at least December 2015 and has infected around 2,500 machines, targeting government and military personnel working on Southeast Asia and South China Sea issues. Cymmetria caught the malware using a deception technique that tricked the attackers into revealing additional tools and lateral movement activities. The initial infection vector was spear phishing emails with weaponized PowerPoint presentations exploiting the Sandworm vulnerability. If the target system was deemed valuable, a second stage malware tool called 7zip.exe was deployed for persistence and data exfiltration. The malware utilized code copied from various online forums and open source tools. Communication with command and control servers revealed details about the attackers' infrastructure. Time zone analysis of C&C server activity suggests the attackers are likely located in India and are possibly aligned with Indian government interests, though attribution is not definitive. The use of deception to reveal the second stage malware and pivoting activities makes this a novel disclosure. The report highlights the effectiveness of deception in capturing threats missed by other detection methods. It also underscores a trend of threat actors utilizing cheap, low-sophistication tools built from publicly available code, perhaps to avoid losses when operations are eventually disclosed.
