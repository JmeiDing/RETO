The PDF document from Mandiant details the investigation of novel malware being deployed on VMware ESXi hypervisors by a threat actor tracked as UNC3886. The malware ecosystem enables persistent administrative access to the hypervisor, command execution on guest VMs, file transfers between the hypervisor and VMs, tampering with logs, and executing commands between VMs on the same hypervisor. The malware was initially detected when commands were seen coming from the vmtoolsd process on a Windows VM hosted on an ESXi hypervisor. Analysis of the ESXi boot profiles revealed malicious VIBs (vSphere Installation Bundles) being used to deploy backdoors called VIRTUALPITA and VIRTUALPIE on the hypervisors after reboot. The VIBs were signed as PartnerSupported though they were actually CommunitySupported, allowing installation with the --force flag. VIRTUALPITA creates a listener on the hypervisor for arbitrary command execution, file transfers, and starting/stopping logging. VIRTUALPIE is a Python backdoor with similar capabilities. Commands executed on the hypervisor are sent to guest VMs via vmtoolsd.exe for execution. This was used for file enumeration, compression, and credential dumping. VARIUALPITA samples were also found on Linux vCenter systems masquerading as a legitimate process. Windows VMs hosted on the compromised hypervisors contained VIRTUALGATE, a utility that uses VMCI sockets to run commands on guest VMs from the hypervisor. Based on the nature of the intrusions, Mandiant assesses UNC3886 has a likely China nexus and espionage motivations. Indicators of compromise, Yara rules, and recommendations for hardening ESXi/vSphere environments are provided.
