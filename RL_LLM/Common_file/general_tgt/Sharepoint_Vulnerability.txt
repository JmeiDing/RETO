The document describes threat actors exploiting a SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604) to install webshells on SharePoint servers at government organizations in the Middle East. In September 2019, attackers exploited the vulnerability to deploy an Awen webshell on a government organization's SharePoint server. They then installed an AntSword webshell, which is very similar to the notorious China Chopper webshell. Using the webshells, the attackers ran commands to discover details about the compromised system and network. They also uploaded tools like Mimikatz to dump credentials and Impacket tools to move laterally to other systems. In a separate incident in September 2019, the same custom Mimikatz variant was uploaded to a webshell on another government organization's server. This indicates the same threat actor was likely involved in both attacks. The SharePoint vulnerability CVE-2019-0604 has been patched since March 2019, but the attacks show actors are still actively exploiting it. Shodan scans found nearly 29,000 Internet-facing servers advertising vulnerable SharePoint versions. The modular webshells allow attackers to remotely control compromised servers. The AntSword webshell requires creating a custom encoder in its client tool to interact with it. The tools and techniques observed are similar to previous activity by a group tracked as Emissary Panda. However, concrete connections between these attacks are lacking. Targeting vulnerable SharePoint servers provides threat actors an initial foothold in networks, from which credentials can be dumped and further access gained. Rapidly patching known vulnerabilities is critical to deny this entry point.
