The cybercriminal group Lazarus has been conducting cyberattacks against Albanian government entities in two waves, using ransomware and data-wiping malware signed with stolen certificates. The first wave occurred in July 2022, impacting Albanian e-services. The second wave started in September, targeting critical law enforcement systems with similar malware but modified for detection evasion. Wave 2 ransomware samples share similarities with wave 1, including the use of CreateFile and WriteFile APIs for file overwrites and RC4 encryption algorithm. The ransomware in both waves is based on ROADSWEEP, uses stolen certificates to appear legitimate, and encrypts files in an unrecoverable way, rendering a ransom demand ineffective. The wiper malware embeds a raw disk driver for direct access to wipe data quickly. In the second wave, the attackers used a leaked Nvidia code signing certificate to sign the wiper and embedded the disk driver within the malware for automated execution post-installation. They also modified messaging and encryption keys to evade security controls. Underground posts suggest the attackers may have used AnyDesk for initial access. Different attack groups speaking Persian and another language appear to be cooperating in the campaign. The malware contains political messaging reflecting tensions between Albania and Iran. The targeting of law enforcement and modifications for speed align with prior devastating Shamoon wiper attacks in the Middle East. Defenders are advised to monitor for suspicious certificates and remote access software to detect potential intrusions. The publication provides indicators of compromise and detection details for the malware.
