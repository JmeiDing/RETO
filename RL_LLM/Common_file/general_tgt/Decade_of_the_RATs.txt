The PDF discusses the activities of five Chinese state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) groups - WINNTI, PASSCV, BRONZE UNION, CASPER, and WLNXSPLINTER - that have been actively targeting organizations through cyber espionage operations for nearly a decade. These groups strategically target enterprise Linux servers which are critical backend components of most large networks but often overlooked in security strategies. The groups use a Linux malware toolset, including backdoors and rootkits, that has gone undetected for years, allowing long-term access. The report links the massive 2014 XOR.DDoS botnet to the WINNTI group based on code similarities. It also reveals the groups shift from stealing certificates from gaming companies to adware developers to bypass defenses by hiding in plain sight among adware alerts. It examines newly discovered Android implants used alongside Windows malware for cross-platform surveillance. One resembles a commercial remote access tool released nearly 2 years later, raising questions about its origins. The groups blend financially motivated attacks with espionage and share tools and infrastructure, suggesting coordination or personnel overlap. They are likely civilian contractors directed by regional intelligence officers, providing the Chinese government deniability. Their longevity and adaptability allow continued success despite public exposure of some members. The report aims to raise awareness of their tactics targeting overlooked platforms like Linux and mobile to enable more effective security against them.
