The document describes new activity from a cyberespionage group called ChessMaster that is targeting organizations in Japan. ChessMaster is continuously evolving its tools and tactics. Attackers exploit the CVE-2017-8759 SOAP WSDL parser vulnerability to compromise targeted systems. The latest campaign starts with a phishing email containing an exploit document abusing a .NET Framework vulnerability. When opened, it executes a multi-stage infection chain: 1. The document reaches out to a remote server to download and execute the first backdoor. 2. The first backdoor is a JScript RAT that gathers system info and launches a Powershell script. 3. The Powershell script downloads and activates the second backdoor from another remote server. 4. The second backdoor is a DLL that injects into svchost.exe and contains basic backdoor capabilities. 5. It connects to a command and control server to exfiltrate system information and can receive additional modules. While the second backdoor has similarities to previous ChessMaster tools like ChChes, it appears to be a new malware family dubbed BKDR_ANEL. ChessMaster regularly evolves its tools and infection tactics to avoid detection. The report provides IOCs associated with the campaign like hashes, C2 servers, and URLs. It advises using updated patches, behavior monitoring, email security, and comprehensive endpoint protection to detect and block this attack.
