The report describes the activities of the financially-motivated hacking group Cobalt, which has been active since 2016 targeting banks, financial organizations, and companies worldwide. Cobalt relies on spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments to infiltrate target networks. In 2017, Cobalt evolved its tactics, leveraging compromised partner company infrastructure to send more convincing phishing emails to banks. The group registered lookalike domains posing as financial regulators to distribute malware. Cobalt customized its attacks for different regions, sending North American phishing emails during European business hours. Cobalt uses commercial exploit builders and obfuscation tools to create malicious Office documents that download malware droppers when opened. The group rapidly incorporated a new Microsoft Word vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) into its attacks. Cobalt's malware gives remote access via the Beacon Trojan, allowing collection of sensitive data. The report provides examples of Cobalt's phishing emails, attack stages, malware analysis, working hours, and infrastructure. It warns that Cobalt likely causes multimillion-dollar losses at victim banks. As Cobalt evolves its techniques, continued monitoring and collaboration between security researchers, regulators, and targets is crucial to disrupt this persistent threat.
