The cybersecurity firm Truesec investigated an attack that showed collaboration between the FIN7 and RYUK hacking groups, part of Russian cybercrime networks. In the first stage, FIN7 conducted a phishing attack to gain access to a victim enterprise network using their tools like a JavaScript backdoor and CARBANAK malware. In the second stage weeks later, the RYUK ransomware group took over the compromised network, deploying Cobalt Strike and exfiltrating data. Finally, the RYUK group deployed ransomware across the network for financial gain. This collaboration between FIN7 providing initial access and RYUK deploying ransomware is a change from FIN7's previous financial theft targets. The staged attack with different tools indicates separate FIN7 and RYUK teams were involved. Truesec believes this shows the two groups are closely affiliated as part of the same cybercrime network, with FIN7 providing access for RYUK's ransomware attacks. This collaboration and shift of FIN7 to enabling ransomware presents a growing threat for enterprises. It demonstrates the evolution of tactics between cybercriminal groups and networks. Companies should be vigilant about phishing and network security to prevent the initial footholds that lead to ransomware deployment.
