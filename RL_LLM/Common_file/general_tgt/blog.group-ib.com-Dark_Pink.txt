The cybersecurity company Group-IB has discovered a new advanced persistent threat (APT) group called Dark Pink that has been actively attacking organizations in Asia-Pacific and Europe since mid-2021. Dark Pink has successfully breached at least 7 high-profile targets including military agencies, government bodies, and a religious organization. The group uses custom malware tools like TelePowerBot, KamiKakaBot, and information stealers Cucky and Ctealer to infiltrate networks and exfiltrate sensitive documents. The sophistication of Dark Pink's campaign is demonstrated by its multiple distinct kill chains and use of PowerShell scripts or commands. The main initial infection vector is spear-phishing emails posing as job applicants and containing ISO images with malware. Once executed, the malware ensures persistence on the system and collects information about the network. Lateral movement is achieved by infecting USB devices plugged into compromised machines. Exfiltration happens via Telegram API bots. The group uses evasion techniques like DLL side-loading to avoid detection. While the origin of Dark Pink is still unknown, their advanced custom tools, evolving tactics, and successful breaches of high-value targets demonstrate the serious threat they pose. Group-IB researchers are continuing efforts to uncover more details about this APT group and have notified confirmed and potential victims. The report aims to raise awareness about the TTPs used by Dark Pink to help organizations strengthen their security posture against such threats.
