The PDF describes a persistent cyberespionage campaign called Operation Lotus Blossom that has been targeting government and military organizations in Southeast Asia since 2012. The attackers use spear phishing emails with malicious Office document attachments that exploit vulnerabilities to install a custom remote access trojan (RAT) malware called Elise. Elise has been primarily used to target Vietnam, Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Indonesia. The decoy documents in the spear phishing emails contain content relevant to the target's interests, like military personnel rosters and training documents. Technical analysis is provided on three variants of the Elise malware. It has features for remote command execution, file operations, data exfiltration, and receiving updated configurations from command and control servers. The report attributes the campaign to a well-resourced, persistent threat actor, likely a nation-state with strong interests in the Southeast Asia region. While the specific actors are unknown, the tools, tactics, and targets are consistent with a government-supported cyberespionage operation. The malware infrastructure largely overlaps between the attacks on each country, indicating coordination as part of the Operation Lotus Blossom campaign. The report concludes that small, under-the-radar campaigns like this can still cause major damage over time to their targets.
