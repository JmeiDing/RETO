Deep Instinct's Threat Research team discovered a new malware variant written in Golang which they named Arid Gopher. Further analysis showed it is a variant of the Micropsia malware exclusively used by the APT group Arid Viper (also known as APT-C-23). Arid Viper has been active since at least 2017 targeting the Middle East, especially Palestinian targets. They continuously evolve their Windows, Android, and iOS malware. Micropsia is their Windows malware, which Arid Gopher is a new variant of. Arid Gopher uses public Golang libraries from GitHub for legitimate functionality but abuses them maliciously. V1 samples masqueraded as Word documents and displayed decoy Office documents. V2 samples either showed a PDF or Word document decoy. Arid Gopher collects system info like OS version, AV products, takes screenshots, and communicates with a command and control server to receive commands. It achieves persistence by adding a run key or shortcut in the Startup folder. If 360 Total Security is detected, Arid Gopher downloads a Golang "helper" executable called Arid Helper which sets up an alternative persistence mechanism. The researchers also found Arid Gopher downloading additional payloads from its C2 server written in C++. Arid Gopher shows how Arid Viper continuously develops new malware variants and payloads for their campaigns targeting the Middle East region. The decoys and naming schemes match their known patterns. Deep Instinct detects these new variants based on deep learning models instead of only manual rules and signatures. Unknown and targeted threats like Micropsia require predictive deep learning capabilities to detect effectively.
