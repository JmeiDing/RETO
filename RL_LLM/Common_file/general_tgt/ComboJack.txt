The PDF describes a new malware called ComboJack that is designed to steal cryptocurrencies and funds from online wallets. - ComboJack was distributed through a malspam campaign that pretended to contain a lost passport. The malspam message contained a PDF with an embedded RTF file that exploited a Microsoft Office vulnerability to download and install the malware. - ComboJack functions by constantly monitoring the user's clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet addresses. When it detects a wallet address, it replaces it with one controlled by the attacker. This tricks victims into accidentally sending funds to the attacker's wallet instead of the intended recipient. - Unlike previous clipboard hijacking malware like CryptoShuffler that only targeted cryptocurrencies, ComboJack targets both cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero) as well as digital currencies (WebMoney, Yandex Money, Qiwi). - ComboJack uses various techniques to persist on the victim's system and evade detection, including setting itself as a hidden, system level process at startup. - The malware authors appear to be diversifying into stealing different digital currencies in hopes that some will gain more value than others. As cryptocurrency prices rise, targeting them could prove lucrative for attackers. - Palo Alto Networks identifies and blocks ComboJack through its WildFire and Traps products. Customers can track the malware through the AutoFocus threat intelligence platform.
