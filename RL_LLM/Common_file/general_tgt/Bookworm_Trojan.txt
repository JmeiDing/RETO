The document analyzes a modular Windows trojan called Bookworm that has been used in targeted attacks against organizations in Thailand. Bookworm gains initial access by exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities in Telerik UI web applications or by abusing sideloading of signed Microsoft and Kaspersky executables to load malicious DLLs. Once installed, Bookworm has built-in keylogging functionality clipboard capturing capabilitie but its modular architecture allows it to load additional plugins from its command and control server to expand capabilities. The main Bookworm module communicates with the C2 and leverages APIs exposed by supporting modules that provide encryption, network communications, and other functions. Bookworm uses multiple encryption algorithms to encode C2 traffic and files written to disk. It can also receive additional modules from the C2 server and dynamically load them into memory for execution. The report analyzes Bookworm's intricate architecture and provides indicators of compromise like registry keys, files, and network artifacts to detect infections. In summary, Bookworm is a sophisticated, flexible trojan that establishes persistence and has potential to expand its capabilities depending on modules delivered by its C2 server. The report provides an in-depth look at its inner workings and detection opportunities.
