The document describes an attack called 'Operation Oil Tanker' carried out by hackers targeting maritime oil transportation companies. The attack was dubbed 'The Phantom Menace' because it used legitimate tools and scripts rather than malware to steal credentials. It started when a secretary at a company called Black Gold opened a PDF attachment in an email, triggering a chain of events that ultimately led to credentials being stolen and sent to an FTP server. The attack went undetected for 6 months until it was blocked by a new monitoring system. Analysis showed that it used various scripts and batch files to collect credentials, disable firewalls, rename and upload the stolen data to an FTP server. Over 80,000 stolen credentials were found on the server from around 10 companies in the oil transportation sector, indicating it was a targeted attack. Research into the FTP account led to suspicions the attack originated from Nigeria, likely to steal documents used in Nigerian oil scams. The email address linked to the FTP account pointed to an individual in Lagos, but lack of victims willing to report the attack meant police could not investigate further. The article concludes that traditional security is not enough to stop attacks like this, and companies need to implement additional protections and audits to control and monitor their networks more effectively. However, companies prefer to keep attacks secret rather than report them, enabling hackers to continue unchecked.
