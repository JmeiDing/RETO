The report analyzes a new malware campaign dubbed "KillSomeOne" used in targeted attacks against organizations in Myanmar. The attacks use a technique called DLL side-loading to execute malicious code by hijacking legitimate Windows components. Four scenarios were identified where weaponized documents deliver a malicious DLL that side-loads a payload. The payloads include remote access tools with basic reverse shell capabilities. The malware uses multiple layers of encryption with politically-themed keys like "Hapenexx is very bad" and installs itself persistently using tasks and registry modifications. Analysis of the threat actor's tools suggests Chinese origins based on strings, targeting, and other clues. However, the malware quality is mixed - some sophisticated deployment tactics but unsophisticated coding practices. The report concludes the group's capabilities and future direction remain uncertain but continued monitoring is warranted. Overall, the report provides technical details on the side-loading techniques, encryption, and installer behaviors of the KillSomeOne campaign. It highlights an emergent threat actor leveraging a known but still stealthy attack technique for targeted intrusions.
