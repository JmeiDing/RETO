The document discusses an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group called WINDSHIFT that has been actively operating since at least 2017. WINDSHIFT is focused on cyber espionage and intelligence gathering, targeting specific individuals rather than organizations. Their tactics include long-term reconnaissance of targets via fake social media personas, sending benign emails over months to build trust, and eventually credential phishing or targeted malware attacks. WINDSHIFT uses custom macOS and Windows malware including WINDTAIL, WINDTAPE, and WINDROP. These tools are designed for surveillance, screenshot capturing, and exfiltrating sensitive files. The malware code shows similarities to other APT groups like SOFACY, indicating WINDSHIFT may be reusing or repurposing code. WINDSHIFT infrastructure also overlaps with other APTs, suggesting they may be hacking other groups to acquire tools and access. Attribution is unclear but there are similarities to an Indian APT called BAHAMUT. Links are also made to a discontinued security firm called Appin Security, as WINDSHIFT malware contains code from Appin tools leaked in 2013. Overall, WINDSHIFT demonstrates sophisticated, covert tactics for long-term monitoring of targets. Their ability to remain undetected shows OPSEC priorities and separation between reconnaissance and malware infrastructure. While attribution is uncertain, the group continues actively targeting high-value individuals in the Middle East region.
