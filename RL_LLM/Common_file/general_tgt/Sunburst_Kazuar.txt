The document analyzes similarities between the Sunburst malware used in the SolarWinds supply chain attack and an older backdoor called Kazuar first reported in 2017. Overlapping code features suggest a potential link between Sunburst and Kazuar. Key similarities include the use of a modified FNV-1a hashing algorithm, a long delays between C2 communications, and a victim ID generation algorithm using MD5 and XOR. While not identical, the shared algorithms indicate similar thought processes in developing the malware. Kazuar has been continuously updated since 2015 and associated with cyberespionage campaigns out of Russia. The latest 2020 Kazuar versions contain code even more similar to Sunburst. The nature of the connection between the two malware families remains unclear - they could originate from the same group, reuse code, have a common source, or it could be an intentional false flag. More research is needed to uncover the relationship between Sunburst and Kazuar. The code overlaps don't definitively tie SolarWinds to Kazuar or the Turla APT group, but provide an initial link for further investigation. The key is encouraging more researchers to analyze the similarity and connections between the two sophisticated malware families.
