The report details the activities of the Naikon advanced persistent threat (APT) group, which has been active for over 5 years conducting cyberespionage campaigns focused on countries around the South China Sea region. Naikon relies on spearphishing emails with weaponized attachments that install remote access tools when opened by the victim. The main tool is a feature-rich backdoor that can exfiltrate files, execute commands, install plugins etc. Command and control infrastructure exhibits per-country operator assignments and occasional use of in-country proxy servers to avoid detection. The report analyzes one campaign targeting a specific country referred to as X. Affected organizations include the Office of the President, military, intelligence services, police, aviation authority, and more. The attacker, known as operator X, used keyloggers and network sniffers to steal credentials and data. Operator X also exploited the use of personal email accounts for work communications in the country to register similar addresses for spearphishing. Naikon has clashed with other groups like Hellsing that are also active in the regions it operates in. The scale of Naikon's operations, focused targeting, and technical capabilities make it a formidable threat actor that continues to pursue geostrategic intelligence across Asia. Recommended defenses include blocking malicious attachments, monitoring outbound connections, and threat intelligence sharing.
