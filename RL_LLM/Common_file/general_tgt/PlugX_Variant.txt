The report details the analysis conducted by the Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg (CIRCL) on a variant of the PlugX remote access trojan (RAT) malware, specifically version 7.0. The analysis used a combination of dynamic and static techniques to overcome obfuscation and encryption. The malware sample drops and executes a series of files to eventually load and inject malicious code into the memory of signed Microsoft binaries svchost.exe and msiexec.exe. This allows the malware to communicate with the command and control server while only running trusted processes. It also defeats security mechanisms like Windows User Account Control. The malware functionality includes commands for system access and control, file and registry manipulation, network and domain enumeration, SQL queries, keylogging, and others. It uses encrypted TCP communications with hard-coded domain help.yahoo-upgrade.com for command and control. Persistence mechanisms involve copied files and registry modifications to automatically run the malware at system start. The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, registry keys, domains, and network addresses associated with the malware. It also notes the modular, extensible structure and evidence the authors prioritized stability and quality in developing PlugX.
