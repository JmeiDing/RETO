The document describes a cyberattack campaign called Operation Clandestine Wolf conducted by the threat group APT3. It involved a phishing campaign targeting organizations in aerospace, defense, engineering, technology, telecom, and transportation sectors. The phishing emails contained links to compromised servers that profiled targets and served malicious Flash files exploiting an unpatched vulnerability. This resulted in delivery of a custom APT3 backdoor called SHOTPUT. The technical details of the exploit are provided - it used heap spray, vector corruption, and return-oriented programming (ROP) techniques to bypass ASLR and DEP protections. The ROP chain called VirtualAlloc to mark shellcode as executable. The shellcode decrypted and executed the payload which was hidden inside an image file. The payload conducted further profiling, credential theft, lateral movement, and backdoor installation activities. The report concludes that APT3 works quickly to maintain persistent access using zero-days, custom backdoors, and disposable infrastructure across campaigns. It credits security researchers from FireEye for the analysis. In summary, the document analyzes the tactics, techniques, exploits, malware, and infrastructure used in the Operation Clandestine Wolf campaign attributed to the APT3 cyberespionage group.
