The report from Fortinet describes a spearphishing attack targeting a Jordanian diplomat that exhibits the hallmarks of an advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign. The attack begins with an email purportedly from an IT staff member containing a malicious Excel attachment. Analysis of the macro inside the Excel file shows sophisticated techniques like toggling sheet visibility, tracking attack status via WMI pingbacks, and requiring a mouse to be present. The macro drops three files - a signed Microsoft binary, a configuration file, and the main malware payload called update.exe. The update.exe malware uses .NET and keeps track of its own state to introduce long delays, avoiding continuous activity. It uses DNS tunneling and a domain generation algorithm to communicate with three command and control servers registered under fake travel company names. The malware can receive tasks and files via DNS and run hard-coded PowerShell commands for discovery and exfiltration. Encrypted output is sent back to the C2 via more DNS requests. No persistence is created directly - only via the Excel macro's scheduled task. Many details, like the DNS tunneling, PowerShell commands focused on the target's network, and domains masquerading as real companies, suggest the known APT group APT34 (aka OilRig) is behind this attack. The malware exhibits techniques more advanced than typical cybercrime operations. Fortinet has implemented detections for this threat across its products, including FortiGuard Antivirus, IPS, Web Filtering, Email Filtering, Endpoint Detection and Response, and Content Disarm and Reconstruction. IOCs and MITRE ATT&CK mappings are provided to help defend against this attack.
