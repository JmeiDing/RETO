The PDF describes an ongoing malware campaign called Operation Earth Kitsune conducted by a threat actor using the SLUB malware. SLUB was previously documented by Trend Micro targeting websites related to North Korea. The new campaign uses watering hole tactics, compromising websites associated with North Korea. It utilizes multiple exploits like CVE-2019-5782 and CVE-2020-0674 to infect victims. Three malware variants were discovered - an updated SLUB now using Mattermost for C2, and two unknown ones named dneSpy and agfSpy. SLUB exfiltrates system info and screenshots. The campaign checks for security software and skips infection if found, indicating a focus on stealth. SLUB's Mattermost C2 infrastructure was analyzed, revealing usernames, accounts, posts and screenshots. In total, the operation uses 5 C2 servers, 7 samples, and 4 exploits. The sophistication of the malware and multi-vector nature suggests an advanced threat actor. Trend Micro disclosed the vulnerabilities to Mattermost who released a patch.
