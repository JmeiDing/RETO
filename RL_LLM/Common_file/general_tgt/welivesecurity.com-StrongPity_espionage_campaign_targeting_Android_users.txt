The PDF describes a campaign by the threat actor group StrongPity targeting Android users. The campaign distributes a trojanized version of the Telegram app masquerading as the Shagle video chat app from a fake website. The trojanized Telegram app contains StrongPity's Android backdoor code added to Telegram's open source code. The app is signed with a certificate linked to previous StrongPity campaigns. The backdoor is modular, downloading encrypted modules from a C&C server to enable various spying capabilities. The modules allow the backdoor to record calls, collect SMS messages, call logs, contacts, files, app lists, notifications from 17 apps if granted accessibility permissions, etc. Collected data is encrypted and exfiltrated to the C&C server. The campaign has been active since November 2021 but appears narrowly targeted. The app from the fake website was inactive during analysis due to issues obtaining a legit Telegram API ID, but this could change if updated by the attackers. The report provides technical details on the website, app components, permissions required, malicious code similarities, data collection modules, encryption, exfiltration methods, and sandbox evasion techniques. It shows StrongPity's ability to leverage Telegram's code and impersonate real services for targeted surveillance.
