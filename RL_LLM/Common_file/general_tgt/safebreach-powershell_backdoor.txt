The report describes research by SafeBreach Labs on a new fully undetectable (FUD) PowerShell backdoor used to target around 100 victims. The attack starts with a malicious Word document containing a macro that executes PowerShell scripts pretending to be a Windows update. The scripts communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server, receiving encrypted commands to execute on the victim's system. By analyzing the predictable victim IDs used, SafeBreach was able to collect and decrypt the C2 commands for each victim. These included commands for reconnaissance like process and user enumeration, as well as a full PowerShell script for Active Directory and RDP enumeration likely to be used later for lateral movement. The malware author made an operational security mistake allowing their encryption key to be discovered. SafeBreach has incorporated detection of this backdoor into their platform. They aim to raise awareness about this new evasive malware that bypassed antivirus scanners and provide indicators of compromise for detection and protection. Overall, the report highlights the ongoing evolution of sophisticated, stealthy targeted threats, the importance of threat research to uncover novel attacks like this PowerShell backdoor, and the value of sharing detailed findings with the security community.
