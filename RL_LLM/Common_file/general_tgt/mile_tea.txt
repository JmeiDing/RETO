Researchers have analyzed a spying malware campaign named MILE TEA that has targeted organizations in Asia Pacific since 2011, primarily using the Elirks, Micrass, and Logedrut malware families. The attacks start with phishing emails containing malicious attachments masquerading as flight e-tickets. The attachments are installers that drop malware. The initial malware gathers system info and downloads additional malware from C2 servers. The malware uses encrypted C2 communications and retrieves C2 addresses from public blogs. The attackers compromised multiple Japanese trading companies, a Japan petroleum company, a mobile phone company, a Japanese public organization's Beijing office, and a Taiwan government agency. Since 2015, the attackers have reused stolen documents that appear to be from previously compromised organizations as decoys in attacks on new targets. Infrastructure analysis shows a preference for Hong Kong-based C2 servers. The group leaks tools and has poor opsec but continually updates obfuscation. The tools and techniques indicate an advanced, well-resourced attacker focused long-term on espionage against Asia Pacific commercial and government entities.
