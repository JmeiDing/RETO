ESET researchers discovered a new malware campaign targeting Mac users that is attributed to the Lazarus threat group. On August 16, 2022, ESET announced on Twitter that a signed Mac executable disguised as a Coinbase job description was uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil. This is similar to a campaign ESET uncovered in May 2022 originating from Singapore. The malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures. It drops three files: a PDF job description decoy, a bundle called FinderFontsUpdater.app, and a downloader called safarifontagent. The bundle is signed with a certificate issued in February 2022 that Apple revoked on August 12, 2022. Unlike the May campaign, this version connects to a different command and control server at concrecapital[.]com. The server did not respond when analyzed. On August 4, 2022, another security researcher found a Windows version dropping the same PDF and connecting to a different C2. ESET believes this new activity is part of Lazarus' Operation In(ter)ception campaign targeting Mac users. The malware bypasses security products by disguising itself as a legitimate job application. The use of code signing and targeting of cryptocurrency companies indicates the likely purpose is cyberespionage and financial theft. ESET provided hashes for the dropped files and C2 domain to help identify infections. They assess this demonstrates Lazarus' continued efforts to breach MacOS devices through social engineering and Trojanized applications.
