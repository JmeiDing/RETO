The report details the discovery of a sophisticated UEFI firmware rootkit named CosmicStrand that was developed by an unknown Chinese-speaking threat actor. The rootkit infects the firmware of Gigabyte or ASUS motherboards using the H81 chipset, modifying the CSMCORE DXE driver. It executes a chain of hooks during system startup to deploy a kernel implant that retrieves a payload from a command and control server. The rootkit aims to achieve stealthy and persistent infection, surviving OS reinstalls and hard drive replacements. It propagates malicious code execution from UEFI to boot manager to OS loader to Windows kernel. In the kernel, it disables PatchGuard and sets up a thread notify routine to run a callback that retrieves the final payload. The payload sends crafted UDP/TCP packets to the C2 server update.bokts[.]com to obtain a shellcode to run. An older 2016-2017 variant used the domain erda158[.]to instead. Code similarities suggest links to Chinese-speaking actors behind the MyKings botnet and other rootkits. Although active for years, the rootkit infections seem to be focused on private individual victims rather than organizations. The report concludes that UEFI attacks present a blind spot in cybersecurity that needs addressing, and this discovery indicates sophisticated threat actors were using such techniques long before public awareness.
