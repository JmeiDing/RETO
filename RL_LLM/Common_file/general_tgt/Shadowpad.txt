ShadowPad is a privately sold, modular malware platform that emerged around 2015 as a potential successor to the publicly available PlugX malware. It is used by at least four clusters of Chinese state-sponsored espionage activity, including APT41, Tick/Tonto Team, Operation Redbonus, and Operation Redkanku. ShadowPad allows users to remotely upload plugins to infected machines to add new functionality dynamically. It was likely developed by experienced malware authors who previously sold tools and offered services like software cracking and penetration testing. The ShadowPad controller interface allows users to build new malware samples, control command and control communications, and manage infected hosts. Plugins appear to be sold separately rather than bundled together. Several supply chain attacks deployed ShadowPad as the primary backdoor, including attacks on NetSarang, ASUS, and CCleaner. Other users include Tick/Tonto Team, who called it "Casper" internally and used it for phishing and exploit delivery. The adoption of commercial malware like ShadowPad reduces costs for threat actors compared to developing custom tools. Some groups seem to have stopped using their own backdoors after gaining access to ShadowPad. This makes attribution more difficult when a shared tool is involved. In summary, ShadowPad is a privately developed, modular, and actively maintained malware platform sold to multiple Chinese threat groups. Its adoption changes the cost structure for these actors and makes their activities harder to distinguish based on technical details alone.
