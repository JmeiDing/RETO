The document describes research by VMware's Threat Analysis Unit on the command and control (C2) protocol used by the ShadowPad malware. ShadowPad is a modular malware platform used by China-linked threat actors since 2015. ShadowPad supports six C2 protocols: TCP, SSL, HTTP, HTTPS, UDP, and DNS. The analysis focuses on the TCP, HTTP(S), and UDP C2 protocols. It provides details on the packet header formats, encoding algorithms, and initial handshake flows for these protocols. Multiple ShadowPad variants were analyzed that use different encoding values. Based on the protocol analysis, VMware implemented scanners to actively search for ShadowPad C2 servers on the internet. Between 2021-2022, they identified 83 servers linked to 3 variants. The number of active C2s declined in 2022. Samples communicating with discovered C2 IPs included malware like Spyder and ReverseWindow used by China-linked groups. One Spyder sample was found to have code similarities to Winnti malware, suggesting it could be a lightweight version. In summary, the report documents VMware's in-depth analysis of ShadowPad's C2 protocols, implementation of detection scanners, discoveries of 83 C2 servers over time, and connections to advanced malware samples. This showcases the value of C2 protocol analysis and active scanning for proactive discovery of threats.
