A group previously associated with the ShadowPad remote access Trojan (RAT) has adopted a new diverse toolset for an ongoing cyberespionage campaign. The targets are government and state-owned organizations in multiple Asian countries, indicating intelligence gathering goals. The attackers leverage legitimate software like old security tools, browsers etc. to load malware via DLL side-loading, avoiding detection. Once loaded, malicious DLLs execute shellcode from encrypted .dat files to deploy payloads and commands in memory. Credentials are stolen using Mimikatz and ProcDump. Network scanning tools are used to expand access. Various RATs like PlugX, QuasarRAT, Trochilus are deployed on compromised hosts for persistent access. Living off the land tools are used for lateral movement, host enumeration, and data exfiltration. A detailed case study tracks the attackers' activities for months within an Asian government organization. Tactics include credential dumping, lateral movement, DNS enumeration, mounting AD snapshots, user creation etc. The modular malware, use of legitimate tools, and stealthy techniques reflect an advanced threat actor focused on espionage. There are potential links to past ShadowPad activity and APT groups like Blackfly and Mustang Panda. The campaign has targeted multiple government entities since 2021 and continues to be active. Organizations are advised to boost security. In summary, this provides analysis of an ongoing cyberespionage operation targeting Asian governments using sophisticated TTPs, tools, and evasion methods. The threat actors are persistent and likely state-sponsored.
