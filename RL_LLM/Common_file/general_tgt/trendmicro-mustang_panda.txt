The PDF describes the cyberespionage activities of an advanced persistent threat (APT) group called Earth Preta, also known as Mustang Panda or Bronze President. Starting in March 2022, the group conducted large-scale spear-phishing campaigns targeting government, academic, foundations, and research sectors worldwide, including Myanmar, Australia, Philippines, Japan, and Taiwan. The group uses fake Google accounts to distribute malware via emails containing links to archives on Google Drive. The archives contain the TONEINS, TONESHELL, and PUBLOAD malware families which infect systems through techniques like DLL sideloading. PUBLOAD is a downloader, while TONEINS is an installer for the TONESHELL backdoor. TONESHELL is the main remote access malware, supporting functions like file exfiltration, command execution, and lateral movement. It uses raw TCP or HTTP for command and control, encrypting traffic with RC4 or XOR encoding. TONESHELL has multiple variants with evolving capabilities. The group uses various techniques to evade detection, like code obfuscation, custom exception handling, sandbox checks, and API calls with callback functions. Lure documents are crafted to target specific organizations, indicating potential prior access or reconnaissance. Attribution to Earth Preta is based on TTP similarities with past campaigns, reuse of infrastructure, and code overlaps. The group constantly updates its tools and appears to be targeting Asia, compromising partners of Myanmar government to expand access. Defense involves phishing awareness training, sender/subject checking of emails, and a multi-layered security solution to block threats early in the infection chain.
