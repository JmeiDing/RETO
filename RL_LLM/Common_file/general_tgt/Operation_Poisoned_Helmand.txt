The report details a targeted watering hole attack that compromised the content delivery network (CDN) used by the Government of Afghanistan. The attackers modified a JavaScript file hosted on the CDN that is loaded by many Afghan government websites. The malicious script redirects visitors to download a Java applet malware. The applet has ties to previous attacks attributed to Chinese threat actors, known as Operation Poisoned Hurricane. It drops a payload that communicates with a command and control server. The attack occurred on the same day Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang met with Afghan leadership, suggesting the attack was timed to target individuals interested in the meeting. The report speculates the attack aims to target partners involved in troop drawdowns from Afghanistan. The report highlights how compromising a CDN provides a way to distribute malware to many sites from one access point. It can impact public or private sector organizations that use CDNs. Browser content security policies can restrict untrusted third-party content as a defense. The report concludes that as China increases involvement in Afghanistan, its intelligence services are likely using cyber attacks like this watering hole campaign to target military and government victims interested in the region. Sharing threat intelligence is key to defend against such sophisticated attacks.
