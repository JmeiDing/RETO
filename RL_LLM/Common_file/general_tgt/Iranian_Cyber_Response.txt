The PDF discusses the potential Iranian cyber response to the January 2020 U.S. airstrike that killed Qassem Soleimani, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force (IRGC-QF). It provides an analysis of Iran's likely tactics, tools, and hacking groups that could be involved in retaliation. Main points: Iran will likely pursue a measured, asymmetric response to avoid further escalation, but proxies may retaliate more aggressively. Iran has capable cyber forces and the most likely targets are U.S. and partner interests in the Middle East. Attacks may escalate against softer targets by hacktivists. Recent Russian hijacking of Iranian cyber infrastructure adds uncertainty about attribution of operations from Iranian infrastructure. Iran has used destructive malware (Shamoon, ZeroCleare) in prior escalations. Actors like APT33, APT34, APT39 may rely on previous accesses, spearphishing, password spraying. Iran's response will likely rely more heavily on cyber over kinetic means. Espionage and sabotage operations may be carried out by intelligence/military groups or proxies. Misattribution and escalation risks exist due to Russian hijacking of Iranian cyber infrastructure. Monitoring, multi-factor authentication, training can help mitigate risks.
