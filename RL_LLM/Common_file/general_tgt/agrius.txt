The document analyzes a new threat actor named Agrius that has been operating against targets in Israel since 2020. Agrius initially conducted espionage but shifted to destructive attacks using wipers disguised as ransomware, likely for deniability. Researchers assess with moderate confidence that Agrius is an Iranian state-sponsored group based on TTP and tool overlaps, infrastructure, and targeting aligning with Iranian interests. Agrius utilized public penetration testing tools and VPNs for anonymity in the initial access phase. They deployed webshells for persistence and leveraged stolen credentials for lateral movement. Custom malware included the IPsec Helper .NET backdoor for remote access and the Apostle wiper that was evolved into ransomware variants like DEADWOOD. Overlaps suggest in-house development. The targeting of Israeli entities and evolution from espionage to disruptive attacks fits Iran's shifting geopolitical motivations. The ransomware deception provides deniability about the true intent being destruction. Agrius exemplifies a wider trend of state-sponsored groups, like Russia and North Korea, utilizing destructive malware disguised as ransomware to damage and disrupt adversaries while maintaining a level of deniability.
