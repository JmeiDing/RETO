The report describes a series of cyberattacks targeting Israeli and Palestinian organizations that have been ongoing for at least a year. The attacks involve malicious software that communicates with the same command and control infrastructure, suggesting they are conducted by the same threat actor. The attacks initially focused on Palestinian targets starting in late 2011, using emails with malicious attachments purporting to be documents on topics of interest. The malware used includes off-the-shelf remote access trojans like XtremeRat. In mid-2012, the attacks shifted towards Israeli targets, using similarly themed malicious attachments on topics like the Israeli military and government. Many of the malware samples are signed with the same fake digital certificate to evade detection. The command and control infrastructure was originally located in IP address ranges belonging to Palestinian ISPs in Gaza and the West Bank. More recently, the C&C has moved to US-based hosting providers. The report concludes that a sophisticated, long-running cyberespionage operation is underway, likely focused on surveillance. The threat actor is unknown but is clearly interested in regional politics and conflict. The use of commercial malware allows the attacks to be mounted at relatively low cost.
