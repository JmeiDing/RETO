Symantec has observed the North Korea-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) group Lazarus carrying out a cyberespionage campaign targeting chemical companies, likely to steal intellectual property. This appears to be a continuation of an operation dubbed "Dream Job" where Lazarus sends fake job offers to infect targets. Past campaigns targeted defense, government and engineering sectors. Recent attacks started with a malicious HTM filelikely delivered via email. It executes a signed Trojanized binary that downloads additional payloads from a command-and-control server. A chain of shellcode loaders is used to download more malware and arbitrary commands from the attackers. The payloads are Trojanized signed binaries like LZMA Utils library with added malicious exports. The attackers move laterally using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and steal credentials by dumping registry hives. Various persistence techniques are deployed using scheduled tasks and bat files. Post-compromise tools are deployed for screenshots, IP logging, remote access etc. The end goal appears to be cyberespionage and data exfiltration. A case study tracks the attackers' step-by-step activities over several days against an IT company and subsequent chemical sector targets. Tactics include using Living off the Land binaries, signing malicious files, scheduled tasks, service creation/deletion, and other techniques to evade detection. Symantec believes the Lazarus group is targeting the chemical sector to steal intellectual property and further North Korea's own chemical capabilities. Organizations should implement strong security to defend against such targeted attacks. In summary, this provides an analysis of Lazarus' latest campaign against the chemical industry likely aimed at cyberespionage, based on observed tactics, techniques and procedures.
