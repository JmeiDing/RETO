The document describes a large-scale cyberattack campaign targeting multiple Japanese companies and their subsidiaries globally. The attacks have been ongoing since at least October 2019 and are attributed to a Chinese state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) group called Cicada, also known as APT10 or Stone Panda. The attacks targeted companies in various industries like automotive, pharmaceutical, engineering, manufacturing, etc. The companies are linked to Japan or have Japanese partners. The attackers spent months inside some victim networks, stealing data and credentials. The attackers used a mix of custom and publicly available tools for reconnaissance, credential theft, file compression, lateral movement, and exfiltration. They leveraged legitimate cloud storage for data exfiltration. They heavily relied on DLL side-loading to hide malware in legitimate processes. The campaign also exploited the Windows ZeroLogon vulnerability disclosed and patched in 2020. Symantec discovered the campaign through a Cloud Analytics alert and was able to attribute it to Cicada based on code overlap with previous Cicada campaigns. Cicada is known to target Japan extensively and has links to the Chinese government. The campaign aims to steal confidential data for intelligence gathering. The report concludes that Japan-linked organizations globally remain at high risk from Cicada's sophisticated attacks. Comprehensive security solutions and threat hunting capabilities are required to detect such stealthy campaigns early. Defending against nation-state actors requires constant vigilance and rapid response.
