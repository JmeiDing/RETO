The document describes a point-of-sale malware campaign targeting retailers. It begins with a phishing email containing macros that download an initial reconnaissance implant. This is followed by deployment of a persistent backdoor called ShellTea and a memory-scraping POS malware called PoSlurp. ShellTea injects into Explorer and uses obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques. PoSlurp directly injects into targeted POS processes to steal payment card data. The report analyzes the technical details of the malware and provides mitigation recommendations focused on restricting macros, limiting exposed credentials, whitelisting, monitoring, and network segmentation.
