Here is a summary of the key points from the APT1 report: The report exposes a prolific Chinese cyber espionage group referred to as APT1. APT1 has been conducting cyber espionage since at least 2006, stealing hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations across 20 industries. The report provides extensive evidence linking APT1 to PLA Unit 61398 based in Shanghai. Key findings: - APT1 is believed to be the 2nd Bureau of the PLA General Staff Department's 3rd Department, known by its military unit cover designator Unit 61398. Unit 61398 is tasked by the Chinese government with conducting computer network operations and cyber espionage. - APT1 has systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations since 2006, including technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes, test results, business plans, pricing documents, partnership agreements, and emails. - APT1 maintains an extensive infrastructure of over 1,000 servers and has registered over 2,500 fully qualified domain names as part of their command and control framework. - Over 97% of the IP addresses used to control APT1's infrastructure are located in Shanghai and systems used by APT1 have Chinese language settings. - Three APT1 personas are exposed in the report: "UglyGorilla" involved since 2004, "DOTA" who used a Shanghai phone number to register email accounts, and "SuperHard" who disclosed being located in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai. - Unit 61398 requires its personnel be trained in computer security and network operations and be English proficient. It is located in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai. - The nature, expertise, infrastructure, and scale of APT1's operations match those of Unit 61398, leading to the conclusion that APT1 is Unit 61398 within the PLA. In summary, the report provides substantial evidence that APT1 is a Chinese state-sponsored cyber espionage unit with a broad mission to steal intellectual property from English-speaking organizations, particularly those related to China's strategic priorities.
