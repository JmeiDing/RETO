The PDF describes a Turla cyberespionage operation called WhiteBear that was active from 2016-2017. WhiteBear targeted foreign affairs entities and later defense organizations, primarily through watering hole attacks. The malware uses a complex malware platform with encrypted resource sections and registry storage for configuration. It injects into processes like Explorer. WhiteBear uses a unique RSA+3DES+Bzip2 encryption scheme not seen in other Turla malware. The private RSA key is stored in a non-standard format. The malware connects to command servers on compromised machines and hijacked satellite IP addresses. WhiteBear appears to be operated by a Russian-speaking developer based on language artifacts like debug strings. Infrastructure overlaps with other Turla campaigns but WhiteBear is a distinct subgroup with separate tools. WhiteBear diminished activity by mid-2017 but Turla campaigns continued through other subgroups with shifting targets. The report provides IOCs and Yara rules on WhiteBear.
