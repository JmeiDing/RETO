The PDF appears to be a federal grand jury indictment filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against three Chinese nationals - Jiang Lizhi, Qian Chuan, and Fu Qiang - for computer hacking and fraud offenses. The three defendants were employees and officers of a Chinese company called Chengdu 404 Network Technology Co., Ltd., which publicly claimed to provide cybersecurity services but also engaged in criminal hacking activities. The indictment alleges that from 2014 to 2020, the defendants conspired to hack into and steal data from over 100 victim companies, government agencies, universities, and non-profit organizations in the U.S. and around the world. They used phishing emails, malware, and other techniques to gain unauthorized access to computer networks and install backdoors. Once inside a network, they stole source code, software certificates, personal data, and other valuable information. They also conducted supply chain attacks by using their access to one company's network to then compromise the networks of that company's customers. The hackers also deployed ransomware to extort money from victims by encrypting data, and conducted cryptojacking schemes to hijack thousands of computers to mine cryptocurrency. The three defendants are charged with racketeering conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy, intentional damage to protected computers, identity theft, access device fraud, and money laundering. The indictment alleges they conducted these activities through their company Chengdu 404 to generate profits and gain commercial advantages. The hackers leased servers in the U.S. to carry out the attacks and stole credentials of U.S. employees to access company networks.
