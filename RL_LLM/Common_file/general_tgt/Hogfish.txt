The PDF is a threat analysis report by Accenture Security detailing campaigns by the APT10 hacking group, also known as HOGFISH or Stone Panda. It covers their attacks against Japanese organizations using the RedLeaves malware implants. The analysis examines a phishing document that drops a copy of the RedLeaves backdoor. The malware leverages the ALYac anti-virus software to stealthily load the payload which communicates with C2 servers. The implant can capture screenshots, steal credentials, execute commands and more. The report highlights other versions of the RedLeaves malware, their configurations and taunting messages targeting the Japan CERT. It maps out the associated infrastructure like domains, IP addresses and startup shortcut files. It also examines the workings of RedLeaves - its process injection, encryption, harvesting capabilities and command handling. The versions correspond to the "Lavender" variant according to code artifacts. The mitigation section recommends blocking the identified C2 domains and IP addresses. It suggests threat hunting across registry, filesystem and process artifacts associated with RedLeaves. In summary, the threat analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of the APT10 group's tactics like phishing, malware propagation, C2 communication as well as recommendations for detection and response. It offers in-depth insight into a sophisticated actor targeting organizations in Japan.
