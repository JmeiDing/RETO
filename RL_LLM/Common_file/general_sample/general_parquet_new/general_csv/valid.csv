"The blog post analyzes a recent macOS malware sample called NukeSped distributed by the North Korean Lazarus Group. It is delivered in two stages - first via a trojanized cryptocurrency app, then by downloading the backdoor NukeSped. The initial app Esilet uses an Electron framework and JavaScript to check for updates which downloads the next stage malware. NukeSped persists as a launch agent and uses libcurl networking APIs to communicate with command and control servers. Analysis of NukeSped shows it is a full-featured backdoor capable of surveying the system, executing arbitrary commands, reading/writing files, and more based on commands from the C2 server. The author demonstrates how existing macOS security tools like KnockKnock, BlockBlock, and LuLu detect the malware's behaviors like persistence and network connections even without prior knowledge of this new threat. The tools provide effective heuristic detection and can block the malware. ",valid_133,Esilet; JavaScript; code; Nukesped; Malware; a launch agent; control; servers; an survey; commands; files.
"Symantec analyzed a sophisticated malware called Seaduke used in targeted cyberespionage attacks. Seaduke is part of the ""Duke"" family of malware tools used by an advanced threat actor. Other tools include CozyDuke and MiniDuke. The group has been active since at least 2010, targeting government and diplomatic entities. Seaduke is reserved for high-value targets and used alongside CozyDuke for stealthy data exfiltration. The malware uses multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation to avoid detection. It has highly configurable capabilities. CozyDuke can install Seaduke via commands from the attacker's infrastructure. Seaduke C2 is separate. Seaduke features include system reconnaissance, file operations, self-deletion, and specialized payloads. The report speculates on the group's future plans to rework tools and infrastructure to continue long-term cyberespionage campaigns.
