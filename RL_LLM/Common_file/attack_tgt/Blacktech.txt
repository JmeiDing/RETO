1. BlackTech uses spearphishing emails containing malware as initial infection vector. The emails have document file attachments that use right-to-left override (RTLO) technique to disguise malware as documents. The emails also contain decoy documents to appear more legitimate. 2. If the user opens the attachment, it installs a malware loader component on the target system. 3. The loader component connects to a command and control (C&C) server to download the main malware/backdoor. 4. The backdoor then enables further functions like harvesting credentials, listing files/processes, executing files, etc. 5. BlackTech uses tools like DRIGO that search the infected system and exfiltrate targeted documents to the attacker's cloud storage accounts. 6. In some cases, if the attackers gain deeper access in the target's network, they install additional modular backdoors like Waterbear as secondary payload to maintain persistent presence. 7. The stolen documents provide insights into BlackTech's motives and targets. The type of documents focus on categories like defense, technology, government operations etc. 8. BlackTech continues to actively compromise targets using crafted spearphishing emails and evolving malware tools.
