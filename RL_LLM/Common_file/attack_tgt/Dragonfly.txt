Here are the key steps in the attack process by Dragony extracted from the PDF: 1. The group sends phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to compromise target systems. 2. They also use watering hole attacks to harvest credentials from websites relevant to the energy sector. 3. Once initial access is gained, Dragony will install backdoors like Heriplor and Karagany on systems. 4. The attackers use tools like PowerShell and credential theft malware to move laterally in the network. 5. Dragony appears to be gathering intelligence on operational and control systems, evidenced by screenshots of HMI interfaces. 6. In some cases they have trojanized legitimate software like Windows apps to deploy malware. 7. Backdoors and C2 channels are used to maintain persistence in the target networks. 8. No destructive actions have been observed yet, but the access and intel gathered by Dragony could enable future sabotage. 9. The group has remained active since 2011 against primarily Western energy companies and facilities. 10. Tactics like use of Russian code strings may be intended to mask Dragony's true origins and identity.
