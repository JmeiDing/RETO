1. The attack starts with a PowerShell dropper script that installs the initial malware. 2. The dropper decrypts and installs a rootkit driver for stealth. 3. It also installs a malicious service loader. 4. The service loader decrypts and executes an in-memory implant that facilitates C2 communication. 5. The implant retrieves additional payloads from the C2 server. 6. The payloads allow remote control, .NET assembly execution, PowerShell commands, and filesystem access. 7. The attackers use legitimate and custom tools for post-exploitation activities. 8. Tools are used to gather information, move laterally, and exfiltrate data from the compromised network.
