 1. The group sends spearphishing emails with DOC or DOCX attachments containing links to download remote templates. 2. When the attachment is opened, it downloads an RTF file containing a CVE-2017-11882 exploit. 3. The exploit executes shellcode that retrieves and launches an HTA file from a remote server. 4. The HTA file drops VBS scripts and an LNK file on the system. 5. The VBS scripts deobfuscate and execute the LNK file. 6. The LNK file downloads an encrypted loader executable. 7. The loader decrypts configuration data and the main malware payload. 8. The malware sends system info to the C2 and receives modules to run. 9. One module searches for and exfiltrates documents from the infected system back to the C2.
