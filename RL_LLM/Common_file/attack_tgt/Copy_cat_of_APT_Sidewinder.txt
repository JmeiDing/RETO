 1. The threat actor sent a spear phishing email with a weaponized RAR file attachment. 2. The RAR file contained a LNK file that when clicked would execute the dropper malware. 3. The dropper downloaded an HTA file from the domain vidyasagaracademybrg.in. 4. The HTA file downloaded and decoded a backdoor executable, saving it in the temp folder. 5. The backdoor was executed via sideloading, loading the malicious DUser.dll from the temp folder using a legitimate application. 6. DUser.dll executed the backdoor executable itstr.exe, establishing command and control communication. 7. The backdoor communicated via plain text protocol to the C2 server to receive commands and exfiltrate data from the compromised system. 8. The backdoor code itself matched an open-source remote access tool AllaKore_Remote. 9. The threat actor used the access to monitor and surveil the target system in Afghanistan.
