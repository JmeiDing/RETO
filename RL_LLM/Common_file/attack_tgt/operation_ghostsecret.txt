1. The attackers compromise websites and routers to use as watering holes and initial infection vectors. 2. The Proxysvc implant is installed silently on target machines to create backdoors over SSL on port 443. 3.

The malware gathers data from the infected system and exfiltrates it to command servers over SSL. 6. Bankshot and Destover can also spread laterally, install more implants, wipe systems, and execute arbitrary commands. 7. The command servers use SSL certificates linked to previous Hidden Cobra operations to control the implants.
