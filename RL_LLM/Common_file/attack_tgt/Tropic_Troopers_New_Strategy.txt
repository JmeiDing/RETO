1. Execute a command through exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802, security flaws in Microsoft Office’s Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE). 2. Download an installer package (.msi) and install it on the system by executing the command. 3. This system configuration file (in.sys) will drop a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) then delete itself. The backdoor installer will drop a normal sidebar.exe file (a Windows Gadget tool, a feature already discontinued by Windows), a malicious loader (in “C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\wab32res.dll“), and an encrypted configuration file. 4. UserInstall.exe will abuse the BITSadmin command-line tool to create a job and launch sidebar.exe. 5. The malicious loader will use dynamic-link library (DLL) hijacking — injecting malicious code into a process of a file/application — on sidebar.exe and launch dllhost.exe (a normal file). The loader will then inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.
