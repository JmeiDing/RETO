 1. A secretary at the company Black Gold opens a PDF attachment in an email. 2. The PDF is actually an executable that extracts and runs various scripts. 3. The scripts collect credentials from the local browser and email client and save them to text files. 4. The scripts disable the firewall, rename and upload the text files to an FTP server every hour. 5. Additional scripts run periodically to collect new credentials, delete old files, and maintain persistence. 6. Analysis of the FTP account used suggests the attack originates from Nigeria. 7. Over 80,000 stolen credentials are found on the FTP server from around 10 targeted companies. 8. The credentials are likely used to steal documents for Nigerian oil scams rather than attack the victim companies directly.
