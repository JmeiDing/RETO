1. The attacker gained initial administrative access to the ESXi hypervisors. 2. The attacker installed malicious VIBs on the hypervisors that deploy backdoors VIRTUALPITA and VIRTUALPIE. The VIBs were manipulated to appear legitimately signed. 3. The backdoors on the hypervisor create listeners for command execution, file transfers, etc. 4. Commands executed on the hypervisor are sent to guest VMs via vmtoolsd.exe for execution. 5. On the guest VMs, the attacker used vmtoolsd.exe for file enumeration, compression, and credential dumping. 6. Additional VIRTUALPITA samples were found on Linux vCenter systems. 7. Windows VMs hosted on the compromised hypervisors contained VIRTUALGATE for executing commands between VMs via VMCI sockets.
