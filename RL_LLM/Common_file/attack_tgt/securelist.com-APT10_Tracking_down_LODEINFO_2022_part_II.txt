Command and Control - LODEINFO implants a backdoor that connects to command and control servers to receive commands. 6. Expand Access - The backdoor can download additional payloads and tools to further compromise the system. 7. Exfiltrate Data - Data from the compromised system is exfiltrated back to the attacker's servers. 8. Persist Access - The backdoor ensures continued access to the system, allowing the attacker to maintain control. 9.
