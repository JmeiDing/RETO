 1. Ratsnif is typically deployed via spearphishing emails containing exploits or Trojan droppers. 2. Once executed, Ratsnif collects system information and sends it to the C2 server. 3. Ratsnif loads packet capture libraries and starts threads for ARP poisoning, DNS spoofing, and packet sniffing. 4. The ARP poisoning allows Ratsnif to intercept traffic intended for the default gateway. 5. DNS queries are spoofed to redirect requests to attacker controlled IPs. 6. Packet sniffing extracts credentials and other sensitive data which is logged to files. 7. C2 commands or configuration file options determine additional actions like HTTP injection.
