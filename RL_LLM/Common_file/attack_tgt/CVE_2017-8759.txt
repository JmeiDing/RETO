1. The attacker sends a malicious RTF document ("Проект.doc") to the target via spear phishing. 2. The document contains an embedded SOAP moniker that facilitates exploitation of CVE-2017-8759. 3. When opened, the moniker retrieves a malicious SOAP WSDL definition from the attacker's server. 4. The WSDL parser in .NET framework parses this data, allowing injection of arbitrary code. 5. The injected code generates a .cs source file that is compiled into a DLL loaded by Office. 6. The injected code launches mshta.exe to fetch a HTA script ("word.db") from the attacker's server. 7. The HTA script downloads the FINSPY malware executable "left.jpg". 8. FINSPY is placed in a location like %appdata% and executed. 9. FINSPY connects to its C2 server to receive commands from the attacker. 10. The attacker leverages FINSPY's capabilities like exfiltration, command execution, etc. to further penetrate the target.
