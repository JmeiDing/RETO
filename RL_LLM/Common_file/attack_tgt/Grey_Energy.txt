 1. GreyEnergy threat actors conduct reconnaissance on targets in the energy and critical infrastructure sectors. 2. Spearphishing emails or compromises of public-facing web servers are used to gain initial access. 3. GreyEnergy malware payloads are delivered onto systems and deployed in stages. 4. Backdoors and lightweight internal proxies are established to enable persistent remote access. 5. Additional modules are pushed to compromised hosts for espionage and data theft. 6. Screenshots, keylogs, credentials, and other data are exfiltrated via encrypted C2 channels. 7. Operators cover their tracks by securely wiping artifacts from systems before exiting. 8. Infrastructure analysis reveals links between GreyEnergy and previous BlackEnergy/TeleBots activity. 9. The recent activity suggests preparation for future disruptive attacks on critical infrastructure.
