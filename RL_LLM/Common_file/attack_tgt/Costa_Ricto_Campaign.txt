 1. Initial access obtained via stolen credentials, likely through phishing. 2. SSH tunnels created to proxy C2 traffic and evade detection. 3. SombRAT malware delivered via scheduled tasks executing PowerShell or CostaBricks loader. 4. Encrypted C2 occurs over DNS tunneling or HTTPS with subdomain generated by DGA. 5. SombRAT collects system info and downloads additional payloads from C2 server. 6. Plugins executed for further reconnaissance, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. 7. Exfiltrated data stored in custom encrypted format before sending to attackers. 8. Varied tools enable discovery, credential theft, process control, and proxying. 9. Campaigns adapted to different intrusions with evolving tactics to fulfill objectives. 10. Final goal is cyber-espionage through persistent access to compromise high-value targets.
