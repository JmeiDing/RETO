 1. APT32 sends spear phishing emails with weaponized Office document attachments. 2. The documents contain VB macros created using the StrikeSuit Gift toolkit. 3. When victims enable macros, the malware executes. 4. Macros use PowerShell scripts and scheduled tasks to download additional payloads. 5. Payloads inject shellcode into other processes using techniques like process hollowing. 6. Shellcode decrypts and executes final backdoor or RAT payloads. 7. Backdoors communicate with command servers to exfiltrate data. 8. StrikeSuit Gift macros collect system info, record audio/video, log keystrokes, etc. 9. Obfuscation routines in StrikeSuit Gift hide strings and API calls. 10. Macros use randomized strings and fake words to blend in and evade detection.
