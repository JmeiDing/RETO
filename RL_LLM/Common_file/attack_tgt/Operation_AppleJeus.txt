1. Lazarus distributed a fake cryptocurrency trading application called Celas Trade Pro containing malware. It was distributed for Windows and macOS. 2. When installed, the trading app installer launched a malicious updater module. 3. The updater collected system information and sent it to a Lazarus command and control server. 4. The server responded with encrypted data that the updater decrypted. This downloaded the Fallchill malware loader. 5. The Fallchill loader extracted and decrypted the final Fallchill backdoor payload from other files. 6. Fallchill provided remote access and control of the infected machine to Lazarus. It could collect data, execute commands, upload files, and more. 7. Fallchill connected to Lazarus command and control servers that were linked to servers used in prior attacks.
