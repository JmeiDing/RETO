1. Attacks utilize legitimate TeamViewer installation signed with a code signing certificate. 2. The signed installer deploys TeamViewer along with a malicious DLL (avicap32.dll). 3. The DLL hijacks TeamViewer using an encrypted config file that contains C2 settings. 4. The DLL secretly controls the victim's TeamViewer application for remote access. 5. Other custom malware tools are deployed through additional droppers and installers. 6. Malware capabilities include system enumeration, document stealing, keylogging, screenshots, etc. 7. Stolen data is encrypted and exfiltrated to C2 servers without touching disk. 8. C2 communications use encrypted protocols with custom alphabets. 9. Infrastructure analysis revealed domains, IPs, and statistics tying operations together. 10. Campagins utilized cybercrime malware like Sheldor previously for financial gain. 11. Victimology focuses on high-profile diplomatic and government targets. 12. Attacks have evaded detection for nearly a decade, reinventing tools and infrastructure over time.
