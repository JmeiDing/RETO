1. The attack starts with a phishing email containing a malicious Excel sheet. 2. The Excel sheet contains obfuscated macros that execute if the victim enables macros. 3. The macro fetches an encrypted and packed second-stage downloader. 4. The downloader executes periodic checks and then fetches the encrypted third stage. 5. The third stage decrypts the configuration and final LokiBot payload. 6. It escalates privileges using two different UAC bypass techniques. 7. LokiBot is injected into a process using process hollowing and executed. 8. LokiBot then functions as an information stealer under the attacker's control.
