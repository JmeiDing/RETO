 1. Initial infection via spearphishing emails or other vectors. The malware loader component is installed on the victim's system. 2. The loader decrypts and executes malware modules stored in encrypted executable blobs. 3. Various modules are deployed that perform specific functions: - Keylogging module logs keystrokes and extracts sensitive data. - Network modules listen for encrypted C2 traffic over various protocols. - Exfiltration modules send collected data to attacker controlled servers. - Updater modules download additional plugins or updated versions. 4. The attacker communicates with infected hosts via compromised PHP scripts on websites or direct network connections. Commands and new modules are pushed to infected hosts. 5. Sensitive documents, keylogs, screenshots etc. are exfiltrated from infected hosts back to the attacker. 6. Additional modules can be deployed on demand to gather further intelligence or deploy custom tools. 7. Variants use UAC bypass techniques to gain admin privileges on hosts. 8. Modular framework allows flexible capabilities tailored to attackers' needs. Encryption and stealth helps evade detection. 9. Life-long persistence and control over compromised hosts supports long-term cyber espionage operations.
