 1. The attackers send a malicious WPS Office updater to infect the victim's machine. They exploit a vulnerability in the wpsupdate.exe updater to download and execute arbitrary code. 2. The downloaded malicious executable drops and executes two files - a signed executable QMSpeedupRocketTrayInjectHelper64.exe and a malicious DLL QMSpeedupRocketTrayStub64.dll. 3. The DLL backdoor contacts a C2 server and downloads the next stage executable icbc_logtmp.exe. 4. The second dropper icbc_logtmp.exe escalates privileges and drops multiple binaries including the loader log.dll (CoreX). 5. The loader decrypts and loads the core module DLL Proto8 which sets up the working directory and configuration files. 6. The core module collects system info, sets up call objects, and connects to C2 servers sending an initial beacon. It can receive commands to load plugins. 7. The plugins like CorePlugin, Zload, and MecGame achieve persistence, bypass UAC, create backdoor accounts, etc. 8. The MulCom backdoor module provides remote access capabilities with 15 supported commands like file/directory operations, process creation, data exfiltration etc. It communicates with the C2 server using encrypted protocols. 9. The attackers use the installed backdoors and plugins to maintain persistence and control over the infected system.
