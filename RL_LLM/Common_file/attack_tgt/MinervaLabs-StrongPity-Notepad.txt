1. The threat actor spreads a Trojanized Notepad++ installer. 2. The victim downloads and executes the malicious Notepad++ installer. 3. The installer drops the legitimate Notepad++, a keylogger (ntuis32.exe), and a remote access tool (winpickr.exe). 4. The installer also installs a persistent service to re-execute the remote access tool at startup. 5. The keylogger records keystrokes to a hidden file. 6. The remote access tool periodically checks for new keystroke log files. 7. The remote access tool exfiltrates any found log files to the C2 server. 8. After exfiltration, the remote access tool deletes the local log file.
