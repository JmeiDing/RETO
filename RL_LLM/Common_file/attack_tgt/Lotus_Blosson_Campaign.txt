1. The attack starts with a spear-phishing email containing a malicious Office document. 2. If the document is opened, an exploit is used to execute the ESILE dropper. 3. The dropper installs the ESILE backdoor, either as a service or via an autorun registry entry. 4. ESILE contacts its command and control server using a dynamic URL based on the victim's MAC address and current time. 5. The attacker can then send commands to the infected machine via the C2 channel.
