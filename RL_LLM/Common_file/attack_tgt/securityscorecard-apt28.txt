1. APT28 threat actors create weaponized documents exploiting the Follina vulnerability. 2. The documents are distributed via phishing or other tactics to victims in Ukraine. 3. A victim opens the document, triggering the download of the CredoMap .NET stealer. 4. CredoMap connects to a hardcoded C2 server via IMAP protocol on port 143. 5. The stealer logs in using hardcoded credentials and selects the INBOX folder. 6. CredoMap steals credentials and cookies from Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers on the infected system. 7. The stealer decrypts any encrypted credentials using DPAPI and AES-GCM. 8. The extracted data is serialized to JSON strings. 9. The data is exfiltrated by sending IMAP APPEND commands to the C2 masquerading as emails. 10. CredoMap cleans up by deleting copies of extracted browser files. 11. APT28 operators collect the stolen credential and browser data from the C2. 12. Access can be exploited for further intrusion, data theft, and other objectives.
