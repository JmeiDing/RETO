1. The attacker researches potential targets and crafts spear phishing emails with relevant subject lines and content. 2. Malicious attachments exploiting software vulnerabilities are attached, often using Right-to-Left override techniques to mask extensions. 3. When the target opens the attachment, the exploit triggers and installs a loader Trojan like CrypticConvo. 4. The loader Trojan decrypts and installs the FakeM backdoor. 5. FakeM connects to the C2 server, sends system info, and awaits commands. 6. The attacker sends commands to perform actions like keylogging, uploading files, and installing further modules. 7. FakeM exfiltrates any collected data back to the attacker's server. 8. The attacker analyzes the exfiltrated data and sends further commands or crafts new spear phishing attacks. 9. In some cases, a watering hole attack is used instead of spear phishing to infect visitors of a compromised site.
