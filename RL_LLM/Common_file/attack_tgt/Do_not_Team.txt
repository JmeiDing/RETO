1. The victim receives a phishing email with a malicious Microsoft Word document attachment. 2. The Word document abuses the external element autoloading capability to load an RTF document that exploits CVE-2018-0802 to execute shellcode. 3. The shellcode decrypts and drops two malicious loaders named Serviceflow.exe and sinter.exe. It also escalates privileges using a modified version of UACMe. 4. The loaders establish persistence by creating shortcuts in the startup folder to execute after reboot. 5. The watchdog loader Serviceflow.exe collects system information and sends it to the attacker's command server. 6. The sinter.exe loader contacts the command server and can download additional modules like the yty spying framework. 7. The yty framework allows the attackers to gather more data from the victim system, like files, keystrokes, screenshots, etc. 8. The attackers use rented servers at DigitalOcean and domain names registered with privacy services to hide their infrastructure.
