1. The attack begins with a spear-phishing email containing a malicious Excel attachment. 2. The Excel document contains macros that are initially disabled. It displays instructions for the user to enable macros. 3. If the victim enables macros, hidden decoy content is displayed to avoid suspicion. 4. The macro installs the Helminth script variant by dropping VBScript and PowerShell files and creating a scheduled task to execute them. 5. The VBScript reaches out to the C2 server via HTTP to download and execute scripts. It uploads results back to the C2. 6. The PowerShell script communicates with the C2 via DNS queries to receive data that is parsed into a batch script and executed. Results are exfiltrated via DNS. 7. In the executable Helminth variant, a dropper installs the malware which persists via a shortcut in the startup folder. 8. The executable variant connects to the C2 via HTTP and DNS like the script version. It also contains a keylogger module. 9. The keylogger saves keystrokes and clipboard data to a file for exfiltration.
