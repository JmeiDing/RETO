1. The threat actor sends a phishing email containing a VB script attachment. 2. The victim executes the VB script which loads and decrypts an obfuscated PowerShell script. 3. The PowerShell script checks for sandboxing and gathers system info to fingerprint the victim. 4. It fetches the next stage PowerShell code from Pastebin or top4top. 5. The next PowerShell stage compiles embedded RunPE code at runtime. 6. RunPE is used to hollow a process and inject the final RAT payload from NYANxCAT or other RAT. 7. The RAT payload communicates with its C2 server to enable further malicious activity. 8. An upgraded browser stealer module uses separate executables to steal Chrome and Firefox data. 9. A new reverse shell module implemented as a DLL backdoors the system. 10. Snip3 maintains persistent access to the compromised machine for the threat actor.
