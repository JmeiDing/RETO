1. The attacker creates a malicious XLL file, often using a framework like Excel-DNA. 2. The XLL implements exports like xlAutoOpen that will execute code when opened. 3. The attacker emails the victim an XLL file, disguised as an invoice, report, etc. 4. The victim receives the email and opens the attached XLL file. 5. Excel displays a warning prompt about the XLL containing code. 6. If the victim allows/enables the code, the xlAutoOpen export executes. 7. The xlAutoOpen code typically downloads next stage payloads. 8. The downloaded malware executes, compromising the system. 9. The malware establishes persistence and connects to a C2 server. 10. The attacker can then leverage the malware for further objectives.
