1. Initial infection via phishing email or other vector like exploit kits. The phishing emails are sent by botnets like CraP2P/Necurs and Cutwail controlled by Dridex operators or affiliates. 2. The phishing email contains a malicious attachment or link. If opened/clicked, it downloads the Dridex loader module. 3. The loader installs the main Dridex payload and additional modules. It also downloads an initial peer list to connect to the command and control infrastructure. 4. Dridex collects reconnaissance and gathers credentials via keylogging, web injections into banking sites, etc. 5. The stolen banking credentials are leveraged by the operators to perform unauthorized bank transfers and steal money. 6. In some cases, Dridex may download additional payloads like ransomware onto compromised machines. 7. The peer-to-peer botnet infrastructure helps preserve anonymity of the command servers and bolster resilience. 8. Affiliates pay Evil Corp to use subsets of the Dridex botnets and botnet IDs for distribution. Revenue is shared. 9. Dridex continues evolving with new modules, exploits, obfuscation, and evasion techniques to sustain operations.
