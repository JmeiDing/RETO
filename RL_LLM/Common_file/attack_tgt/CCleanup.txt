 1. The attackers compromised a portion of the development or build environment at Piriform, the company that makes CCleaner. 2. The attackers inserted malware into the CCleaner v5.33 binary that was digitally signed using a valid certificate issued to Piriform. 3. The infected CCleaner v5.33 was hosted on the official CCleaner download servers and distributed to users between August 15 and September 12, 2017. 4. When users installed CCleaner v5.33, the installer executed the malicious payload which collected system information and exfiltrated it to a C2 server. 5. The malware used a hardcoded C2 domain that appeared legitimate (speccy.piriform.com) and HTTPS requests to conceal C2 traffic. 6. The malware had a DGA algorithm to generate new C2 domains if the primary C2 went down. Cisco registered the DGA domains to sinkhole the traffic. 7. The malware payload was heavily obfuscated - encrypted, encoded with modified Base64, headers wiped, anti-analysis checks, etc. 8. The attackers could send new payloads to infected hosts by responding to check-ins from the malware. 9. Due to the widespread use of CCleaner, the attackers could have compromised a massive number of systems rapidly.
