Here are the key steps in the attack process described in the PDF: 1. KillDisk variant is dropped on the system, possibly by another process or attacker. Its file path is hardcoded. 2. KillDisk renames itself to hide its presence. 3. KillDisk starts deleting files by first renaming them randomly, then overwriting chunks of the files with 0x00 bytes, and finally deleting them. 4. KillDisk overwrites the MBR of storage devices with 0x00 bytes to damage partitions. It also overwrites the EBR and partitions pointed to by extended partitions. 5. After a hardcoded wait time, KillDisk forcefully reboots the system by terminating critical system processes csrss.exe, wininit.exe, winlogon.exe, and lsass.exe. 6. The forced reboot is intended to cause a Blue Screen of Death or force the user to reboot the machine.
