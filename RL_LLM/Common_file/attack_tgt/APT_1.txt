 1. Conduct reconnaissance on targets to gather information like email addresses that will be useful in crafting spearphishing messages. 2. Register domain names, set up command and control infrastructure like servers, and stage malicious files on servers or file hosting sites. 3. Send spearphishing emails to targets with attachments or links to download malware. 4. If emails are opened and links/attachments accessed, initial malware like WEBC2 or beachhead backdoors are installed on target systems. 5. Initial malware connects out to command and control servers to download additional payloads. 6. Further backdoors and tools are used to escalate privileges, move laterally within networks, and gather credentials. 7. Reconnaissance is done on compromised systems to locate sensitive documents and data. 8. Tools gather documents, emails, files from compromised systems. Data is compressed and archived. 9. Stolen data is exfiltrated from target networks back to servers controlled by the attackers. 10. New backdoors and tools are continually installed to maintain persistence in case of detection. 11. The cycle repeats to steal additional data from target organizations over months or years. So in summary, it follows a recurring attack lifecycle of initial compromise, installing malware, escalating access, gathering data, and exfiltrating the stolen data.
