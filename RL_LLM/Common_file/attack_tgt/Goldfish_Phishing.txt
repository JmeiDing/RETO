 1. Rocket Kitten sends spearphishing emails with malicious Office documents to targets. 2. If the user enables macros, the documents drop a malware called GHOLE. 3. GHOLE communicates with command and control servers to exfiltrate data from the infected system. 4. In more recent attacks, emails contain links to OneDrive hosting malicious executables disguised as documents. 5. If the user clicks the link and executes the file, it installs a keylogger called CWoolger. 6. CWoolger logs keystrokes and sends the stolen data back to Rocket Kitten's servers. 7. The group uses the data for espionage and surveillance of high-value targets.
