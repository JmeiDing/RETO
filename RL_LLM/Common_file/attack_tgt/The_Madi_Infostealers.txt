 1. Attackers send spearphishing emails with malicious PDF attachments. 2. If the PDF is opened on a vulnerable version of Adobe Reader, it exploits a code execution vulnerability. 3. A dropper executable (ctfmon.exe) is installed on the system. 4. The dropper installs the main data-stealing module (mspmsnsr.dll) as a malicious Windows service. 5. The malware collects system information and connects to a command and control server. 6. It receives encrypted commands from the C2 server to perform various actions. 7. Actions include capturing screens, keystrokes, audio, listing files, uploading exfiltrated data, etc. 8. Exfiltrated documents are encrypted and encoded before being sent to the C2. 9. The malware uses social engineering techniques and fake files to avoid detection. 10. Campaign IDs track infections from specific malware file instances.
