 1. Cloud Atlas sends spearphishing emails with malicious Office document attachments to high-value targets. 2. The documents contain links to remote templates hosted on attacker servers. 3. When the document is opened, it retrieves the remote template, which contains exploit code. 4. The exploit (CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802) executes a polymorphic HTA file. 5. The HTA file drops and executes the VBShower VBS implant. 6. VBShower establishes registry persistence, deletes forensic artifacts, and retrieves a PowerShower PowerShell implant. 7. PowerShower can retrieve additional modules from the attackers for specific functionality. 8. VBShower also retrieves and executes a VBS script that installs the Cloud Atlas modular backdoor. 9. The backdoor communicates with attacker command servers via WebDAV for further control, data exfiltration, etc.
