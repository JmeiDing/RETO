1. Initial Infection: TAIDOOR is installed on the victim's system as a DLL file, either through social engineering or by exploiting system vulnerabilities. 2. Loader Execution: The loader DLL file is started as a Windows service. It locates and decrypts the main RAT payload using a RC4 encryption algorithm. 3. RAT Execution: The decrypted RAT payload is loaded into memory and its exports are called to kick off the main malware functionality. 4. Initialization: The RAT initializes by decrypting API function names and other strings needed for operation using a custom stream cipher algorithm. 5. Configuration: An encrypted config file containing C2 servers is decrypted using the AES algorithm. 6. Reconnaissance: The malware gathers system info like adapter, OS, and event log data. 7. Command and Control: The RAT connects to hard-coded C2 servers over port 443 to receive commands from the attacker. Communications are encrypted. 8. Execution: Based on commands from the C2 server, the RAT can download additional payloads, execute shell commands, manipulate files, connect to plugins, etc. 9. Persistence: The malware creates artifacts on the system to maintain its foothold after reboot. 10. Data Exfiltration: The RAT sends information about the infected system back to the attacker-controlled C2 server.
