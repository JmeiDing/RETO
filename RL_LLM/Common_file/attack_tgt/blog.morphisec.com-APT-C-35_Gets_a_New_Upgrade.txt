1. The threat actor sends spear phishing emails with weaponized document attachments, often exploiting vulnerabilities like Equation Editor. 2. When documents are opened, macros are enabled which execute a shellcode loader. 3. The shellcode loader decrypts and executes the first stage shellcode downloaded from the C2. 4. The first stage shellcode decrypts and executes the second stage shellcode. 5. The second stage shellcode checks for antivirus software and executes routines to evade detection. 6. The shellcode executes the main DLL component which installs persistence and beacons to the C2. 7. The C2 sends the next loader module which fetches the C2 address from Google Drive. 8. The loader downloads and executes modules configured by the C2 like keyloggers, file collectors, reverse shells, etc. 9. An upgraded browser stealer module uses separate executables to steal Chrome and Firefox data. 10. A new reverse shell module implemented as a DLL creates a backdoor access point for the threat actor. 11. The malware continues communicating with the C2 to enable long-term access and data exfiltration.
