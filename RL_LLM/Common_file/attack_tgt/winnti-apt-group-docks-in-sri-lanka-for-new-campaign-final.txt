 1. Attackers distributed an ISO file titled "economic assistance.iso" masquerading as information on economic aid. 2. The ISO contains a LNK shortcut that executes a file des.exe, which sideloads a malicious DLL ofcpic.dll. 3. The ofcpic.dll DLL decodes and executes shellcode for a custom backdoor named DBoxAgent. 4. DBoxAgent uses the Dropbox API for command and control to exfiltrate data and download additional payloads. 5. A second stage payload SerialVlogger decrypts and loads a separate payload vlog.ipdb. 6. The vlog.ipdb payload decrypts and injects the final KeyPlug remote access malware. 7. KeyPlug allows the attackers to fully control the compromised systems using WebSockets.
