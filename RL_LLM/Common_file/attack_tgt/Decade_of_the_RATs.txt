1. The groups send spear-phishing emails with LNK files that execute malware infection chains leading to Linux backdoors and rootkits. 2. The backdoors communicate with command and control servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data. 3. An online build system compiles customized rootkits tailored to the victim's kernel version. 4. The rootkits mask the backdoors to avoid detection and maintain persistence. 5. Lancer installation scripts remotely deploy the backdoors and rootkits. 6. The PWNLNX5 controller manages infected systems and issues commands. 7. The groups steal certificates from adware companies to sign Windows malware, bypassing scrutiny as routine adware alerts. 8. Android implants enable mobile device monitoring and exfiltration alongside traditional malware. 9. The groups share infrastructure and tools, indicating coordination in targeting multiple platforms. 10. Ongoing tool evolution, infrastructure shifts to cloud services, and tactical adaptations allow the groups to keep operating undetected.
