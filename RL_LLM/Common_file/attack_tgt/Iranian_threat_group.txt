1. The attackers distributed macro-enabled documents purporting to be from government agencies. 2. If the victim enables macros, it drops and executes scripts. 3. The scripts install the POWERSTATS backdoor through indirect code execution techniques. 4. The backdoor establishes C2 communications using RSA encryption. 5. It gathers system information from the compromised host. 6. The backdoor can take screenshots, run commands, and more on the infected system. 7. The macros also create scheduled tasks for persistence on the system. 8. The backdoor code includes anti-analysis measures to detect security tools and shut down. 9. It uses a large proxy network to mask C2 communications.
