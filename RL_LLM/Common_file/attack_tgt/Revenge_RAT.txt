 1. The attacker sends a weaponized Word DOCX document named "Rooming List Reservas para 3 Familias.docx" 2. The document fetches a remote template file from the attacker's server 3. The template executes an embedded malicious Excel XLSM file containing VBA macros 4. The macros execute a PowerShell script hosted at hxxp://azulviagens[.]online/A.txt 5. The PowerShell script downloads index.mp3 from the server and saves it as index.vbs 6. index.vbs creates opera.vbs and opera.ps1 on the victim system 7. opera.vbs executes opera.ps1, which contains the obfuscated Revenge RAT payload 8. The RAT payload executes on the victim machine and connects to the attacker's command and control server
