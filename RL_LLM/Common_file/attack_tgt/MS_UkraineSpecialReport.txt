Here are the key steps of the attack process described in the PDF: 1. Russian threat actors conduct spearphishing campaigns, exploit unpatched systems, or compromise upstream suppliers to gain initial access. 2. Actors use valid credentials and administrative tools to move laterally in networks. 3. Groups perform reconnaissance and surveil networks to enable persistent access. 4. Actors collect and exfiltrate sensitive data from compromised networks. 5. Groups deploy wiper malware to destroy data and disrupt operations at critical times. 6. Threat actors cover their tracks by modifying logs, deleting files, and other cleanup activities. 7. Russia-aligned groups continuously modify their malware and tactics to evade defenses.
