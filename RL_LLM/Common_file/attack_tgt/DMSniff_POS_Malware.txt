1. DMSniff gains initial access to POS devices through brute force SSH attacks or exploiting vulnerabilities. 2. Once installed on a POS device, DMSniff scans through running processes and memory to find credit card numbers. 3. When card data is discovered, DMSniff extracts the track 1 and track 2 data before it is encrypted. 4. The stolen card data is packaged and exfiltrated to the attacker's command and control infrastructure. 5. DMSniff uses a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to rapidly generate C2 domain names, avoiding takedowns. 6. The attacker accesses the C2 panel written in PHP to view and download the stolen credit card reports. 7. After the data is retrieved by the attacker, it is deleted from the panel but likely stored elsewhere for sale or abuse. 8. DMSniff regularly checks in with the C2 server, encoding key data like process ID to avoid detection. 9. The C2 can send commands to be executed on infected POS devices for additional manipulation. 10. DMSniff uses simple string encoding to obfuscate its capabilities and evade detection by security tools.
