 1. ZINC actors create fake LinkedIn profiles posing as recruiters to connect with targets. 2. Actors encourage targets to communicate further over WhatsApp. 3. Actors send weaponized software like PuTTY and KiTTY over WhatsApp. The software itself does not contain malware initially. 4. The software requires the target to connect to specific IP addresses provided by the actor. This triggers the malware installation. 5. The installed malware sends system information to the command and control server as part of initial check-in. 6. The malware allows the actor to install additional malware on the compromised system via the C2 communication. 7. Persistence is achieved using scheduled tasks or DLL hijacking techniques. 8. The malware uses encoded or encrypted C2 traffic to blend in with legitimate traffic.
