When the Excel file is opened, the macro decrypts and extracts an executable archive file. 4. The executable archive contains multiple RAT payloads and installs the one compatible with the system's .NET version. 5. The installed RAT payload executes and connects to a command and control server. 6. The RAT exfiltrates data from the infected system back to the command and control server.
