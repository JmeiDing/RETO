1. Initial Access: On September 3, attackers gained initial access by likely exploiting vulnerabilities in the Lua scripts route.lua or index.lua on the National Games website. 2. Establish Foothold: The attackers uploaded various reverse shell scripts like runscript.lua, conf.lua, and admin2.php to maintain persistent access. 3. Reconnaissance: The attackers spent time figuring out what file types could be uploaded and testing different webshells. 4. Attempt Server Reconfiguration: The attackers tried to reconfigure the web server to better execute their malware but were unsuccessful. 5. Deploy Malware: The attackers ultimately uploaded a weaponized Tomcat server with the Rebeyond Behinder webshell. 6. Internal Reconnaissance: The attackers used a custom Chinese exploitation framework written in Go to scan the internal network and identify potential targets. 7. Lateral Movement: The framework had plugins to exploit vulnerabilities and brute force passwords to compromise additional systems on the network. 8. Incident Resolution: Avast states the breach was successfully resolved by the National Games IT team prior to the start of the event.
