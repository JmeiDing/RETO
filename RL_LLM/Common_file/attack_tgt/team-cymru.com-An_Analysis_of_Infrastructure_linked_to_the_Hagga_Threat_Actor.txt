1. Researchers started by analyzing a single IP address and C2 directory pattern associated with distributing Agent Tesla malware. 2. Passive DNS analysis of the initial IP revealed hosting of a C2 domain. 3. SSL certificate data tied the initial IP to other IPs hosting the same certificate. 4. C2 traffic patterns and Mana Tools login pages connected the IPs to Hagga infrastructure. 5. Open ports analysis indicated the C2s run on Windows servers likely using XAMPP web servers. 6. A backend MySQL server was identified, receiving traffic from the C2 IPs. 7. Continued monitoring of the MySQL server revealed new IPs contacting it, attributed to Hagga. 8. New Hagga C2 domains were identified through Passive DNS associations with the MySQL server. 9. Malbeacon telemetry ultimately tied activity back to IP addresses around Lahore, Pakistan. 10. Ongoing monitoring of the MySQL server enabled rapid discovery of new Hagga infrastructure. 11. Fingerprinting of SSL certificates and C2 patterns enabled attribution of new infrastructure to Hagga.
