1. Infection starts with a spearphishing email containing a malicious attachment. Common lures include documents with tempting filenames related to political issues. 2. The attachment is a dropper executable that displays a decoy document to the victim. In the background, it installs the malware modules. 3. The dropper adds persistence using DLL load order hijacking techniques. 4. The persistence module loads the core module, which handles C&C communication. 5. The core module reaches out to a command server to download additional functional modules. 6. These modules perform different surveillance activities like capturing screenshots, keystrokes, documents, etc. 7. The core module periodically collects stolen data saved in log files by the modules. 8. The core module encrypts and exfiltrates the log files to attacker-controlled servers. 9. The attackers connect to the C&C servers to collect the exfiltrated data and issue new commands.
