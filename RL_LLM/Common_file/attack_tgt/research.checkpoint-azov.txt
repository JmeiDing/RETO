1. Azov is distributed as a payload of the SmokeLoader botnet through fake cracked software and pirate sites. 2. It uses weaponized documents with malicious macros to gain initial access. 3. Once executed, Azov establishes persistence by backdooring system binaries like msiexec.exe. 4. It has a logic bomb set to trigger wiping at a specified time. 5. The wiping routine iterates directories to find and wipe files in 666 byte blocks. 6. Azov also backdoors .exe files using polymorphic code to evade detection. 7. The backdoored executables help spread Azov laterally when executed. 8. No network traffic or data exfiltration occurs during the attack. The goal is destruction.
