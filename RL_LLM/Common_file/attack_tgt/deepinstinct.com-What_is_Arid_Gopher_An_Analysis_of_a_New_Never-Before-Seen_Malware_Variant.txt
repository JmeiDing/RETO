1. The attacker distributes the Arid Gopher malware bundled with a benign decoy document such as a Word or PDF file. 2. If the victim opens the file, Arid Gopher displays the decoy document to appear benign. 3. In the background, Arid Gopher establishes persistence by creating a shortcut in the Startup folder to run on boot. 4. Arid Gopher collects system information like OS version, AV products, hostname, username, etc. 5. The malware takes a screenshot of the infected system. 6. Arid Gopher sends the collected system info and screenshot to its command and control server. 7. The C2 server sends back commands that Arid Gopher executes, such as taking more screenshots, running commands, or downloading additional payloads. 8. If 360 Total Security is detected, Arid Gopher downloads and executes the Arid Helper malware to set up alternate persistence mechanisms. 9. Arid Gopher may also download second-stage payloads from the C2 server, such as a C++ executable observed by the researchers. 10. Arid Gopher receives ongoing commands from the C2 server to carry out the attacker's objectives on the victim's machine.
