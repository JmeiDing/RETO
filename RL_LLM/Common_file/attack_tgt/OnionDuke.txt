 1. The user downloads an executable file through a compromised Tor exit node. 2. The exit node modifies the executable and embeds the original file within a malware wrapper. 3. When executed, the wrapper runs the original executable for deception and also extracts and runs the OnionDuke dropper. 4. The dropper decrypts and executes the OnionDuke backdoor DLL. 5. The backdoor connects to command and control servers and can download additional components. 6. Other modules like credential stealers are executed and communicate via the backdoor.
