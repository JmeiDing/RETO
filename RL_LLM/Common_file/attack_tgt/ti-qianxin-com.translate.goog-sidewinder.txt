 1. Send spearphishing emails with document attachments as lures, impersonating organizations relevant to the target. 2. The document attachment does not contain macros, but uses remote template injection to download an RTF file. 3. The RTF file exploits CVE-2017-11882 to execute malicious shellcode. 4. The shellcode downloads and executes obfuscated JavaScript payload from the file 1.a. 5. The JavaScript decrypts and reflectively loads a .NET DLL file called App.dll. 6. App.dll downloads another obfuscated JavaScript file from a command and control server. 7. The second JavaScript file reflects a remote access trojan DLL that opens a backdoor on the infected system. 8. The backdoor allows the attacker to remotely execute commands on the victim's machine.
