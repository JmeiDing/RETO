 1. Attackers send spearphishing emails with Game of Thrones lures and malicious Word docs containing embedded shortcuts. 2. The shortcuts execute PowerShell scripts that download and decode two payloads. 3. One payload is 9002 RAT shellcode which is injected into wabmig.exe. 4. The other payload is a shortcut file placed in Startup for persistence, which loads the 9002 shellcode. 5. 9002 RAT connects to its command and control server and can perform extensive surveillance actions. 6. It uses HTTP requests with custom encoding to communicate with the C2 server. 7. Fake SSL connections are also initiated to login.live.com domains.
