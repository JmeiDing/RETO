 1. In August 2016, CSIRT received reports of Android malware spreading in Libya via Telegram. 2. The malware was first discovered after a high-profile Telegram account was compromised from an IP address in Spain. 3. The attackers used the compromised account to spread malware disguised as a voice message to the account's contacts. 4. The malware was injected into a legitimate Android app called URLShortener. 5. The malware communicates with a C2 server at winmeif.myq-see.com and exfiltrates extensive data from devices. 6. CSIRT believes the malware has ties to known Android RATs like JSocket and AlienSpy. 7. CSIRT sinkholed the malware and analyzed the attacker infrastructure dating back to September 2015. 8. The campaign uses Windows and Android malware with evidence of non-sophisticated, likely Arabic speaking threat actors in Libya.
