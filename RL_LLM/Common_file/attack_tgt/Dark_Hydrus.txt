 1. The attackers send spear-phishing emails with password-protected RAR archives containing malicious .iqy files. 2. The target opens the RAR archive and enters the provided password to extract the .iqy file. 3. When the .iqy file is opened in Excel, it retrieves a remote PowerShell script from a command and control server. 4. The PowerShell payload communicates with the C2 server using DNS tunneling to receive commands and exfiltrate data. 5. The payload checks for sandbox environments and attempts to achieve persistence on the system. 6. Commands allow the attackers to further explore the compromised network, escalate privileges, and exfiltrate sensitive data. 7. The modular payload components and infrastructure are reused across multiple campaigns going back to early 2016.
