1. TeamTNT uses scanners to obtain a list of target IP addresses and scan them for security weaknesses like exposed Docker APIs, unsecured Redis instances, vulnerable IoT devices, leaked credentials, and SSH accessibility. 2. If TeamTNT finds an exploitable security issue, they start delivering payloads to the victim systems. 3. Typical payloads include credential stealers, cryptocurrency miners, IRC bots for command and control, local network scanners, reverse/bind shells, and more. 4. The credential stealers search for and steal SSH, AWS, Docker API, and other credentials. These can then be used to spread the infection further. 5. The cryptocurrency miners are deployed for monetary gain. They often use rootkits like Diamorphine to hide the mining processes. 6. The IRC bots allow TeamTNT to remotely control infected machines and deploy additional payloads.
