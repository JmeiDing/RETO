1. The threat actor delivers the STEELCORGI malware to the victim system. 2. STEELCORGI is heavily packed and obfuscated to avoid detection. 3. The malware checks for a specific environment variable set by the operators. 4. If the variable is present, STEELCORGI unpacks itself using the key from the variable. 5. The decrypted payload provides an extensive menu of commands for reconnaissance and infiltration. 6. The operator executes commands for scanning, password attacks, cleaning logs, traffic spoofing, etc. 7. STEELCORGI allows the attacker to move laterally and operate undetected on the network. 8. The malware exfiltrates data collected during the operation back to the attackers. 9. STEELCORGI maintains persistence to enable long-term access to the compromised network. 10. The toolkit is updated over time with new exploits and capabilities.
