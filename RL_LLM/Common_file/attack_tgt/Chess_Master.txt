 1. The attack starts with a phishing email containing an exploit Office document. 2. The document abuses a .NET Framework vulnerability (CVE-2017-8759) to access a remote server. 3. When opened, the document executes code from the remote server img.db. 4. The executed code launches mshta.exe to access the backdoor at lK0RS. 5. The first backdoor lK0RS launches a malicious PowerShell script. 6. The PowerShell script downloads and activates the second backdoor located at FA347FEiwq.jpg. 7. The second backdoor BKDR_ANEL injects into svchost.exe and connects to its command and control server. 8. BKDR_ANEL can receive additional modules from the command and control server.
