 1. The attack begins with a malicious JavaScript exploiting a Chrome renderer vulnerability (likely CVE-2021-21224) to achieve remote code execution in the browser. 2. The JavaScript RCE exploit is used to execute a stager module that notifies the attacker of successful exploitation. The stager downloads an encrypted dropper module from a command and control server. 3. The dropper module contains exploits for two Windows kernel vulnerabilities - CVE-2021-31955 (info disclosure) and CVE-2021-31956 (EoP). 4. The EoP exploit abuses the kernel bugs to escape the browser sandbox and gain elevated system privileges. 5. Using the kernel exploits, the malware injects itself into the system process and executes a service module and remote shell module on the system. 6. The remote shell module provides the attacker with access to execute commands, upload/download files, etc. on the co
