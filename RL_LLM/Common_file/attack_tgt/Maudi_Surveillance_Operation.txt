1. The Maudi dropper creates a malicious library (e.g. msacm32.drv) and PoisonIvy shellcode blob (e.g. user.dat) on the infected system. 2. The dropper spawns explorer.exe to trigger the library to load via DLL hijacking. 3. The malicious library reads the PoisonIvy shellcode and executes it. 4. The PoisonIvy shellcode connects to the configured command and control server. 5. The attacker gains unauthorized remote access to the system.
