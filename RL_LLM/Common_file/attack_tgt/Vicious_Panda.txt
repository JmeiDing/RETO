 1. The attacker sends weaponized RTF documents containing exploits for Microsoft Word to targets. The documents have COVID-19 themes and are written in Mongolian. 2. When the document is opened, the exploit triggers and drops a DLL file named intel.wll into the Word startup folder. 3. The intel.wll DLL runs each time Word starts and reaches out to the attacker's server to download additional payloads. 4. The payloads include a downloader DLL that retrieves encrypted RAR files from the attacker's server. These contain additional modules. 5. A loader DLL decrypts and loads the RAT payload module from the RAR. 6. The RAT makes system calls and executes commands from the attacker's server through the loader DLL acting as an intermediary. 7. The RAT has capabilities for reconnaissance, remote execution, file operations, and more. It sends results back to the attacker's server.
