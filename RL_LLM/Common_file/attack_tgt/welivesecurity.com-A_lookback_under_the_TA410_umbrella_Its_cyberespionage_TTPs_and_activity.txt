1. Initial access through spearphishing emails with malware documents or exploiting public-facing applications. 2. First stage malware (Tendyron, X4) gains initial foothold. 3.

Second stage malware begins collecting data from system through keylogging, screenshots, microphone recording, etc. 6. Collected data is encrypted and stored locally in databases or caches. 7. C&C communication provides commands and exfiltrates data from second stage malware. 8. LookBack can proxy commands to first stage X4 malware. 9. FlowCloud rootkit hides malware processes and network traffic. 10. Malware leverages stolen credentials for lateral movement.
