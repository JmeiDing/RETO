1. The attacker sends a spear phishing email with a malicious Office document containing a macro as an attachment. 2. The macro executes when the document is opened, downloading the malware payload from a URL. 3. The payload drops both Kasidet backdoor and Dridex banking trojan onto the infected system. 4. Kasidet installs itself and establishes persistence on the system to survive reboots. 5. It uses anti-VM checks to avoid detection and steal data via memory scraping and browser hooking. 6. Browser hooking injects code into Firefox, Chrome, and IE to steal sensitive browser data. 7. Network communication with the C2 uses encrypted hardcoded headers and commands. 8. Meanwhile, Dridex also executes on the system to steal financial credentials and data. 9. Exfiltrated data from both Kasidet and Dridex is sent back to the attacker's command server.
