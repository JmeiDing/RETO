1. Gamaredon sends spearphishing emails with weaponized Office documents to targets. 2. The documents contain exploits to drop a .dot Office template file on the victim's system. 3. The .dot file executes a VBS script to maintain persistence and fetch the next stage payload. 4. The VBS script downloads a series of SFX archives containing batch scripts, VBScripts, and a .NET executable. 5. Macros in the VBScripts harvest system info to build unique URLs to retrieve further payloads. 6. The .NET module serves as the core backdoor to exfiltrate data from the compromised host. 7. The backdoor connects to Gamaredon's command and control servers to receive commands.
