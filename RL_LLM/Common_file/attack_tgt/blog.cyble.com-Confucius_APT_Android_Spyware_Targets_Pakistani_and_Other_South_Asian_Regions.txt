Here is the process of the Confucius APT attack described in the PDF: 1. The attack starts with a word document delivered to the target via email or other means. The document is crafted to encourage the user to open it. 2. When the user opens the document, it uses template injection to download an RTF exploit. 3. The RTF exploit contains a DLL embedded in an OLE object. 4. The embedded DLL (bing.dll) connects to a command and control server to download the malware payload. 5. The payload (update.exe) is saved and an LNK file is created in the startup folder to persist on system reboot. 6. The payload runs in the background performing spyware activities to exfiltrate data. 7. In parallel, the group uses social engineering tactics to distribute fake Android apps embedded with Hornbill and SunBird spyware strains. 8. Targets are lured into installing these apps from direct links instead of official app stores. 9. Once installed, the apps extract data like contacts, location, photos, WhatsApp messages, etc. and send it to command and control servers. 10. The exfiltrated data from compromised mobile devices and Windows systems is used by the hackers for espionage activities.
