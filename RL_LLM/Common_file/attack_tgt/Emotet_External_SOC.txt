1. The attacker sends a phishing email pretending to be an external SOC provider, with a malicious Word doc attached. 2. The victim opens the attachment, enabling macros, which triggers obfuscated code. 3. Payloads are decoded from the macros, launching PowerShell to download the Emotet malware executable. 4. Emotet is executed on the system, establishing persistence and command and control communication. 5. The malware gathers reconnaissance on the infected system like IP address, username, etc. 6. Reconnaissance data is exfiltrated back to the attacker's command server. 7. The attacker can send commands to further control the system, spread laterally, and steal data. 8. Credentials, cookies, and other sensitive data are extracted and exfiltrated from the compromised machine. 9. The persistent Emotet payload continues monitoring and data theft until removal. 10. Compromised websites are leveraged to host the malware, avoiding detection.
