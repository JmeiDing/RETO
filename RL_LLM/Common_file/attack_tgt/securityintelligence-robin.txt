1. Evil Corp threat actors create malicious .LNK files on USB devices. 2. A user inserts an infected USB device into a computer. 3. The user clicks on the malicious .LNK file on the USB device. 4. The .LNK file executes a command to download a Raspberry Robin loader DLL using living-off-the-land binaries like msiexec. 5. The downloaded Raspberry Robin loader DLL decrypts and executes an intermediate loader. 6. The intermediate loader detects hooks, decodes strings, and decrypts the final Raspberry Robin payload. 7. The final payload executes its unknown malicious activities. 8. In some cases, the Raspberry Robin payload installs FAKEUPDATES malware. 9. FAKEUPDATES can download Dridex malware or other tools used by Evil Corp. 10. Dridex steals credentials and enables further access for deployment of ransomware. 11. Evil Corp monetizes via data theft, ransomware, or compromised access. 12. Obfuscation and encryption of Raspberry Robin loaders evades security products.
