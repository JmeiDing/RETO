Trick users into executing malware or handing over credentials. 8. Collaborate with other teams to analyze exfiltrated data and plan further operations. 9. Cover tracks by using VPNs, falsified user agents, wiping logs, etc. 10. Continuously maintain access to compromised systems to enable future data theft or sabotage.
