1. Attackers send spear phishing emails with malicious documents to Olympics organizations. 2. The documents exploit a vulnerability to deliver a PowerShell implant stager. 3. The PowerShell implant profiles the system and sends basic system data to the attacker's server. 4. The attacker gains an initial foothold on the system. 5. Additional malware implants are delivered as second stage payloads: 6. Gold Dragon gathers more detailed system information and profiles. It establishes persistence. 7. Brave Prince, Ghost419, and RunningRat perform further reconnaissance, data gathering, and exfiltration. 8. The additional implants enable long-term access, data theft, and monitoring of victim networks. 9. The implants use anti-forensics and anti-analysis techniques to avoid detection. 10. Infrastructure analysis indicates the new implants are part of the same cyber espionage operation that targeted the Olympics.
