1. Attacker compromises an internet-facing enterprise server through some initial infection vector. 2. Attacker moves laterally within the network and installs a web shell on a web server. 3. The web shell allows the attacker remote access to the system but generates little traffic when inactive. 4. Defenders use network detection methods to try to identify the web shell: 5. Analyzing network traffic for anomalies in HTTP requests that could indicate a web shell. 6. Writing IDS signatures to match known web shell traffic patterns. 7. Tracking suspicious IP addresses that could be the attacker accessing the web shell. 8. Identifying the initial compromise that allowed the web shell installation.
