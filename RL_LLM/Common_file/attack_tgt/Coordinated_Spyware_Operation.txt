 1. Between January and October 2019, the human rights defenders (HRDs) were sent spearphishing emails containing malicious links. 2. If the recipient clicked on the malicious link, it would direct them to a file hosted on Firefox Send. 3. The file that would download posed as a PDF document, but was actually a Windows executable that contained obfuscation techniques to avoid detection. 4. When opened, the executable would install the NetWire commercial spyware on the target's device. 5. NetWire would then be able to monitor the target's actions and communications on their device. 6. The spyware communicated with command and control servers through the domain "researchplanet.zapto[.]org". 7. Some of the droppers used valid digital signatures from compromised UK companies to bypass security protections. 8. Large dummy files up to 300MB were also used to overload some security solutions. 9. In some cases, additional stages of downloaders were used before the final NetWire payload was installed and executed. 10. The attack compromised the target's computer and enabled surveillance of their activities, violating their right to privacy.
