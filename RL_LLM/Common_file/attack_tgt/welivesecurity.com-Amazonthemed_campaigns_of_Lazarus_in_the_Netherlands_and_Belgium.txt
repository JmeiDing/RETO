1. Spearphishing emails sent with job offer lures and document attachments. 2. Documents exploit vulnerabilities to execute initial malware droppers. 3. Droppers decrypt and load secondary payloads like BLINDINGCAN. 4. Secondary payloads communicate with C&C servers to receive commands. 5. Payloads establish persistence through scheduled tasks, services, etc. 6. Malware gathers data through keylogging, screenshots, credential stealing, etc. 7. Collected data encrypted and exfiltrated to C&C servers. 8. BLINDINGCAN used to execute commands, move laterally with credentials. 9. FudModule malware abuses driver vulnerability to disable security monitoring. 10. LookBack malware proxies C&C commands to other malware like X4. 11. Malware leverages credentials and access for further lateral movement.
