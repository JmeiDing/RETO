 1. The Disttrack dropper is executed on the victim system. 2. The dropper installs itself as a service called "MaintenaceSrv" to maintain persistence. 3. The dropper decrypts and extracts the communications and wiper modules from its resources. 4. The modules are saved with random file names like "netnbdrve.exe" or "_wiaca00a.exe". 5. The dropper starts the wiper module service to initiate the data wiping process. 6. The wiper module utilizes the RawDisk driver to overwrite the MBR, partitions, and files with random data. 7. After wiping, the wiper reboots the system to render it inoperable. 8. In parallel, the communications module attempts to connect to command and control servers. 9. The C2 can send commands to download additional malware or set a wipe date. 10. If the current date is past the configured wipe date, the wiper module activates. 11. The communications module writes to files like "mdmnis5tQ1.pnf" to coordinate actions with the wiper.
