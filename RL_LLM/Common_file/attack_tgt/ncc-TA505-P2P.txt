1. A downloader executable runs as a service and contacts a C2 server. 2. The C2 server provides encrypted components that the downloader decrypts. 3. Components include a signed driver, node tool, and configuration files. 4. The downloader installs the signed driver. 5. The driver filters system info, injects the node tool into a process, and reports back to the C2. 6. The node tool communicates with peers to exchange records containing metadata and payloads. 7. The records distribute updates and new capabilities within the P2P network.
