1. MuddyWater sends phishing emails with macro-enabled Office documents to victims. The documents use branding and logos of organizations the target would trust. 2. If the victim enables macros, a PowerShell script is dropped onto the system. 3. The PowerShell script executes and installs the POWERSTATS backdoor. 4. POWERSTATS connects back to C2 servers controlled by MuddyWater. 5. The attackers use the C2 channel to send commands and additional scripts to the backdoor for further reconnaissance and data exfiltration. 6. MuddyWater continually sets up new infrastructure and modifies their backdoor to avoid detection.
