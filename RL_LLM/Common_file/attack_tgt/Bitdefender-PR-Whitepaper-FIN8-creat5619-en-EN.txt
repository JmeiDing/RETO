1. Initial access is gained by FIN8 through phishing campaigns and other techniques. 2. A first stage PowerShell script is executed on the victim system. 3. It installs persistence using WMI and runs an encrypted .NET loader assembly. 4. The .NET loader decrypts and executes downloader shellcode. 5. The shellcode downloads the Sardonic backdoor binary from a command and control server. 6. Sardonic connects to C2 servers over port 443 using an encrypted custom binary protocol. 7. The C2 sends commands to gather system info, run shell commands, and execute malware plugins. 8. New plugins can be downloaded dynamically from the C2. 9. Data exfiltration and further staged malware deployment occurs. 10. FIN8 utilizes the backdoor to move laterally and complete their objectives.
