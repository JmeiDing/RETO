1. Delivery - Adversaries upload malware payloads to the content delivery networks (CDNs) of platforms like Discord and Slack. - Links to these hosted malware files are distributed via emails, chats, malicious sites etc. - Encrypted HTTPS hosting and compression obfuscation help bypass defenses. - Variety of file types seen including ISO, RAR, ZIP with PE32, JS droppers etc. inside. 2. Component Retrieval - Additional malware components/modules are hosted on the CDNs and retrieved as part of multi-stage infections. - Initial Word docs, droppers etc. download next payloads from the CDN. - Examples include Remcos RAT and AsyncRAT campaigns abusing this. 3. Command and Control - Features like Discord webhooks used for C2 communications between infected hosts and attacker servers. - Malware sends system info, data exfiltration, and receives commands via APIs. - RATs, ransomware, IoT bots like Qbot leverage Discord for C2. 4. Account Impersonation - Attackers steal Discord account tokens to impersonate users and remain anonymous. - Token stealer malware extracts tokens to gain access to accounts. - Compromised accounts used to upload payloads, social engineering, etc. 5. Ransomware Infections - Ransomware like Pay2Decrypt seen using Discord webhooks for status updates, registration, and C2. - Performs system encryption before displaying ransom payment demands.
