1. The threat actor distributes the malware using spear phishing emails containing either archive files (e.g. zip, rar) or Office documents exploiting the Follina vulnerability. 2. If an archive file is used, the victim extracts it, executing the malware inside (often an executable disguised as a document). If an Office document is used, opening it triggers the Follina exploit which executes the malware. 3. The malware generates a unique cookie to identify the infected machine and establishes encrypted C2 communications. 4. An initial "knock" request is made to the C2 server, containing the RSA-encrypted AES-CBC key. 5. The C2 responds with the submit URL path for sending further system info. 6. The malware sends an encrypted "submit" request containing extensive system info and details. 7. Periodic encrypted "ping" requests are made to the C2. Based on the response, commands may be executed. 8. The C2 can send back encrypted commands that are decrypted and executed by the malware, including uploading/downloading files, taking screenshots, injecting code, and more. 9. Embedded .NET DLLs allow execution of .NET code and PowerShell commands/scripts from the C2. 10. After spawning its threads, the malware uses process hollowing to delete itself from disk. 11. Communications with the C2 continue enabling the threat actor to control the compromised machine.
