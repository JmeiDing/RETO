1. The initial attack starts with a spear phishing email containing a malicious Word document. 2. When the user opens the document, it fetches a malicious macro template that uses VBA code stomping to evade detection. 3. The macro decrypts and executes obfuscated JavaScript code. 4. The JavaScript decrypts and drops a loader executable and configures a scheduled task to persistently execute it. 5. The loader executes an encrypted payload and maps it into memory. 6. The payload contains a backdoor that decrypts its configuration data. 7. The backdoor builds an encrypted data string to exfiltrate system information. 8. It communicates with C2 servers to receive additional modules or take a system snapshot. 9. The backdoor uses techniques like custom headers, encryption and Heaven's Gate to evade detection. 10. The C2 communication contains encrypted data that can be decrypted using a provided algorithm.
