 1. Attackers send specially crafted HTTP POST requests to vulnerable Exchange servers targeting valid static resource files that do not require authentication. 2. The POST requests contain XML SOAP payloads that use specially crafted cookies to bypass authentication and execute the payload, allowing the attacker to access mailboxes. 3. For remote code execution, the attackers leverage the Exchange PowerShell cmdlet Set-OabVirtualDirectory with a malicious ExternalURL parameter to install web shells. 4. The web shells are then used to dump credentials, move laterally, and further backdoor systems. Various tools like Mimikatz, ProcDump, PsExec, and others are used for post-exploitation activities.
