 1. Spearphishing emails are sent to targets containing malware payloads disguised as attachments. These use social engineering tactics like impersonation and topics of interest to the target. 2. If the attachment is opened, the malware payload is executed. This installs a remote access trojan like Infy or Ghambar on the system. 3. The malware establishes command and control communication to report to its operators. It exfiltrates data like keystrokes and screenshots. 4. The operators interact with the compromised system to further access accounts, distribute additional payloads, and pivot to new targets. 5. Cleaver/Ghambar can also receive commands to perform tasks like taking screenshots, executing shell commands, downloading files, etc. 6. Rocket Kitten brute forces Telegram accounts after collecting phone numbers associated with them. 7. The groups monitor public disclosure and evolve their tactics in response, maintaining persistent access to targets.
