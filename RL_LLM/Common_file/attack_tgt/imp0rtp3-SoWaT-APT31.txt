1. SoWaT is installed on a target router, likely with a custom "swt" component to manipulate the firewall. 2. The implant connects to a C2 server over TLS using encryption and a verified certificate. 3. SoWaT receives commands from the C2 server to perform actions like running a RAT or setting up a proxy. 4. For proxy connections, SoWaT goes through a complex initiation process with the attacker involving multiple stages. 5. SoWaT can proxy traffic between the attacker and victims or between multiple attackers. 6. The implant can exfiltrate data, run commands, and maintain persistence on the compromised router. 7. SoWaT relies on the encrypted "conf" file and "swt" executable to function. 8. If directed, SoWaT will remove artifacts and shut down listening ports when uninstalling.
