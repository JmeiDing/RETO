1. The attackers injected malicious JavaScript code into a third-party JavaScript library used by the hotel booking websites. This library was provided by Roomleader. 2. The injected code checks if it is running on the booking page. If so, it loads a credit card skimming script from a remote URL. 3. The skimming script is served only to mobile browsers, not desktop. 4. The skimmer captures users' personal and payment data entered on the booking page. 5. The skimmer encrypts the stolen data and sends it to a remote server controlled by the attackers. 6. The skimmer also replaces the original credit card payment form with a fake one to capture full card details.
