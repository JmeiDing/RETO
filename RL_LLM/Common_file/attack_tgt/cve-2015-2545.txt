1. The attacker sends a spear-phishing email with a malicious Office document attachment (DOC, DOCX file) to the target. 2. The document attachment contains an embedded EPS file that exploits the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability in Microsoft Office. 3. When the target opens the document, the EPS file triggers the vulnerability through malformed PostScript commands. 4. This allows the EPS file to execute its shellcode payload. 5. The shellcode decrypts and drops a malware executable on the system. 6. The malware connects to a command and control server to receive commands and exfiltrate data. 7. The malware can perform various actions on the infected system, such as providing remote access, capturing screenshots, and stealing credentials. 8. The attacker leverages the malware access to further penetrate the target's network.
