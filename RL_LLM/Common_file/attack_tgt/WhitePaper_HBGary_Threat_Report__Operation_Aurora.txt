 1. The attack starts with a JavaScript exploit targeting IE 6 to gain initial access. The JavaScript contains obfuscated shellcode. 2. The shellcode downloads an encrypted dropper executable from a remote server. 3. The dropper decrypts itself, drops the payload DLL to the Windows system directory, installs the payload as a service, and then deletes itself. 4. The payload DLL connects to a command and control server using a custom encryption scheme on port 443. 5. Operators send commands to the malware via the command server to carry out actions like stealing files or running additional commands. 6. The malware sends the results of commands back to the command server.
