 1. Wslink is installed on the victim's system and registered as a service. The initial compromise vector is unknown. 2. Wslink listens on a specified port for incoming connections. 3. A command and control server connects to the port and performs an RSA handshake to exchange encryption keys. 4. The server sends an encrypted malware module along with a signature and decryption key. 5. Wslink decrypts the module and loads it directly into memory using a library. 6. Wslink executes the module's export function, allowing it to reuse Wslink's communication functions.
