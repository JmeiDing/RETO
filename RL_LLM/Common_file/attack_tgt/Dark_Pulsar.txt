 1. The attacker gains initial access to the target network, possibly via exploits in the FuzzBunch framework. 2. The DarkPulsar implant is installed and loaded by lsass.exe via a hijacked security provider interface export. This achieves stealthy persistence. 3. DarkPulsar hooks authentication functions in lsass.exe to hide malicious traffic inside legitimate protocols. 4. The attacker sends DarkPulsar commands over SMB or other protocols to disable security features and extract data. 5. The EDFStagedUpload command deploys a more advanced PeddleCheap implant for extended control and exfiltration. 6. PeddleCheap payload connects to the DanderSpritz framework to enable running plugins for actions like command execution, file transfers, and credential theft. 7. Throughout the attack, DarkPulsar allows stealthy control and hides traffic, while stages deploy more capable implants for long-term compromise.
