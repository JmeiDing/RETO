1. The attacker compromises websites of interest to their target sectors or sends phishing emails with links to compromised sites hosting ScanBox. 2. When victims visit the compromised sites, the ScanBox JavaScript code executes in their browser without needing malware. 3. ScanBox gathers reconnaissance on the victim's machine by fingerprinting software installed, drives, OS version, time zone, etc. 4. ScanBox logs keystrokes of the victim while they are on the site, capturing any information they enter like credentials. 5. The keystroke logs and reconnaissance data are exfiltrated back to the attacker's server. 6. The attacker analyzes the logs to learn about their target's environment, software, credentials etc. and tailors further attacks. 7. Based on the reconnaissance, the attacker may compromise additional sites relevant to the victim and repeat the process to infect them with malware, or engage in further phishing attacks.
