1. The attack starts with phishing emails containing weaponized Microsoft Word documents that have links to download a malicious macro-enabled template file. 2. When the document is opened, it uses remote template injection to retrieve the DOTM file containing macros. 3. The macro executes and maintains persistence by replacing the victim's normal Word template file. 4. The malicious macro reaches out to download next-stage payloads from C2 servers. 5. These payloads likely deploy malware like CharmPower to achieve remote access, exfiltrate data, and carry out other objectives.
