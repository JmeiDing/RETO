 1. Spearphishing emails are sent to targets containing links or attachments to download the malware. 2. The first stage malware (downloader) is executed by the victim. 3. The downloader fetches and installs the full Machete malware suite. 4. Machete components are scheduled to persist on the system and collect data. 5. Data like documents, keystrokes, and screenshots are encrypted and exfiltrated to the attacker's server. 6. The attacker can remotely update Machete's configuration and binaries on compromised hosts. 7. Machete spreads laterally in the network by copying itself to inserted drives. 8. Collected data is used in new spearphishing emails to propagate the attack. 9. If FTP communication fails, Machete falls back to HTTP for exfiltration. 10. Physical exfiltration is possible if the attacker gains physical access to insert a drive.
