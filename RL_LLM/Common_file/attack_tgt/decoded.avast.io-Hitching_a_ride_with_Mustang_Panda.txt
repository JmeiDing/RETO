 1. Initial Compromise: Mustang Panda compromises an initial target, likely via phishing or exploits, to gain an initial foothold. 2. Establish Persistence: The group installs modular RAT tools on the victim using techniques like side-loading to hide in plain sight. 3. Internal Recon: The implanted RAT tools are used to explore the internal network and find sensitive data. 4. Exfiltrate Data: Large amounts of documents, emails, recordings, etc. are located and exfiltrated via the RATs to the distribution FTP server. 5. Consolidate Data: The exfiltrated data is aggregated on the FTP server before being moved to another unknown location. 6. Expand Access: The RAT tools have spreading capabilities that are used to move laterally and compromise additional systems and accounts. 7. Repeat Data Exfiltration: Steps 3-5 are repeated to continually collect new data from victims over time. 8. Obfuscate Infrastructure: The RATs use TLS and client authentication certificates to blend in with legitimate traffic to their C2 servers. 9. Manage Operations: The modular RAT tools are remotely updated over time to adjust capabilities based on the operation's needs. 10. Maintain Persistence: New versions of the RAT tools are deployed over time to infected hosts to ensure the group maintains access.
