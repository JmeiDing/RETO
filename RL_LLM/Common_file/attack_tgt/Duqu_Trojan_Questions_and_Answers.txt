1. Initial Infection - The initial infection vector for Duqu is unknown. Duqu does not self-propagate and requires an installer or dropper. 2. Install Drivers - The dropper installs a signed kernel driver that handles loading and decryption of DLLs. Drivers pretend to be legitimate files from companies like JMicron. 3. Load Encrypted DLLs - The driver decrypts and loads encrypted DLLs implementing the Duqu RAT payload. DLLs use a .PNF extension to masquerade as setup files. 4. Establish Command and Control - Duqu connects to C2 servers over HTTP, HTTPS, and a custom protocol on port 443. It resolves domains like kasperskychk.dyndns.org. 5. Exfiltrate Data - The RAT exfiltrates data from the infected system back to the C2 server. An additional keylogger module logs keystrokes and system info. 6. Download Additional Modules - Duqu can download and execute additional modules from the C2 server. 7. Maintain Persistence - The kernel drivers use rootkit techniques to hide files and maintain persistence on the infected host. 8. Receive Updates - Duqu can receive updates with new capabilities from the C2 server.
