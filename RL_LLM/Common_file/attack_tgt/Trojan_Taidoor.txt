 1. Crafted spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments are sent to targets. The emails are customized with content relevant to the target's interests. 2. The attachments exploit vulnerabilities in programs like Adobe Reader or Microsoft Office when opened by the target. 3. The exploit triggers decryption and execution of the Taidoor dropper component embedded in the document. 4. The dropper installs and executes the Taidoor backdoor payload on the system. 5. The backdoor communicates with command and control servers to receive commands from attackers. It can download additional malware or tools. 6. Attackers interactively explore compromised systems looking for valuable data or opportunities to move laterally in the network.
