 1. The Equation Group attackers select potential targets and infect them with the DOUBLEFANTASY validator malware. 2. DOUBLEFANTASY profiles the target system and sends back data to determine if the victim is of interest. 3. If the target is deemed interesting, the attackers upgrade the malware to the full EQUATIONDRUG platform. 4. EQUATIONDRUG components like drivers and plugins deploy onto the infected system for persistence, monitoring, data collection etc. 5. Plugins gather data like keystrokes, browser history, network traffic, screenshots based on the surveillance needs. 6. The collected data is encrypted and stored in the malware's virtual file system or registry storage. 7. The command and control communication plugins exfiltrate the stolen data to the attacker's servers. 8. The Equation operators analyze the received intelligence and send back additional malware modules or plugins tailored to the target. 9. Further custom plugins deploy to expand control and monitoring by utilizing EQUATIONDRUG's modular architecture. 10. If needed, the HDD firmware itself can be reprogrammed for the ultimate persistence on interesting high-value targets. 11. The modular platform allows continuous custom surveillance on specific targets by the attackers.
