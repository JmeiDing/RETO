1. The attacker sends a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment to the victim. 2. When opened, the attachment drops the IHEATE malware onto the victim's system. 3. IHEATE collects system information like computer name, username, IP address, OS version. 4. IHEATE sends the collected information to the attacker's command and control (C&C) server. 5. The attacker can send commands to IHEATE on the victim's system to further control and exploit it. 6. IHEATE uses encryption techniques to communicate with the C&C server. 7. The attacker leverages IHEATE's capabilities for long-term persistent access to the victim's network.
