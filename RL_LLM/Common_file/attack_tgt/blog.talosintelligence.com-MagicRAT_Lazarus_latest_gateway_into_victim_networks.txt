1. Lazarus Group exploits vulnerabilities in publicly exposed VMware Horizon servers to gain initial access to target networks. 2. Once inside the network, Lazarus deploys the new MagicRAT malware on compromised machines. 3. MagicRAT achieves persistence using scheduled tasks and contacts C2 servers controlled by Lazarus operators. 4. MagicRAT performs reconnaissance on the infected system to fingerprint the environment. It executes commands like whoami, systeminfo, and ipconfig /all. 5. The operator uses MagicRAT's remote shell capability to run arbitrary commands on the compromised endpoint. 6. The operator can also use MagicRAT to rename, move, and delete files on the infected machine. 7. In some cases, the operator removes MagicRAT and deploys other Lazarus malware like VSingle on the compromised host. 8. The operator can also use MagicRAT's C2 infrastructure to deliver additional payloads like a port scanner and updated TigerRAT malware.
