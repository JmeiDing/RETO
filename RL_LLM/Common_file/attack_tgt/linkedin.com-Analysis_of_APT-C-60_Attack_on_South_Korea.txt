1. Spear-phishing emails with malicious LNK files were sent to targets in two waves - in early February 2022 to politicians related to the Pyeongchang Peace Forum, and in mid-June 2022 to Dr. Bernhard Seliger. 2. The LNK file executes a JavaScript that reaches out to the attacker's server to download the next stage payload. 3. The downloaded payload (mssysmon.db) acquires system info and sends it to the C&C server. It also traverses directories and loads the next stage module. 4. The final payload (TaskControler.dll) contains the full RAT capabilities. It connects to C&C, exfiltrates files, takes screenshots, executes commands, etc. 5. The RAT payload uses encryption and other tactics to communicate with the C&C server and carry out its functions. 6. ThreatBook analysis identifies associated IOCs like IP addresses, domain names, and file hashes tied to this attack.
