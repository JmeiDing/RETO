1. Send phishing emails with decoy documents on current news events to gain initial access. 2. Use downloader executable to retrieve signed vulnerable app, malicious loader DLL, and encrypted Korplug payload. 3. Launch vulnerable app to exploit DLL hijacking and load malicious DLL. 4. Malicious loader DLL decrypts and executes Korplug payload in memory. 5. Korplug payload communicates with C&C servers using encrypted custom TCP-based protocol. 6. Korplug can perform reconnaissance, file operations, process creation, command execution, and data exfiltration on compromised systems. 7. Korplug persists via Run registry keys or scheduled tasks. 8. Korplug aims to operate stealthily using encryption, obfuscation, anti-analysis, and indicator removal.
