 1. Andromeda malware spreads via infected USB drives. One such USB was inserted into a Ukrainian organization in December 2021. 2. The Andromeda sample installed on the Ukrainian system beaconed out to command and control domains that had expired or been sinkholed. 3. In January 2022, Turla re-registered one of the expired Andromeda C2 domains. 4. After months of monitoring, in September 2022, Turla used the re-registered domain to deliver the Kopiluwak reconnaissance tool to the compromised Ukrainian system. 5. Kopiluwak profiled the system's network connections, processes, disks, etc. and sent the data to its C2 server. 6. Two days later, Turla delivered the Quietcanary backdoor to the same system. 7. Quietcanary was used to collect and compress documents from the victim's machine. 8. The documents were exfiltrated from the victim system back to Turla's servers.
