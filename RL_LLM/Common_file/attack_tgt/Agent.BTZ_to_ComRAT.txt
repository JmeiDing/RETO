 1. The attacker compromises a system and installs the Agent.BTZ or ComRAT RAT. 2. The RAT collects system information and data from the compromised host. 3. The attacker remotely controls the RAT to further interact with the system. 4. The RAT is used to execute commands, upload/download files, and hijack communications. 5. The attacker leverages the RAT access to infiltrate further into the network. 6. Eventually, the RAT installation provides long-term backdoor access to the threat actor.
