Based on the information provided in the PDF, the attack process used by CryWiper can be summarized in the following stages: 1. CryWiper malware is executed on the victim's system, likely via an initial compromise vector like phishing. 2. CryWiper creates scheduled tasks to repeatedly execute itself every 5 minutes. 3. CryWiper contacts a command and control server which can remotely trigger the data wiping process. 4. CryWiper stops critical services related to databases, email servers, and Active Directory. 5. Shadow copies are deleted to prevent easy restoration of files. 6. The Windows registry is modified to block RDP connections. 7. CryWiper corrupts files on the system using an algorithm called Mersenne Twister while avoiding critical directories. 8. A fake ransom note is generated demanding Bitcoin payment in exchange for decryption, even though recovery of files is not possible. 9. The wiping process is repeated via the scheduled tasks, destroying data on the compromised system. 10. The attack results in permanent data loss and disruption for the victim organization.
