1. The attackers infect the UEFI firmware of Gigabyte or ASUS motherboards using the H81 chipset, by modifying the CSMCORE DXE driver. 2. During system boot, the infected firmware executes a chain of hooks to propagate code execution: - Sets a hook in the boot manager to modify the kernel loader. - Modifies the OS loader to set a hook in the Windows kernel. - The kernel hook deploys shellcode and contacts the C2. 3. The shellcode sets up a thread notify routine to run a callback in a high-privilege winlogon.exe thread. 4. The callback sleeps for 10 minutes then checks internet connectivity. 5. It sends crafted UDP/TCP packets to the C2 server update.bokts[.]com to retrieve the final payload shellcode. 6. The shellcode may deploy a PE executable payload that runs commands to create a new user account and add it to administrators. 7. An older variant used the C2 domain erda158[.]to and hijacked threads from exe instead of winlogon.exe.
