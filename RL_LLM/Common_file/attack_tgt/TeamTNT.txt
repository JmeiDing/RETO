1. TeamTNT attackers deploy docker images containing cryptocurrency miners and propagation scripts. 2. Initial infection vectors include exposed Docker APIs and Kubernetes Weave Scope dashboards. 3. Images contain scripts that scan and compromise other exposed Docker APIs to spread. 4. For Kubernetes, the scripts gain root access via Weave Scope's unauthenticated shell access. 5. The image downloads and executes cryptocurrency miners from a remote server. 6. It kills competing malware containers running on compromised hosts. 7. Attackers use a tracking site to monitor infected hosts and statistics. 8. Infrastructure suggests the group originates from Germany. 9. Propagation scripts scan ranges for exposed management services and leverage them to spread. 10. Exposed Docker APIs and dashboards like Weave Scope carry high risk of exploitation. 11. Hardening configurations, authentication, and monitoring is critical for prevention.
