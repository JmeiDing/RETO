1. Evil Eye compromises Uyghur-themed websites and embeds iframes loading the IRONSQUIRREL exploit framework. 2. The iframes identify visiting iOS devices by checking the User-Agent string. 3. If the User-Agent indicates iOS 12.3 - 12.3.2, the site returns a multi-stage JavaScript exploit chain. 4. The exploit chain leverages a WebKit vulnerability patched in iOS 12.4. 5. If exploitation is successful, the JavaScript drops the INSOMNIA implant binary. 6. INSOMNIA executes on the device with root privileges. 7. The implant contains hard-coded IP addresses and HTTPS certificates for command and control. 8. INSOMNIA exfiltrates data from built-in apps and targeted apps like Signal and ProtonMail. 9. The data is sent unencrypted over HTTPS to the command and control servers. 10. The attacker-controlled sites enable continuous distribution of the exploit chain to visiting iOS devices.
