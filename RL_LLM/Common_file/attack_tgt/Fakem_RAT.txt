1. Attackers distribute FAKEM via spear-phishing emails containing malicious Office document or .exe file attachments. 2. The attachments exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft software to install a FAKEM executable file. 3. FAKEM copies itself to the system folder and adds a registry key to persist on system reboot. 4. FAKEM connects to a command and control server, sending system info. 5. The C&C server sends encrypted commands that are decrypted by FAKEM. 6. Commands allow the attacker to remotely control the system, upload files, take screenshots, etc. 7. Network traffic between FAKEM and C&C is disguised as normal protocols like Messenger or HTML.
