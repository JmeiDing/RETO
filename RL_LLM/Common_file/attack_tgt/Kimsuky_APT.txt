1. The attack starts with a screensaver file (SCR extension) that is executed on the victim's system. 2. The screensaver file writes a DLL file to the %AppData%\Local\Temp folder. 3. The DLL file is copied to %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Defender and renamed to AutoUpdate.dll. 4. AutoUpdate.dll gains persistence by setting a RunOnce registry key to load on reboot. 5. AutoUpdate.dll injects into the explorer.exe process to avoid antivirus detection. Two DLLs are injected. 6. The injected DLLs contain decryption routines to decode strings for executing malicious actions. 7. Every 15 minutes, the malware sends encrypted C2 beacons containing system info to suzuki.datastore.pe.hu. 8. A legitimate document is dropped to the same folder as the screensaver to avoid suspicion. 9. A batch script is used to delete the initial artifacts after execution.
