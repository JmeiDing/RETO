1. VERMIN is delivered via weaponized Office documents that execute macros or scripts when opened. 2. The macros/scripts execute the main VERMIN payload, which collects system info and contacts the command and control server. 3. VERMIN can receive commands from the C2 to perform actions like keylogging, screenshot capture, downloading files, and running shell commands. 4. Exfiltrated data like keylogs and screenshots are encrypted and sent back to the C2 server.
