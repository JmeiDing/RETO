1. Threat actors gain access to the ShadowPad malware, either through purchase or other means. 2. The actors use the ShadowPad controller to build a customized malware sample with desired plugins and configurations. 3. The malware is delivered to victims through phishing campaigns, supply chain compromises, or by exploiting vulnerabilities. 4. The implanted malware establishes command and control communication and additional plugins can be uploaded dynamically. 5. The actors interact with the victim machine through the controller interface, using ShadowPad's capabilities like command execution, credential theft, file exfiltration, etc. 6. ShadowPad provides long-term persistent access to the victim environment for espionage and data theft. 7. The modular nature of ShadowPad allows the threat actors to update their samples and add new capabilities over time. 8. The shared tooling across multiple Chinese groups makes attribution more difficult.
