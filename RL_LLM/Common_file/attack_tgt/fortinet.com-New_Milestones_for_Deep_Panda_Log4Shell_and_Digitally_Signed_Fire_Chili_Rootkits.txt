1. Deep Panda exploits the Log4Shell vulnerability to compromise VMware Horizon servers. 2. A PowerShell command is executed to download and run a series of scripts. 3. The scripts download and execute the Milestone backdoor DLL. 4. Milestone backdoor copies itself and registers as a service to persist on the system. 5. The backdoor collects system information and exfiltrates it over C2 channels. 6. A dropper installs the Milestone backdoor, a loader, and the crtsys.sys rootkit driver. 7. The rootkit uses DKOM and filtering to hide artifacts like files, processes, registry keys, and network connections. 8. The rootkit is digitally signed with stolen certificates used by Winnti as well. 9. FortiGuard solutions detect and block the malware at multiple stages of infection.
