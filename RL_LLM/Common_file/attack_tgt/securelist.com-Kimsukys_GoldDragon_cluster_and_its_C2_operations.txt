1. Kimsuky sends spear phishing emails containing weaponized Office documents to targets. 2. The documents contain macros that connect to a first-stage command and control (C2) server. 3. The C2 verifies the victim IP and email address before delivering a next-stage malicious document. 4. The document's macro fetches additional payloads from other C2 servers. 5. Initial payloads are scripts that fingerprint the victim system and download backdoors. 6. Scripts register the backdoors as scheduled tasks for persistence and send system info to the C2. 7. The backdoors like keyloggers and RATs steal data and receive commands from the C2 servers. 8. Stolen data like credentials and files are packaged and exfiltrated via the C2 channels. 9. Kimsuky continuously registers new lookalike domains and updates malware to avoid detection. 10. Infrastructure tricks like dedicated redirects and user-agent checks evade analysis and sandboxes. 11. Ongoing phishing campaigns deploy new malware versions to maintain access to compromised entities.
