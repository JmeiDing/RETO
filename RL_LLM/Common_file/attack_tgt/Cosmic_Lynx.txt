1. The target receives an email impersonating the company CEO requesting to coordinate payments to an external legal counsel for a fake acquisition. 2.

Secondary accounts in Hungary, Portugal, and Romania are provided if needed. 7. Cosmic Lynx exploits DMARC policies to spoof CEO email addresses for added authenticity when possible. 8. Social engineering themes adapt to current events like COVID-19 to build rapport and lower defenses. 9.
