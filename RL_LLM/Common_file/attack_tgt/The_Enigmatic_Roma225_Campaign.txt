 1. The attack starts with a phishing email containing a PowerPoint add-in (.ppa) file. 2. The .ppa file contains a macro that executes mshta.exe to download a payload from a blogspot site. 3. The blogspot page contains obfuscated VBScript that decodes and executes a RevengeRAT payload stored in the registry. 4. RevengeRAT contacts its command and control servers to exfiltrate system info. 5. The VBScript creates another script to download Document.exe from a remote server. 6. Document.exe extracts and executes the Outlook.exe payload. 7. Outlook.exe binds to a local port and carries out additional malicious actions.
