1. WinDealer is executed on the victim's computer, likely through a malicious email attachment or exploit. 2. WinDealer reads its configuration from files in C:\ProgramData. This contains info like C2 domains/IPs. 3. WinDealer establishes communication with the C2 server specified in the config or a random IP. It sends an encrypted AES key. 4. The C2 sends commands to WinDealer. These include commands to steal data, execute processes, write registry keys, etc. 5. WinDealer loads a DLL module from encoded data within itself. This module steals data like files, browser history, keyboard logs etc. 6. The stolen data is consolidated into .a files in %TEMP% folders. WinDealer monitors these files. 7. WinDealer encrypts the .a files containing stolen data and sends them to the C2 server. 8. The attacker can leverage the stolen data exfiltrated from the victim's computer for further exploitation, espionage etc. 9. WinDealer maintains persistence using registry modifications and continues stealing data as per C2 commands.
