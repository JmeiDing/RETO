1. Initial Compromise - Threat actors gain access, often via supply chain compromises. 2. Deploy Malware - Deploy ShadowPad dropper and encrypted payload files. 3. Install & Decrypt - Loader sideloaded by vulnerable executable, decrypts payload in memory. 4. Gather System Info - Payload fingerprints host and gathers recon data. 5. Establish C2 - Contacts C2 servers specified in configuration. 6. Lateral Movement - Leverages modules for further access. 7. Maintain Persistence - Configures persistence mechanism like service creation. 8. Execute Commands - Runs commands issued from C2 servers. 9. Exfiltrate Data - Gathers and sends data from victim back to attackers.
