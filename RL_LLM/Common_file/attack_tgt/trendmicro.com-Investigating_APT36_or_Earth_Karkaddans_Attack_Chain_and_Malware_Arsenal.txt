 1. The group sends spear-phishing emails containing malicious document attachments as lures, such as fake government documents or COVID-19 information. 2. If the victim enables macros, the document will download and decrypt an executable dropper hidden in the document. 3. The dropper executes and drops the RAT malware like Crimson RAT or ObliqueRAT. 4. The RAT malware communicates with the C2 server to receive commands and exfiltrate data from the compromised system. 5. Commands allow the malware to steal browser credentials, list drives/processes, take screenshots, and more. 6. For mobile attacks, the group has used Android RATs like CapraRAT distributed via malicious links. CapraRAT can record audio, access contacts, camera, location, etc. 7. CapraRAT also connects to a C2 server and has commands to drop additional payloads. It uses persistence to remain on compromised devices.
