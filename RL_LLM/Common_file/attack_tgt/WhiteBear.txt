 1. WhiteBear spearphished targets with malicious PDF files. 2. The PDFs dropped malware loaders signed with a fake code signing certificate. 3. The loaders injected the main WhiteBear malware module into processes like Explorer. 4. The module decrypted and loaded further components from resources using RSA+3DES+Bzip2 encryption. 5. Components included a transport library for C2 communication over hijacked satellites. 6. The malware could receive tasks for further discovery, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. 7. WhiteBear routed commands and data between infected machines using named pipes. 8. It used registry and file storage to maintain state across reboots. 9. The group shifted infrastructure and targets across subgroups over time.
