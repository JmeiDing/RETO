 1. The malware is distributed via phishing emails containing links or attachments. The lures are customized for the target (event invites, software updates, etc.). 2. If the attachment is opened or link clicked, the first stage malware (dropper) is installed on the system. 3. The dropper decrypts and executes the main CONFUCIUS malware payload. 4. CONFUCIUS queries posts on Yahoo Answers or Quora to extract keywords based on predefined markers. 5. It uses the keywords to construct or decode the IP address of the command and control server. 6. CONFUCIUS contacts the C2 server to receive commands and exfiltrate data from the compromised system. 7. The C2 server can send further commands to control the system, spread laterally, and collect sensitive documents and data. 8. Exfiltrated data may be compressed and encrypted before being sent to the attacker's remote server. 9. The process allows the malware to bypass blocking of known malicious domains by using legitimate websites.
