1. The attacker sends a spear-phishing email with the EnvyScout HTML attachment. 2. The victim opens the HTML attachment, which decrypts and drops an ISO file. 3. The ISO contains the BoomBox downloader which gathers system info and exfiltrates it to Dropbox. 4. BoomBox downloads and executes the NativeZone loader from Dropbox. 5. NativeZone loads and executes the VaporRage shellcode downloader. 6. VaporRage retrieves Cobalt Strike shellcode from a compromised site and executes it in memory. 7. The Cobalt Strike beacon establishes command and control and can download additional payloads. 8. Alternatively, NativeZone may directly contain the Cobalt Strike beacon shellcode. 9. The attacker leverages Cobalt Strike access to further infiltrate the network.
