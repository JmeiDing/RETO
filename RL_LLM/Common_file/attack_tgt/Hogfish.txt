1. The attacker sends a phishing email with a weaponized Word document to victims. 2. The document contains a malicious macro that executes on enablement. 3. The macro drops and decodes an embedded payload to extract the RedLeaves malware components. 4. RedLeaves leverages a signed anti-virus binary to load the implant payload into memory. 5. The implant establishes command and control communication to receive commands and exfiltrate data. 6. It uses RC4 encryption to communicate with hard-coded C2 domains and IP addresses. 7. The malware can harvest screenshots, credentials and system information and execute arbitrary commands. 8. It ensures persistence by adding a shortcut file to the startup folder to reload on boot. 9. The actor continually develops new versions of the implant with updated configurations for campaigns. 10. Infrastructure like domains and IP addresses are re-used across versions during the targeting of Japanese entities.
