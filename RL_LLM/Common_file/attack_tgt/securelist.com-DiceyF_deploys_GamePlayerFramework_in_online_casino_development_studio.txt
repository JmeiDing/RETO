1. DiceyF sends spear phishing emails with weaponized Office document attachments. 2. The documents contain code to download the initial GamePlayerFramework payload. 3. The initial downloader executes and fetches additional malware modules from the command and control server. 4. The main orchestrator module communicates with the C2 and manages the malware framework. 5. Plugins are retrieved from the C2 and provide remote access, surveillance, and data theft capabilities. 6. Plugins capture keystrokes, clipboard data, screenshots, credentials, and other information. 7. The orchestrator exfiltrates stolen data and module logs back to attacker controlled servers. 8. DiceyF operators interact with the compromised hosts using C2 commands and direct plugin control. 9. Over time, DiceyF updates the malware codebase, adds encryption and evasion techniques. 10. Additional payloads like PlugX can be deployed for interactive remote access alongside the framework. 11. Infrastructure like lookalike domains is set up to mimic legitimate software used by targets. 12. Persistence is maintained and new versions deployed to extend access to the victim networks.
