1. The attacker implants HTML code in a compromised Hong Kong website to exploit a browser vulnerability. 2. The code reaches out to download a multi-stage malware payload. 3. The initial Swisyn dropper detects the OS version and drops the appropriate decoder component. 4. The decoder uses DLL hijacking to load the PCClient RAT payload. 5. PCClient phones home to C2 servers and can execute commands sent by the attacker. 6. It collects system info and victim data which it encodes and exfiltrates. 7. The RAT provides remote access, command execution, lateral movement capabilities. 8. The malware ensures persistence by adding registry run keys to reload on reboot. 9. The attacker continually controls infected hosts using the C2 servers.
