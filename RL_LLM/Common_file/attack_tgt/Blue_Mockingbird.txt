1. The attacker exploits the CVE-2019-18935 deserialization vulnerability in a Telerik UI web application to gain initial access. 2. The attacker uploads malicious DLLs (XMRig miner and COR_PROFILER) to the compromised web server. 3. The web server process (w3wp.exe) loads the DLLs into memory, executing the miner and profiler payloads. 4. The miner establishes outgoing connections to external mining pools to begin mining Monero. 5. The attacker escalates privileges from the web server's low privileged account using JuicyPotato. 6. The profiler payload establishes persistence using COM hijacking by modifying environment variables and the registry. 7. The attacker moves laterally to distribute the miner payload to other systems using RDP and Windows admin shares. 8. The miner payload is executed on remote systems via techniques like service hijacking and scheduled tasks. 9. The attacker experiments with reverse shells and proxies for command and control. 10. The miner continues mining Monero on all compromised hosts, with persistence across reboots. 11. The mined Monero is transferred to the attacker's cryptocurrency wallet.
