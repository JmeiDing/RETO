1. The attacker distributes a malicious Microsoft Word document containing the Elise malware executable embedded as an OLE object. 2. When the document is opened, the embedded malware executable (a.b) is dropped and executed, exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. 3. The malware payload is moved to %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Caches\ as NavShExt.dll. 4. NavShExt.dll injects itself into iexplore.exe which was launched suspended. 5. The malware creates a mutex "donotbotherme" and file "thumbcache_1CD60.db" to store harvested data. 6. It proceeds to harvest system information and exfiltrate it to the hardcoded C2 server 103.236.150[.]14. 7. The malware can also download additional executables and DLLs from the C2 server and execute them on the infected system. 8. Persistence is achieved by setting a run key value "IAStorD" to ensure the malware runs at startup. 9. The malware attempts to query bogus domains likely to avoid detection and analysis. 10. Encrypted C2 communications use a static AES key contained in the malware.
