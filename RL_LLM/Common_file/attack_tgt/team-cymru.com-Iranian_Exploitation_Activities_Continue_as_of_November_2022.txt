1. Previous reporting identified IP address 107.173.231.114 used for command and control by Iranian group PHOSPHORUS. 2. Passive DNS showed domains associated with that IP getting re-registered recently. 3. An alert in September identified the IP and domains as IOCs. 4. Telemetry analysis revealed 107.173.231.114 communicating with a victim system in South Asia. 5. The victim system connected to IPs associated with Kaspersky and Cloudflare. 6. The connections mirror previous PHOSPHORUS malware behavior. 7. The South Asia victim traffic indicates use of hardcoded IPs for command and control. 8. Potential victims in Africa and Middle East showed similar connections. 9. The findings suggest ongoing Iranian exploitation using known IP infrastructure. 10. Monitoring of associated IPs and vulnerabilities can enable detection.
