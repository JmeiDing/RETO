1. Spear phishing emails are sent to victims containing macro documents or password-protected Excel files. 2. When enabled, the macros extract and execute malware binaries embedded in the document file. 3. The initial malware binary checks for analysis environments, terminates security processes, and drops a second stage binary. 4. The second stage malware collects system info, disables Windows Defender for the malware, and reaches out to a Dropbox URL. 5. The Dropbox URL provides a command and control domain which the malware contacts to exfiltrate the system info. 6. The malware sends further requests to the C2 server to receive commands, though no active response observed in analysis.
