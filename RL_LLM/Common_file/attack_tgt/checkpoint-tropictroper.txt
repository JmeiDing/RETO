Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF document: The document details research by Check Point on a malicious activity cluster tied to the Tropic Trooper group. The activity uses a new loader called Nimbda written in the Nim programming language that is bundled with a Chinese SMS bomber tool. Nimbda injects code into notepad.exe that reaches out to a GitHub/Gitee repo to fetch the next stage payload. This payload is an improved version of the TROJ_YAHOYAH malware that collects local WiFi SSID info in addition to other system info. The final payload is the TClient backdoor previously associated with Tropic Trooper. The malware uses a modified AES encryption algorithm that wastes analyst time trying to decrypt it. The campaign infrastructure uses hosting mainly in China. There are connections to Tropic Trooper based on similar TTPs like the loading process for the final payload DLL, the use of TClient, and similarities in C2 comms. In summary, this is research documenting a new activity cluster attributed to Tropic Trooper APT group featuring an unusual Nim loader, modified crypto, expanded capabilities in Yahoyah malware, and infrastructure hosted primarily in China. The targeting appears focused on Chinese-language users based on the SMS bomber lure. The malware authors show technical sophistication through the modified AES and additions like WiFi scanning in Yahoyah.
