1. Execute exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Office documents to download and execute a malicious MSI file. 2. The MSI file installs a backdoor (UserInstall.exe) that drops a benign Windows sidebar.exe, a malicious loader (wab32res.dll), and an encrypted config file. 3. UserInstall.exe uses BITSadmin to launch sidebar.exe. 4. The loader injects a DLL backdoor (TClient) into dllhost.exe using DLL hijacking. 5. TClient decrypts the config and connects to C2 servers over SSL. 6. TClient drops and installs the Turbo kernel module, then deletes it from disk. 7. Turbo hooks the system call table to hide processes specified by TClient. 8. TClient sends module requests like hide_pid() to control Turbo's process hiding.
