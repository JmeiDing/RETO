1. Sednit operators gain access to target systems through unknown means. 2. They deploy tools to dump the SPI flash memory containing the UEFI firmware. 3. The firmware image is modified to include the SecDxe driver module. 4. A vulnerability or misconfiguration in BIOS write protections is exploited to write the trojanized firmware back to the SPI flash memory. 5. At boot, the malicious SecDxe driver runs due to the compromised firmware. 6. SecDxe drops rpcnetp.exe and autoche.exe onto the Windows partition using its embedded NTFS driver. 7. It also modifies a registry key to run autoche instead of the legitimate autochk. 8. Autoche sets up persistence so rpcnetp.exe (the LoJax agent) launches at boot. 9. Rpcnetp.exe provides backdoor access, exfiltrates data, and downloads other modules as directed by the C2 server.
