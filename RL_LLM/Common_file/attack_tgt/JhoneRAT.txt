The image contains a base64-encoded AutoIT script which downloads another file from Google Drive. 5. This final file is the JhoneRAT Python malware, which is extracted and launched. 6. JhoneRAT checks the keyboard layout and only proceeds if it matches targeted Middle Eastern countries. 7. JhoneRAT establishes command and control via Twitter, Google Drive, ImgBB, and Google Forms. 8. The attacker can send commands and exfiltrate data from infected systems via the cloud services. 9. JhoneRAT maintains persistent access on the victim's machine.
