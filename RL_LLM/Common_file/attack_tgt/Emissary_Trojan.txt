1. The attacker sends a spear-phishing email with a malicious attachment to the target. 2. When the target opens the attachment, the Emissary malware is installed and executed. 3. Emissary establishes command and control communication, connecting to a domain or IP address provided in its configuration. 4. The malware sends reconnaissance information about the infected system back to the command server. 5. The attacker can send commands to perform additional actions, like uploading files, executing commands, or creating a remote shell. 6. Sensitive documents and data are exfiltrated from the target's system back to the attacker's server. 7. The malware can also download and execute additional payloads sent by the attacker. 8. To avoid detection, Emissary uses encrypted C2, encrypted configuration storage, and updates to evolve across versions. 9. The attacker maintains persistence on the infected system to continue long-term monitoring and data theft. 10. Compromised websites are leveraged to host malware and C2 infrastructure to avoid detection.
