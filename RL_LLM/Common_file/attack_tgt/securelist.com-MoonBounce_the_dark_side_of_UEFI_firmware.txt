1. APT41 remotely compromises the UEFI firmware image, modifying the DXE component with malicious code (infection method unclear). 2. On boot, the hooked DXE firmware intercepts boot services and propagates code to kernel space. 3. A malicious driver is loaded in the Windows kernel that injects malware into svchost.exe. 4. The user-mode malware reaches out to a command and control server to retrieve additional payloads. 5. Operators use the malware to move laterally and exfiltrate data from the network. 6. Additional malware like ScrambleCross, Microcin, and custom backdoors are deployed via the access. 7. Infrastructure links point to APT41, known for supply chain attacks and continuous tool evolution. 8. The rogue firmware gives APT41 stealthy persistence that survives OS reinstallation and hard drive replacement. 9. Over time, new phishing documents are used to deploy updated malware versions to compromised hosts. 10. The group maintains access long-term to steal intellectual property and sensitive data from the organization.
