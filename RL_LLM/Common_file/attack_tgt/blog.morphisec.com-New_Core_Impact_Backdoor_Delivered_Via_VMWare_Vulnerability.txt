1. The threat actor exploits the remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in VMware Workspace ONE Access. 2. The RCE exploit allows running malicious PowerShell commands as child processes of the legitimate Tomcat service. 3. A PowerShell stager is deployed that downloads the next stage PowerTrash loader. 4. The obfuscated PowerTrash loader reflectively loads and decompresses the final payload into memory without writing to disk. 5. The final payload is a Core Impact penetration testing framework backdoor configured with a C2 server. 6. The backdoor provides the threat actor access to initiate further malicious activities across the compromised network.
