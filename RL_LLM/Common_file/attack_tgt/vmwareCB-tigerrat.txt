1. TigerRAT is delivered via a custom loader that decrypts the payload stored inside the loader binary. 2. The decrypted payload establishes an encrypted C2 channel to communicate with the command server. 3. TigerRAT receives modules and commands from the C2 server to carry out functions like keylogging, file manipulation, and screenshot capturing. 4. Data collected from the victim machine is encrypted and exfiltrated back to the C2 server.
