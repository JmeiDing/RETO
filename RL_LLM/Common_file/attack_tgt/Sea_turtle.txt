1. Threat actors compromise the systems of a domain name registrar or DNS registry, gaining access to manage DNS records. 2. The actors change the name server (NS) records for a target domain to point to an actor-controlled name server. 3. The actor-controlled name server responds to DNS requests for that domain, sending back falsified A records that point to an actor-controlled IP address. 4. The actors set up actor-controlled servers at the falsified IP addresses to perform SSL certificate impersonation for the targeted domain. 5. Victim traffic that gets redirected is subjected to man-in-the-middle attacks, allowing the actors to harvest account credentials and sensitive information. 6. The actors maintain persistent access to compromised registrar/registry systems to continue manipulating DNS records. 7. The DNS record changes are temporary, lasting hours to days, before normal DNS settings are restored. 8. The actors continue to compromise new registrars/registries to hijack additional high-value domains.
