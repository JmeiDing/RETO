 1. The attack starts with a phishing email containing a malicious .docx file attachment. 2. Opening the .docx file triggers a template injection technique to download a malicious .dot file template containing macros. 3. The macros in the .dot file execute a VBScript. 4. The VBScript decrypts itself and downloads additional payloads from a C&C server. 5. The VBScript saves the payload as an exe file in a specific location if it meets a size threshold. 6. The VBScript executes the downloaded exe payload if it is large enough. 7. The VBScript deletes the temporary files it created. 8. The exe payload provides the malicious remote access, payload delivery, etc. that completes the attack chain.
