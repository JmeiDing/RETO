1. Identify unencrypted downstream satellite internet links and their IP ranges. 2. Set up a satellite dish, LNB, and DVB-S tuner card to receive the satellite broadcast. 3. Listen for packets sent to IPs in the identified satellite ranges. 4. When a packet (e.g. TCP SYN) is detected, spoof a reply (e.g. SYN ACK) back to the sender using a conventional internet connection. 5. The legitimate user ignores the packet since it's sent to an unopened port. 6. Communicate with the original sender IP while hiding behind the satellite IP range. 7. Set up C2 servers within hijacked satellite IP ranges to anonymize infrastructure. 8. Cycle between different satellite links regularly to avoid takedowns.
