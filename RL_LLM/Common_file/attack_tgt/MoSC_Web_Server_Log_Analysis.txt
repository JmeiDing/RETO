1. The attacker gains initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in a web server or web application. This is often through SQL injection or taking advantage of unpatched software. 2. The attacker uploads a web shell to the compromised web server. This allows them to remotely execute commands and scripts on the server. 3. The attacker uses the web shell to enumerate directories on the web server to find scripts and tools they can leverage. 4. The attacker escalates privileges on the web server, often by using SQL injection to execute system commands like "cmd.exe" or "xp_cmdshell". 5. The attacker pivots from the web server to attack other systems on the internal network. 6. The attacker establishes persistence mechanisms to maintain access like adding user accounts, modifying web pages, etc. 7. The attacker exfiltrates data from the victim network back to their own systems. 8. The attacker covers their tracks by modifying logs, deleting files, and other cleanup activities.
