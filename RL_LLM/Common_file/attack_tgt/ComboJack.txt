 1. The attack starts with a malspam email containing a PDF file. The PDF contains an embedded RTF file that exploits a Microsoft Office vulnerability. 2. When the victim opens the PDF, the exploit triggers and downloads an HTA file containing obfuscated PowerShell code. 3. The PowerShell code deobfuscates and executes, downloading the first stage of the ComboJack payload. 4. The first stage payload extracts and executes the second stage payload. 5. The second stage payload installs the final ComboJack malware. 6. ComboJack sets itself to run at startup and hides its files. 7. It starts monitoring the clipboard for cryptocurrency or digital wallet addresses. 8. When it detects a wallet address, it replaces it with the attacker's wallet address. 9. The victim unknowingly pastes the replaced address and sends funds to the attacker instead of the intended recipient. 10. ComboJack persists on the system and continues stealing any funds transferred this way.
