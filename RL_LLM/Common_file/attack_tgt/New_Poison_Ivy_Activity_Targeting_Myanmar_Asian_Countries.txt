1. Threat actors distribute weaponized documents, often related to targets' interests, containing exploits to infect systems. 2. The exploits execute and drop a decoy document, DLL, and Poison Ivy shellcode file on the system. 3. A legitimate Windows executable is copied and used to load the dropped DLL. 4. The loaded DLL decrypts the Poison Ivy configuration and connects to command and control servers. 5. Threat actors use the malware's remote access capabilities to further compromise the infected system and internal network.
