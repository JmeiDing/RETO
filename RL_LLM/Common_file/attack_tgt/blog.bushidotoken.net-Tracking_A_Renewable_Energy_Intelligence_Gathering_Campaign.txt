1. The attackers register domains mimicking legitimate organizations in the renewable energy and technology sectors. 2. Phishing emails are sent to employees at target organizations containing links to the fake login pages hosted on these domains. 3. Users who click on the links are directed to credential harvesting pages impersonating webmail, VPN portals, etc. 4. The phishing pages prompt the target to enter their email credentials which are captured by the phishing kit. 5. The attackers use the stolen credentials to gain access to employee email accounts at the target organizations. 6. Sensitive data and documents are exfiltrated from the compromised accounts for intelligence gathering purposes. 7. Compromised accounts may also be leveraged in further phishing attacks to target additional victims. 8. Additionally, the attackers compromise third-party websites, mainly in Brazil, to also host the phishing pages, enhancing the legitimacy of their attacks. 9. The campaign relies primarily on unsophisticated but effective credential phishing to gain the foothold needed for cyberespionage and data theft at renewable energy firms.
