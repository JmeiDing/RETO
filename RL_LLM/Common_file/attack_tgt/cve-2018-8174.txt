1. The attacker sends a malicious Office document with OLE object to the victim. 2. The OLE object links to a website hosting the IE VBScript 0-day exploit (CVE-2018-8174). 3. When the document is opened, the exploit triggers a UAF vulnerability in the VBScript engine. 4. The exploit executes shellcode that makes requests to download payload modules. 5. The shellcode decrypts and executes the payload - a Powershell script. 6. The Powershell script fetches additional modules and reflective loads a backdoor DLL. 7. The backdoor DLL hijacks trusted processes like cliconfg.exe using COM objects. 8. The backdoor connects to command and control servers to receive additional commands. 9. Further activities include exfiltrating data, installing plugins, maintaining persistence etc.
