1. FIN7 distributes USB devices containing malicious Arduino sketches to targets. 2. The sketch executes when the USB is plugged in, opening PowerShell. 3. PowerShell reaches out to a FIN7 server to download the IceBot RAT. 4. IceBot establishes command and control communication with FIN7 servers. 5. FIN7 operators use the IceBot panel to interact with compromised hosts, steal data, etc. 6. The attack avoids defenses by not transmitting malware over monitored network channels.
