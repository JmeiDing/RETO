1. ITG23 develops crypters like Dave, Lore, Mirror, etc. to encrypt malware payloads. 2. ITG23 sets up an automated Build Machine using Jenkins to compile stub executables with encrypted payloads. 3. ITG23 uses the crypters to encrypt payloads from their own malware like Trickbot, BazarLoader, Conti ransomware. 4. ITG23 also provides crypting services to other groups, encrypting payloads from Emotet, IcedID, Qakbot, MountLocker ransomware. 5. The stub executables with encrypted payloads are distributed through campaigns using phishing, malspam, etc. 6. A victim executes the crypted stub executable. 7. The stub executable decrypts and executes the embedded malware payload in memory. 8. The malware payload carries out its malicious activities, e.g. banking fraud, ransomware encryption. 9. Data exfiltration and C2 communication occurs via the malware payload. 10. ITG23 and other groups monetize the access and data, e.g. through bank account theft, ransom demands. 11. The crypting and obfuscation used evades detection by security products. 12. Automated rebuilding of stubs with varying payloads also evades protections relying on signatures.
