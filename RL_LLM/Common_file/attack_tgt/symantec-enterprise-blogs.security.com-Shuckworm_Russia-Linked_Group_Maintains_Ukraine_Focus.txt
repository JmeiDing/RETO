 1. The attack starts with the victim downloading a self-extracting 7-Zip file via their browser. This file was likely delivered through an email spoofing Ukraine's security service. 2. The 7-Zip file executes and downloads an XML file masquerading as an HTML application (HTA file). 3. The XML/HTA file executes a PowerShell stealer payload. Multiple versions of this stealer may be deployed to evade detection. 4. Other malicious scripts and tools are deployed, including Backdoor.Pterodo scripts, Giddome backdoors, and a 4896.exe backdoor capable of audio recording, screenshots, keylogging and downloading other malware. 5. Legitimate remote access tools like Ammyy Admin and AnyDesk are leveraged to maintain persistence and remote access. 6. A variety of command lines are executed to copy files, maintain persistence, and execute the various stages of the attack. 7. Network traffic goes to domains associated with previous Shuckworm campaigns, including a0698649.xsph[.]ru. 8. Exfiltrated data is sent back to the attacker's servers via the command and control infrastructure. 9. The attack persists through continuous monitoring, adaptation and reinfection of the victim's systems over time.
