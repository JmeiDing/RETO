 1. The threat actor sends phishing emails with links to zip files hosted on compromised sites. 2. The victim downloads and executes the zip file containing a CozyDuke dropper disguised as a self-extracting RAR archive. 3. The dropper extracts and executes the CozyDuke components along with an encrypted configuration file. 4. The CozyDuke main component DLL establishes command and control communication to receive tasks from the threat actor's server. 5. CozyDuke can load additional modules sent by the C2 server to extend its capabilities. 6. It can also drop other malware tools, scripts, and executables as instructed by the C2. 7. These additional executables implement their own C2 protocols to exfiltrate data from the compromised system. 8. CozyDuke sets up persistence mechanisms like registry run keys, services, and COM hijacking to maintain access. 9. Finally, sensitive data is exfiltrated from the victim's network back to the threat actor's infrastructure.
