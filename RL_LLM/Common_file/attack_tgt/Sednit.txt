1. Send targeted spearphishing emails with malicious attachments or links to the Sedkit exploit kit. These aim to infect the victim with malware like Seduploader. 2. Sedkit fingerprinting page profiles the victim's machine and delivers tailored exploits if they are a target. 3. Exploits install Seduploader or other first-stage malware onto the victim's machine. 4. Seduploader establishes a network connection to its C&C server, bypassing security measures. It profiles the machine and sends the report. 5. Based on the reconnaissance report, Seduploader may be instructed to download second-stage malware like Xagent or Sedreco. 6. Second-stage malware like Xagent facilitates remote access and espionage capabilities on interesting victims. 7. Alternatively, if the victim is not interesting, Seduploader may go dormant or the Sedkit landing page will redirect to a legitimate site. 8. Throughout the attack, 0-day exploits are leveraged as available to target previously unpatched vulnerabilities. 9. Persistence mechanisms are put in place like registry run keys, scheduled tasks, etc. to maintain access. 10. Sednit operators use pivoting tools like Xtunnel to move laterally within compromised networks.
