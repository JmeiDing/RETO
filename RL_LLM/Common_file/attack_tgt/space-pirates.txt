1. Initial Access - Uses phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to deliver malware 2. Execution - Malware families like MyKLoadClient, Zupdax, BH_A006 use droppers and shellcode to execute - Leverages collaboration apps like Discord and Slack - Abuses DLL side-loading techniques 3. Persistence - Creates registry run keys, services, scheduled tasks - Uses DLL hijacking for persistence (MruPidlList example) 4. Privilege Escalation - Implements various UAC bypass techniques - Exploits vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-0213 5. Defense Evasion - Obfuscates files, uses packers, encrypts payloads and configurations - Masquerades malware as legitimate files or components - Signs binaries with stolen certificates - Uses HTTPS and compression to bypass defenses 6. C2 Communication - Implements custom protocols over TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP(S) - Uses non-standard ports - Leverages Discord, Slack APIs for C2 - Exfiltrates data over C2 channels 7. Lateral Movement - Uses living-off-the-land tools like atexec.py and psexec.rb - Collects credentials through password dumping 8. Data Collection - Gathers documents, account/system info from compromised hosts
