1. ITG08 sends spear phishing emails with fake job advertisements to targeted employees. The emails contain malicious links or attachments. 2. If the user clicks the link or opens the attachment, the More_eggs malware is downloaded onto the victim's computer. 3. More_eggs establishes a reverse shell connection to the attacker's command and control server. 4. More_eggs collects system information from the infected device and sends it back to the attacker. 5. ITG08 uses Windows tools like WMI and PowerShell to move laterally within the victim's network. 6. The group escalates privileges using Mimikatz to harvest credentials. 7. ITG08 establishes persistence by installing More_eggs on other devices across the network. 8. In some cases, ITG08 also uses Metasploit and meterpreter reverse TCP stagers to gain full control of infected machines.
