 1. The attack starts with a malicious Word document called "Apply Form.docm" containing a macro. 2. The macro drops and executes a Visual Basic script called updater.vbs which pretends to be a Windows update. 3. The updater.vbs script executes two obfuscated PowerShell scripts - Script.ps1 and Temp.ps1. 4. Script.ps1 connects to the command-and-control server to receive encrypted commands. 5. Script.ps1 executes the commands using Temp.ps1. 6. Temp.ps1 decrypts and executes the commands, which include reconnaissance activities like user/process enumeration. 7. A full PowerShell script is sent for Active Directory and RDP enumeration to facilitate later lateral movement.
