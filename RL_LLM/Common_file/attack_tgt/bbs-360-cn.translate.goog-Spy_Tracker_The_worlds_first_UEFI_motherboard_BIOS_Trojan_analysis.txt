 The PDF describes the analysis of a new type of BIOS malware named Spy Shadow Trojan. This is the first known malware that can infect UEFI motherboards. The malware infects the BIOS boot module and hooks various system functions to load itself before the operating system starts. It uses techniques like thread callbacks to inject itself into system processes. The malware downloads additional payloads via the network and decrypts them. It creates a malicious account on the infected system for remote control. The malware shows sophistication in targeting the BIOS for persistence and having compatibility across Windows versions including 64-bit Win10.
