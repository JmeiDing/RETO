 1. Targets receive a spear-phishing email containing a compressed file attachment. 2. The attachment contains a .SCR file that when executed drops two files - a short pornographic video and a malware file disguised as Skype. 3. The malware makes contact with a command and control server to download updates and check if the system is already infected. 4. The malware is set to auto-run on reboot by adding itself to the registry. 5. It searches the hard disk for documents - .DOC, .XLS, .PPT, .TXT files. 6. It reports each file found to the C&C server which responds whether the file is "interesting" to steal or not. 7. "Interesting" files are compressed and uploaded to the C&C server. 8. At the end, it contacts the C&C again to see if it should continue running or stop.
