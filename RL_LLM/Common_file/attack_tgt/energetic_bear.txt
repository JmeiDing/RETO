1. The attackers send phishing emails with malicious documents to potential victim organizations. 2. If a user opens the document, it infects their system and provides an initial foothold into the target network. 3. The attackers install hacking tools like nmap, sqlmap, etc on the compromised systems. 4. They use the compromised hosts to scan the internal network and fingerprint other servers and resources. 5. The attackers find vulnerable web servers and infect them by injecting links that initiate SMB connections to steal usernames, passwords, etc. 6. They install web shells, modified SSH binaries, etc on the web servers to maintain persistence. 7. The compromised web servers are then used to host phishing sites, tools, and logs for the attacks. 8. The attackers use the web servers to scan and fingerprint external resources like websites, web applications, servers, etc. 9. Potential victims are identified and the cycle repeats - phishing emails are sent to these new targets, which then provides access to their networks/servers and so on. 10. Throughout the attack, the group uses the compromised infrastructure to collect data, passwords, and access privileges from victims that can enable further attacks on the main targets.
