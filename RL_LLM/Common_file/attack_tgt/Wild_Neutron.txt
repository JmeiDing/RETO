 1. The attackers inject a script into compromised websites that redirects visitors to another site hosting a Java zero-day exploit. 2. The exploitation site loads several resources like JavaScript files that eventually load a malicious SWF file. 3. The SWF file exploits the victim to install malware. 4. An initial dropper malware decrypts and executes the main backdoor Jripbot/Wild Neutron. 5. The backdoor gathers system info, generates an ID, and contacts the C&C server. 6. The C&C server sends commands to perform actions like executing commands, installing plugins, etc. 7. Additional tools are used for lateral movement, credentials harvesting, data exfiltration via SSH tunnels. 8. In 2015, the group used a stolen signed Acer certificate for the dropper to bypass security warnings. 9. The exploit kit redirects visitors to a site that loads Flash exploits in SWF files similarly to the Java attack.
