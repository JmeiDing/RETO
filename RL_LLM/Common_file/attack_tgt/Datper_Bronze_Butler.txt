Here are the key steps in the attack process described in the PDF document: 1. The threat actor compromises legitimate websites located in South Korea and Japan to use as command and control servers. 2. The actor deploys custom malware, including Datper, xxmm backdoor, and Emdivi, to victim machines. 3. The malware families contain mutexes and make requests to the command servers hosted on the compromised websites. 4. The command servers provide backdoor access, allow remote execution of commands, and can facilitate installation of additional malware. 5. The malware gathers system information from victims and exfiltrates data to the attacker. 6. The actor periodically changes the command and control infrastructure, compromising new websites over time. 7. However, infrastructure analysis reveals recurring IP addresses used across campaigns with different malware families. 8. In this way, the actor maintains persistent access to victim networks over multiple years.
