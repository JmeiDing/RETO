1. TrickBot malware infects a victim's computer, often via phishing emails or other delivery methods. 2. The malware uses a JavaScript downloader to communicate with the command and control (C2) server and fetch the web injections. 3. The downloader sends an HTTPS request to the C2 server using referrer policies to send fingerprint data. 4. The C2 server responds with a customized web injection targeting the bank site the victim is accessing. 5. The web injection is injected into the victim's browser and modifies the bank website traffic in transit using man-in-the-browser techniques. 6. The injected code tricks the victim into entering credentials or approving fraudulent transactions. It may also scrape additional fingerprint data. 7. The web injection code uses obfuscation, encoding, anti-debugging, and other evasive tactics to avoid detection and analysis. 8. The stolen banking credentials or fraudulent transactions allow the attackers to steal money from the victim's accounts. 9. TrickBot may also download additional modules like ransomware to further monetize its access to the infected computer. 10. The attacker receives the stolen data or money through the secure C2 communication channel.
