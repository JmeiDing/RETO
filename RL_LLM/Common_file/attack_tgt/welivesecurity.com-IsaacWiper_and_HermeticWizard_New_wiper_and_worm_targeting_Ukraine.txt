1. HermeticWiper drops legitimate EaseUS Partition Master drivers as kernel drivers to perform low-level disk operations. It disables Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) and wipes itself from disk. 2. HermeticWiper overwrites the master boot record (MBR), master file table (MFT), registry hives, and specific folders with random data using CryptGenRandom. 3. HermeticWiper recursively wipes files and folders on the system drive using an unusual technique similar to the Windows Wipe project. 4. HermeticWiper restarts the system, which fails to boot due to the corrupted MBR and MFT. 5. IsaacWiper enumerates physical drives and wipes the first 0x10000 bytes using the ISAAC PRNG seeded with GetTickCount. 6. IsaacWiper recursively enumerates logical drives and wipes all files with random bytes from the ISAAC PRNG. 7. An updated IsaacWiper version added debugging logs, indicating issues wiping some systems.
