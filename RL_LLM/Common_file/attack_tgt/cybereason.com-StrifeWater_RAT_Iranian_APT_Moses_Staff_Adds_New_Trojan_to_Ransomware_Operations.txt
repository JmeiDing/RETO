1. The attackers gain initial access to the target network through unknown means. 2. The StrifeWater RAT is deployed on compromised hosts as "calc.exe." 3. StrifeWater profiles the infected system and sends the info to its hardcoded C2 server. 4. The attackers use StrifeWater to execute commands, capture screenshots, and move laterally. 5. StrifeWater creates persistence via scheduled tasks. 6. The attackers use StrifeWater to conduct internal recon and gather data from the network. 7. After sufficient access is gained, the attackers deliver the PyDCrypt malware. 8. PyDCrypt spreads internally and deploys the ransomware payload called DCSrv. 9. Before deploying the ransomware, StrifeWater is removed and replaced with a normal Windows binary. 10. The ransomware encrypts files across the network, disrupting operations and masking the espionage activities. 11. Finally, the attackers exfiltrate any stolen data from the compromised environment.
