1. The attack starts with a phishing email containing a malicious .zip file as an attachment. The zip file contains an executable dropper. 2. When the victim opens and executes the dropper, it displays a Russian holiday-themed image as a decoy. In the background, it contacts a command and control server to download the next stage payload, which is a CAB file. 3. The dropper extracts the CAB file, which contains a batch script, Konni RAT executable, and configuration file. 4. The batch script waits for the CAB to decompress then executes the Konni RAT installer. 5. The installer moves the RAT files into System32 and registers the RAT as a Windows service to load at startup. 6. The Konni RAT gathers system info, browsing history, processes, and user details, archives the data, and encrypts it. 7. The RAT exfiltrates the encrypted data to the command and control server. It can also receive additional commands from the C2.
