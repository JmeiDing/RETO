1. Naikon sends phishing emails with weaponized Office document attachments exploiting vulnerabilities like RoyalRoad. 2. The documents drop a malicious loader executable onto the victim system. 3. The loader establishes persistence and gathers system info before downloading the Aria-body malware. 4. Aria-body provides remote access capabilities allowing the attacker to extract files, keylog, and take screenshots. 5. Naikon uses Aria-body to move laterally and compromise additional systems on the network. 6. The group exfiltrates stolen documents and data through encrypted C2 communications.
