 1. Spear phishing emails containing Word documents or zip files are sent to targets. The emails impersonate real organizations or contacts. 2. When documents are opened, embedded macros execute droppers which decrypt and install malware. 3. Droppers install remote access trojans (RATs) like CyberGate, XtremeRAT, or AlienSpy/Adwind. 4. RATs connect to command and control servers registered by Packrat to receive commands. 5. Commands like upload, download, and execute are carried out on the infected machines to steal data and spy on targets.
