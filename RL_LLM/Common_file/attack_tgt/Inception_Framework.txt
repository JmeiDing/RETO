1. Inception sends a reconnaissance document to fingerprint the target's system. 2. Days later, they send a second spearphishing email with an exploit document that retrieves and opens a remote RTF file. 3. The RTF file exploits a vulnerability and executes a loader DLL on the system. 4. The loader DLL decrypts and injects the main payload DLL into memory. 5. The payload gathers system info, executes plugins, and communicates with C2 servers on cloud storage providers via WebDAV. 6. Various plugins are used for surveillance, stealing files, credentials, browser data, etc. 7. Compromised routers and servers act as proxies to mask C2 traffic to the cloud servers. 8. Mobile malware is also used to infect Android, iOS, and Blackberry devices via SMS and links.
