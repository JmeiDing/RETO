The macros reach out to download an image file containing a PowerShell script hidden via steganography. 3. The PowerShell script installs Chocolatey and Python on the victim machine. 4. Another image with a Python backdoor script named Serpent is downloaded, also hidden via steganography. 5. Serpent connects to a command and control server on Tor. 6. The C2 server can send commands for Serpent to execute and return the results. 7. Serpent uses a proxy pastebin service to transfer command results back to the C2. 8. The threat actor can monitor the pastebin to see command outputs. 9. Serpent loops indefinitely to wait for and process additional commands.
