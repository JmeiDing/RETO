 1. The threat actor sends phishing emails containing links to malware droppers disguised as documents. 2. Victims download and execute the droppers which install the CrashOverride backdoor and components. 3. The backdoor connects to the threat actor's command and control server to receive instructions. 4. The command server sends tasks to run CrashOverride payload modules. 5. The launcher module loads ICS protocol modules like IEC-104 and OPC DA. 6. The protocol modules locate grid devices like RTUs and PLCs and manipulate them by sending unauthorized commands. 7. Manipulation of grid devices can de-energize lines, open breakers, or continually toggle breaker state. 8. Continual toggling can island substations, take them offline, and cause power outages. 9. CrashOverride can also leverage additional modules for denial of service attacks against protective relays and to wipe systems. 10. Finally, the wiper module disables systems, deletes files, and hampers restoration efforts.
