1. The attacker sends a downloader executable impersonating legitimate software, often in a zip file. 2. The executable runs an Inno Setup script that drops and executes a .NET C2 client. 3. The C2 client collects system information and communicates with the command server to retrieve the next payload. 4. The C2 downloads a PowerShell script that decodes and runs the Jupyter .NET infostealer module. 5. Jupyter steals browser data like cookies and passwords and copies it to avoid detection. 6. The exfiltrated data is sent back to the C2 server's admin panel for the attacker to collect. 7. Jupyter uses techniques like process hollowing and startup folder persistence for stealth and continuity. 8. The malware Authors constantly change tactics, protocols, and code to evade protections.
