1. The attackers send spear phishing emails with weaponized Office document attachments to targeted victims. 2. The document contains embedded executable code that extracts and saves two malicious files - updater.mod and glue30.dll. 3. The executable copies rundll32.exe, uses it to execute updater.mod, and establishes persistence. 4. updater.mod connects to command-and-control servers on cloud storage, downloads commands and additional modules. 5. It executes commands, collects data, and exfiltrates it back to the C2 servers. 6. glue30.dll performs keylogging by installing hooks and injecting into processes. 7. msvcrt58.sqt intercepts POP3 email traffic, steals credentials and mail content. 8. dfrgntfs5.sqt contains extensive surveillance capabilities executed via commands from the C2. 9. New versions of the malware are continuously developed and deployed to victims over the 8 years. 10. Collected data and stolen files are packaged and exfiltrated to the attacker's cloud storage accounts.
