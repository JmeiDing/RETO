1. The threat actor creates or alters an RTF file to include a "\*template" control word pointing to a malicious URL instead of a local template file. 2. The malicious RTF file is sent to the target via phishing email. 3. When the target opens the RTF file, Microsoft Word retrieves the content from the specified URL. 4. The content from the URL, which contains malware or other malicious code, gets retrieved and executed before the RTF file displays its lure content. 5. This results in the target system getting compromised via the malicious code retrieved from the remote URL in the RTF template injection technique.
