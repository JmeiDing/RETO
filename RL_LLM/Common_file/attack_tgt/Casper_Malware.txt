1. The threat actor hosted the Casper malware and Flash zero-day exploits on a Syrian government website. 2. Targets in Syria were redirected to the exploits, likely via links in emails or on compromised websites. 3. When victims visited the site, the exploits triggered and installed the Casper malware. 4. Casper's dropper component installed the main payload executable on the system with persistence mechanisms. 5. The dropper uninstalled itself to avoid detection. 6. On first run, the payload collected system information and sent it back to the C2 server. 7. The C2 server could then send additional commands to control the infected machine, execute additional programs, etc. 8. Casper took measures to remain hidden on the machine, evade antivirus detection, and disable certain behaviors depending on the AV product detected. 9. Code similarities indicate Casper was developed by the same group behind the Babar and Bunny malware based on analysis by researchers.
