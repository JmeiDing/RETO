1. The attacker sends a spear phishing email with a malicious Word document to the victim. 2. The document exploits CVE-2012-0158 to drop a decoy document and an executable payload. 3. The executable is a self-extracting RAR archive containing the NetTraveler malware modules. 4. The modules establish persistence by hijacking a Windows service to load the NetTraveler DLL. 5. NetTraveler contacts the C2 server to receive commands to collect data, download files, etc. 6. The C2 address is decrypted from another module rather than hardcoded. 7. NetTraveler executes commands from the attacker to carry out cyber espionage activities.
