1. Delivery - Ponmocup is distributed through compromised websites and socially engineered files. It previously used fake codec packs and Flash updates. Since 2011 it has used a method called Zuponcic that relies on a .htaccess redirect on compromised sites. 2. Installation - The installer component sets registry run keys to persistently execute the initiator component at startup. It uses undocumented Windows APIs to disable system restore points. 3. Loading - The initiator DLL starts the loader component in memory, which decrypts and executes the main module and plug-ins stored encrypted in the registry. 4. Command and Control - The main module connects to command and control servers to receive updates and new plug-in modules. The IP addresses are obfuscated through domain generation. Traffic is encrypted and tunneled through cookies. 5. Plug-ins - Ponmocup uses plug-in modules to execute specific capabilities like credential theft, network device scanning, and ad fraud. Plug-ins are distributed to subsets of infected machines. 6. Anti-Analysis - Ponmocup employs several techniques to detect and evade analysis, including blacklisting systems and delivering fake payloads.
