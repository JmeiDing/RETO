1. Goblin Panda sends a malicious RTF file to victims in Cambodia. 2. The RTF file exploits a vulnerability to install a legitimate file and a RAT malware on the victim's machine. 3. The RAT contacts a command and control server at weather.gbaycruise.com. 4. The C2 server has ties to infrastructure used in Goblin Panda's past attacks on Vietnam. 5. Goblin Panda uses similar exploit tools, malware, and infrastructure in the attacks on Cambodia and Vietnam. 6. There are links through domain registration patterns between the Cambodia/Vietnam attacks and infrastructure used by Chinese group Temp Periscope. 7. Another RTF file targeting Cambodia contacts IP address 103.243.175.181, associated with a domain used to attack Cambodian elections. 8. The tactics, tools, and infrastructure suggest Goblin Panda carried out the intrusion campaigns against Cambodia and South Korea using techniques also leveraged by Temp Periscope.
