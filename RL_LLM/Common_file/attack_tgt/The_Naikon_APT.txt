 1. Spearphishing emails with weaponized attachments are sent to targets. 2. When the attachment is opened, it installs a remote access trojan/backdoor. 3. The backdoor connects to a command and control server to receive configurations. 4. It downloads its main module from the C&C server and executes commands in memory without saving to disk. 5. The backdoor can exfiltrate files, install plugins, execute shell commands, etc. based on the 48 supported commands. 6. In some cases, proxy servers are used in-country to relay connections to the C&C server. 7. Separate operators focus on targets in specific countries. 8. Lateral movement tools like keyloggers are installed to collect credentials and sniff network traffic. 9. The attackers also register lookalike email addresses for spearphishing.
