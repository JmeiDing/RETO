1. The Lazarus Group breaches the networks of financial institutions and compromises the servers handling ATM transactions. 2. They install malware named Trojan.Fastcash on the compromised servers. 3. Trojan.Fastcash monitors incoming ISO 8583 financial transaction messages. 4. When it detects a fraudulent cash withdrawal request using an account number on the attackers' list, Trojan.Fastcash intercepts it. 5. Trojan.Fastcash then constructs a fake ISO 8583 response message approving the fraudulent withdrawal. 6. This fake response is sent back, allowing the criminals to withdraw cash from ATMs. 7. The hackers initiate fraudulent withdrawal requests using real bank accounts with minimal activity that they likely opened or stole. 8. The malware variants tailor the fake responses for each transaction processing network they have compromised.
