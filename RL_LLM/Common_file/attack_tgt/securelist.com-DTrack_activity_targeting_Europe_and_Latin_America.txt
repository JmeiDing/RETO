1. The threat actor spreads the DTrack malware executable through unspecified means. 2. DTrack unpacks its payload in multiple stages using encryption and obfuscation. 3. The first stage code retrieves the second stage shellcode from the executable. 4. The shellcode decrypts the third stage - another shellcode and the final payload. 5. The third stage shellcode locates the encryption key and decrypts the final payload DLL. 6. The DLL is loaded into explorer.exe using process hollowing. 7. DTrack contacts its C2 servers and can execute commands uploaded by the attacker. 8. The attacker uses DTrack to move laterally and compromise additional systems on the network.
