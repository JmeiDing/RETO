1. DeathStalker sends spear-phishing emails containing archives with malicious LNK files that appear to be document shortcuts. 2. Clicking the LNK file executes a series of stages: - Stage 0 extracts and executes the next stage and displays a decoy document. - Stage 1 connects to a dead drop resolver to get crypto material to decode stage 2. It also establishes persistence. - Stage 2 is the Powersing malware that connects to the C&C server and can take screenshots and execute scripts. 3. Upon system restart, a VBE startup script is executed that leads back to stage 2 Powersing. 4. Powersing connects to the C&C server to exchange JSON encoded objects and can capture screenshots and execute arbitrary Powershell scripts provided by the operators. 5. To find the real C&C server, Powersing first connects to public platforms like Pastebin that serve as "dead drop resolvers" to obtain an IP address encoded in a specific pattern. 6. The IP address is decoded by dividing an integer by a constant and converting it. This IP points to the real C&C server used to control infected machines. 7. Powersing, Janicab, and Evilnum all use similar techniques for infection, command and control, and appear targeted at the financial sector, suggesting they are operated by the same group - DeathStalker.
