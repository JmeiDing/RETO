Here is the extracted process of the attack from the PDF: 1. Initial infection via spear-phishing emails with COVID-19 themes and malicious Word docs containing macros. 2. Malicious macro downloads and executes ThreatNeedle malware which goes through multiple stages to install backdoor. 3. ThreatNeedle backdoor installed for remote access and control of infected hosts. 4. Attackers gather credentials using tools like Responder. 5. Lateral movement through network using acquired credentials and Windows commands. 6. Compromise router VM to bypass network segmentation between corporate and restricted segments. 7. Use compromised router as proxy server to allow exfiltration of data from isolated intranet. 8. Use custom tunneling tools to create covert channels for data exfiltration. 9. Exfiltrate stolen data to attacker controlled servers.
