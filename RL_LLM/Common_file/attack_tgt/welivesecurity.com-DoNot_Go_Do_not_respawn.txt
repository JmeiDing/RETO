1. Donot Team sends spearphishing emails with malicious Office document attachments, typically Word or PowerPoint files. 2. The documents contain exploits like CVE-2017-11882 or macros that execute a downloader file on the system. 3. The initial downloader runs a chain of other downloaders that retrieve the main malware components. 4. The backdoor malware contacts a command and control server to receive commands and additional modules. 5. Modules are used to collect files, capture screenshots, log keystrokes, and steal other data from the compromised system. 6. Collected data is staged in specific folders on the victim's computer. 7.
