 1. NOBELIUM sends phishing emails with links to targets. 2. The links go through the Constant Contact mailing service then redirect to NOBELIUM's infrastructure. 3. The infrastructure delivers a malicious ISO file to the target system. 4. The ISO file contains a shortcut that executes a hidden DLL implant. 5. The DLL executes Cobalt Strike Beacon to achieve persistence on the system. 6. Beacon connects to NOBELIUM's command and control servers to enable further exploitation.
