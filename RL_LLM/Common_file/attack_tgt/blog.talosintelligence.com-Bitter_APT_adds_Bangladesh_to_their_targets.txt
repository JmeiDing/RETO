1. Bitter sends spear-phishing emails containing a malicious Office document to targets in the Bangladesh government. 2. The emails contain thematic lures relevant to the target's work to entice opening. They originate from and spoof legitimate Pakistani government organizations. 3. If the target opens the attached RTF or Excel document, it exploits vulnerabilities CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0798, and CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Office. 4. The exploit launches the Equation Editor app to execute embedded OLE objects containing shellcode. 5. The shellcode connects to a remote server to download the Bitter trojan ZxxZ and executes it on the system. 6. ZxxZ gathers system information like hostname, OS, and username. It sends this to the C2 server helpdesk[.]autodefragapp[.]com. 7. The C2 instructs ZxxZ to download and execute additional files, allowing further activity on the compromised system. 8. Bitter can now leverage the remote access to steal data, deploy other tools, or pursue objectives.
