1. Initial Infection. Symbiote is deployed on the victim Linux system, likely through an initial intrusion vector like a vulnerability exploit or credential compromise. 2. Loading and Hiding. Symbiote uses LD_PRELOAD to inject itself into running processes. It hooks libc, libpcap, and other functions to hide its files, processes, and network activity. 3. Network Obfuscation. Symbiote injects BPF bytecode to filter malicious network connections. It exfiltrates data via DNS requests to domains impersonating Brazilian banks. 4. Credential Harvesting. Symbiote hooks the libc read function to capture credentials from ssh and scp. It stores and exfiltrates the credentials encrypted via RC4. 5. Maintaining Persistence. Symbiote hooks PAM functions to create a backdoor accessible with a hardcoded password. It can download and execute additional scripts for further control. 6. Covering Tracks. Symbiote is designed to hide evidence of intrusion and make detection very difficult. Even live analysis of an infected system may not uncover artifacts of the malware.
