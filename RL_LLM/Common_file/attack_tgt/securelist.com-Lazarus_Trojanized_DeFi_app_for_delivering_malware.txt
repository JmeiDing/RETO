1. The attacker sends a spear-phishing email or social media message to trick the victim into executing a trojanized DeFi wallet application installer. 2. The trojanized installer runs and drops a backdoor executable in ProgramData/Microsoft/GoogleChrome.exe. It also extracts a legitimate DeFi wallet app executable into ProgramData/Microsoft. 3. The installer launches the dropped backdoor, passing the path of the legitimate DeFi app executable as a command line argument. 4. The backdoor overwrites the trojanized installer with the legitimate DeFi app executable, deleting the original trojanized file. 5. The backdoor initializes its configuration and connects to a command and control server, sending a beacon and waiting for directives. 6. The C2 server sends commands to gather system info, download files, execute processes, and control the compromised machine. 7. The backdoor executes the commands, gathering data and sending it encrypted over HTTP requests to the C2 server. 8. Stolen data is exfiltrated through the C2 channel. The backdoor continues operating on the infected machine, allowing the attacker to maintain access. 9. Meanwhile, the legitimate DeFi wallet app runs normally, deceiving the victim into thinking there is no infection.
