1. The attackers create a driver-based malware platform referred to as "Tilded" around 2007-2008. 2. The first known driver created on this platform is rndismpc.sys in January 2008. Its purpose is unknown. 3. The next driver created is mrxcls.sys in January 2009 which is the original driver used in Stuxnet. 4. A signed version of mrxcls.sys named rtniczw.sys is created in March 2010 but never observed in the wild. 5. Another signed driver jmidebs.sys is compiled in July 2010 also never used in known Stuxnet variants. 6. jmidebs.sys serves as the foundation for drivers used later in the Duqu malware created on the same platform. 7. New Duqu drivers are created in 2010-2011 with modified names and signing certificates but nearly identical functionality. 8. The attackers continuously modify the drivers by expanding the API functions and module injection code to avoid detection. 9. The platform and drivers evolve over time supporting multiple parallel projects including Stuxnet, Duqu, and potentially other unknown malware.
