1. Initial Access - The initial infection vector used to gain access is not specified. 2. Execution - MsMpEng.exe is abused to load a malicious DLL which contains shellcode. The shellcode decrypts and executes the final backdoor payload. 3. Installation - The backdoor installs itself by registering as a startup program or service for persistence. 4. C2 Comms - The backdoor connects to a C2 server and also utilizes the Dropbox API for command and control. 5. Action on Objectives - The backdoor exfiltrates system info, screenshots, keystrokes, and other data to the attacker's Dropbox. 6. Lateral Movement - The attacker uses tools like Mimikatz downloaded from Dropbox to move laterally. 7. Second Stage - A second backdoor is deployed that provides full control over Dropbox API. 8. Data Exfiltration - Sensitive documents and files are aggregated, compressed and exfiltrated to the attacker's Dropbox. 9. Defense Evasion - Different tokens are used for C2. Dropbox folders are cleared to hide activity.
