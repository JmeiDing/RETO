1. The attackers send phishing emails with weaponized Office document attachments containing exploits. 2. If the exploit is successful, a first stage shellcode decodes and launches a second stage shellcode. 3. The second stage shellcode decodes and installs a DLL backdoor module from the document. 4. The DLL backdoor is configured to contact an external C2 server to receive commands. 5. The malware establishes persistence via a Run registry key to execute on user login. 6. The backdoor can download additional modules or tools from the C2 server. 7. It uses HTTP requests with encryption to communicate and exfiltrate data to the C2 server. 8. Alternatively, it may use Poison Ivy as a backup RAT if the main C2 communication fails.
