 1. The attack starts with phishing emails or trojanized software to deliver the initial FinSpy droppers or installers. 2. The installers use obfuscation and multistage loading to eventually deploy the FinSpy trojan. 3. The FinSpy trojan establishes command and control communication to receive configurations. 4. Various plugins are leveraged to perform surveillance activities like keylogging, webcam access, communications interception etc. 5. Collected data from the infected device is intercepted and sent back to the attacker's command server. 6. In some cases bootkit infections are used for persistence to survive reboots and avoid detection.
