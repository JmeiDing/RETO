1. The threat actor distributed a spear phishing email containing a CAB file attachment impersonating a NIST document. 2. When the CAB file is executed, it extracts and runs the Loader.ReconHellcat executable. 3. The loader connects to a command and control server hosted on Cloudflare Workers infrastructure. 4. The C2 server sends the BlackSoul RAT executable and blacksoulLib DLL to the loader. 5. The loader runs BlackSoul, which imports functions from blacksoulLib. 6. blacksoulLib gathers system data and generates credentials for communicating with the C2 server. 7. BlackSoul sends commands and data to the C2 server over HTTPS using the Strapi API and JSON encoding. 8. The C2 server can send back commands to control the compromised machine.
