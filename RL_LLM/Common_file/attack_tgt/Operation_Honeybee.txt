1. The attack starts with a malicious Word document that contains a Visual Basic macro. 2. When the document is opened, the macro decodes and drops a CAB file containing additional malware components to the system. 3. The macro then extracts the CAB file contents to the system32 folder using utilities like wusa.exe or expand.exe to bypass UAC. 4. The macro executes the malicious DLL from the CAB file called NTWDBLIB.dll using cliconfg.exe to gain privileges and bypass UAC. 5. NTWDBLIB.dll executes batch scripts from the CAB file to install the main malware DLL payload called ipnet.dll as a service. 6. Ipnet.dll runs under svchost.exe and connects to a remote FTP server to receive commands. 7. The malware exfiltrates system info and running process data back to the command server. 8. The malware can execute additional commands downloaded from the server like uploading files, deleting files, and running executables.
