1. The attacker contacts targets using compromised LinkedIn accounts and directs them to a phishing site. 2. The phishing site hosts a weaponized document that when opened, fetches a malicious template file containing macro code. 3. The macro code executes and drops malware like Torisma ransomware or LazarusMTB backdoor. 4. The malware establishes command and control communication to receive additional payloads. 5. Stolen credentials are used to move laterally and infect other systems on the network via SMB and WMI. 6. The attacker collects data from compromised hosts and exfiltrates it using tunneling protocols and staging servers. 7. In other campaigns, the attacker compromises IT infrastructure like MSPs, websites and VPN services to distribute malware. 8. Remote access malware like VSingle and ValeforBeta are deployed to gain persistent access. 9. Lateral movement, C2 and exfiltration steps are repeated across the victim networks.
