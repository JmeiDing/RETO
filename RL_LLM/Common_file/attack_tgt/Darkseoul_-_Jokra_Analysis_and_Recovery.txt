 1. The malware gains disk access by opening the physical drive as a file. 2. It first overwrites the volume boot record (VBR) location at sector 56, which is the location on XP systems. 3. It then continues overwriting data in a loop using 512 byte patterns on XP and 1023 byte patterns on Windows 7. 4. The malware creates threads to overwrite all fixed drives it finds on the system. 5. It runs commands to kill security processes AhnLab Policy Agent and ViRobot ISMS. 6. It then runs a command to reboot the system quickly. 7. The wiping process happens rapidly, in 10-15 minutes. 8. The malware overwrites enough data to make the system unusable but does not wipe all data. 9. Using forensic tools like EnCase, the backup VBR can be recovered to restore the file system. 10. The MBR can also be repaired manually with a hex editor to boot the system, though some corruption will remain.
