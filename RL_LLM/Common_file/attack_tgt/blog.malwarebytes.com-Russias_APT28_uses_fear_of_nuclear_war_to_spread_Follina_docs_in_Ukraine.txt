1. APT28 sends a weaponized Word document titled "Nuclear Terrorism A Very Real Threat.rtf" to victims in Ukraine. 2. The document discusses fears over potential nuclear escalation in the Russia-Ukraine war. 3. If the victim opens the document, it uses the Follina exploit to retrieve and execute a remote HTML file. 4. The HTML file runs a PowerShell command to download and execute a .NET-based credential stealer. 5. The stealer collects saved passwords, cookies, and other credentials from Chrome, Edge, Firefox web browsers. 6. The stolen browser data is exfiltrated via IMAP to a command and control server operated by APT28. 7. APT28 can then leverage the stolen credentials for further access and espionage. 8. Overall, APT28 is able to use the lure document and exploit to gain a foothold and harvest sensitive data from target systems.
