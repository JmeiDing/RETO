 1. Threat actors send spearphishing emails spoofing financial institutions to targets. 2. The emails contain links to download a ZIP archive named dog.zip. 3. The ZIP archive contains obfuscated JavaScript code named dog.js. 4. The JavaScript deobfuscates itself and drops an obfuscated PowerShell script called setup.ps1. 5. Setup.ps1 contains a PowerShell Empire stager that creates another obfuscated PowerShell script called checkupdate.ps1. 6. Checkupdate.ps1 uses a reflective loader technique to load the SOCKSBOT malware implant into memory. 7. SOCKSBOT establishes communications with a command and control server to enable further intrusion activity. 8. The malware can capture screenshots, log keystrokes, download files, and execute arbitrary commands on compromised hosts.
