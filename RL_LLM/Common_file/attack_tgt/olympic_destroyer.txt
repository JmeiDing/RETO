1. The attack starts with spear-phishing emails containing weaponized Office documents. 2. The documents have macros that when enabled install the first stage of the malware - a PowerShell script. 3. The PowerShell script downloads and executes another PowerShell script which installs the backdoor components of OlympicDestroyer. 4. OlympicDestroyer spreads through the network as a worm using stolen credentials. 5. It has a wiper component that deletes files on network shares and resets event logs and backups. 6. The wiper runs for 60 minutes before rebooting infected systems into an unbootable state.
