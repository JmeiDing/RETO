1. The attacker sends a malicious Office document to the victim. 2. When the document is opened, it triggers a multistage infection chain on the victim's system. 3. The infection chain performs tasks to escalate privileges, evade detection, and deploy the KONNI RAT files. 4. The final payload is the KONNI RAT which consists of a .dll file and a .ini configuration file. 5. The .dll file contains the RAT capabilities and functionality. 6. The .ini file contains the initial command and control server address. 7. KONNI RAT establishes communication with the C2 server to enable the attacker to control the compromised system. 8. New KONNI versions encrypt strings and files using AES derived from service names and filenames. 9. Data sent to the C2 is uniquely encrypted per file using the timestamp. 10. Some versions use a custom packer to obfuscate code flow and insert junk code to evade analysis. 11. The attacker can leverage KONNI RAT to maintain persistent access and control of the compromised system.
