1. The attacker sends a phishing email with the HUI Loader malware attached or embedded. 2. If the victim executes HUI Loader, it installs itself on the system and establishes persistence using services, registry keys, or startup folders. 3. HUI Loader disables security features like ETW logging and AMSI scanning to evade detection. 4. It uses a password to decrypt and load the encoded malware payload, such as PlugX or PoisonIvy. 5. The decrypted malware then executes on the infected system allowing the attacker remote access, exfiltration, and further exploitation.
