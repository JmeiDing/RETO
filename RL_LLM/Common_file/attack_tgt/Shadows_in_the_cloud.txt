1. The attackers create accounts on social media sites like Twitter and Google Groups to use as command and control channels. 2. They send spearphishing emails to victims with malicious document attachments exploiting software vulnerabilities. 3. If a victim opens the attachment, malware is installed on their computer which connects to the command and control channels. 4. The attackers post links on the social media sites to direct the infected computers to download additional malware components. 5. The malware exfiltrates sensitive documents from the victim's computer and uploads them to drop sites controlled by the attackers. 6. The command and control sites on social media are used to update the malware with new instructions and keep persistence on infected hosts. 7. Core command and control servers hosted on domains in China give the malware a stable backup infrastructure if other sites are taken down. 8. The attackers retrieve sensitive documents from the drop sites and analyze the data to enable further intelligence gathering. 9. Information extracted from documents is combined with other sources to build up profiles on targets. 10. The malware infection provides persistent access to harvest further documents and data from the victim's network over time.
