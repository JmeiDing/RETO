1. BlueNoroff sends a phishing email with a weaponized attachment, typically a malicious Word doc. 2. The doc connects to a remote server and downloads the initial payload, an executable that bypasses UAC. 3. The executable fetches and executes a downloader script written in Visual Basic Script or Batch. 4. The downloader script executes legitimate Windows commands and binaries to evade detection. It fetches the next-stage payload from a command-and-control server. 5. The downloaded payload is a DLL that is injected into the Explorer process. It contains an encrypted configuration that fetches the final malware using cURL. 6. The final payload is a backdoor that gives the attacker remote access. It is similar to malware used in previous BlueNoroff campaigns. 7. The backdoor allows the attacker to fingerprint the victim system, install additional malware, and move laterally. 8. In some cases, the initial doc attachment contains macros that install a shortcut to a malware downloader. When opened, the shortcut executes the infection routine. 9. To bypass MOTW warnings, ISO and VHD images containing scripts are used instead of Office docs. Scripts fetch and run malware from URLs. 10. BlueNoroff registers lookalike domains impersonating financial companies to host malware. Targets in Japan are of particular interest currently.
