 1. The wiper malware contains IP addresses of command and control (C2) servers hardcoded in the files. 2. The malware sends beacons containing the infected host's IP address and hostname to the C2 servers. 3. The beacon payload is constructed by allocating a buffer that is too large, resulting in extra data from the stack being included. 4. The malware overwrites systems by wiping data to render it inaccessible. 5. The wiping can cover up other malicious activity and make investigation difficult.
