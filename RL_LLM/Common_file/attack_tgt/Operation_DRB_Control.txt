 1. The attackers send spear-phishing emails with weaponized Office documents to victims. 2. When the document is opened, malware is downloaded onto the victim's system. 3. The initial malware either contains or downloads a remote access trojan/backdoor. 4. The backdoor connects to command and control servers controlled by the attackers. 5. The attackers leverage the access provided by the backdoor to steal data, distribute additional payloads, and move laterally in the victim network. 6. Stolen data like source code and databases are exfiltrated back to the attackers. 7. New versions of the backdoors are deployed over time to evade detection, expand capabilities, and use new infrastructure.
