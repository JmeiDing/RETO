 1. NewsBeef sends spearphishing emails with macro-enabled Office documents to targets. 2. The macro documents contain PowerShell scripts that download poisoned software installers when opened. 3. The poisoned installers are programs like Flash or Chrome but execute PowerSploit scripts when run. 4. The PowerSploit scripts download and execute the Pupy backdoor. 5. Pupy communicates over Tor to a command and control server controlled by NewsBeef. 6. NewsBeef can send modules over Pupy to further access the infected system. 7. In other attacks, NewsBeef compromises websites to inject JavaScript code. 8. The JavaScript redirects visitors to NewsBeef controlled sites based on their IP and other data. 9. These sites can then deliver the macro documents or other malicious payloads to infect the visitors.
