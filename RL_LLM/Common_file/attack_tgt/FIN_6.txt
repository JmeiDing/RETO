 1. FIN6 compromises the e-commerce platform of provider Volusion. 2. Attackers inject malicious code into a JavaScript library used by Volusion customers. 3. The injected code loads a skimmer script from Google Cloud Storage. 4. The skimmer captures payment info entered on online checkout forms. 5. Stolen payment data is stored in session storage on the compromised sites. 6. When the payment page loads again, the skimmer exfiltrates the stolen card data via POST request to a domain mimicking Volusion infrastructure. 7. FIN6 receives the exfiltrated payment data for monetization.
