 1. The attack starts with a spear phishing email containing a malicious attachment, typically a Word doc exploiting a vulnerability like CVE-2012-0158. 2. The attachment contains macros that execute a downloader executable, which installs a remote access trojan like Hanove. 3. The initial trojan sends system info to a C2 and can download additional modules. 4. Secondary tools like keyloggers, credential stealers, and uploaders exfiltrate documents and data. 5. The exfiltrated data is encrypted and sent to attacker controlled servers via HTTP or FTP. 6. New commands and modules are pushed to infected hosts from the C2 servers. 7. Social engineering is adapted to targets based on region, language, and interests. 8. Custom malware is developed in an organized framework involving multiple developers. 9. Infrastructure spans domains, IP addresses, hosting providers connected to individuals/companies in India.
