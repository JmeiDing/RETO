1. The ShadowPad malware is installed on a victim's system, likely through phishing emails, exploits, or other delivery vectors. 2. ShadowPad establishes communications with a C2 server over TCP, HTTP(S), or UDP protocols. It goes through an initial handshake where encryption keys are exchanged. 3. The C2 server sends commands to the infected host to carry out actions like stealing data, installing plugins, running processes, etc. 4. ShadowPad gathers data from the compromised system as instructed by the C2 server. This may include files, system information, browser data, etc. 5. The stolen data is encrypted and exfiltrated by ShadowPad to the C2 server over the established network communications. 6. The attacker can leverage the exfiltrated data to further infiltrate the target network or organization. 7. ShadowPad maintains persistence on the system for long-term compromise by modifying registries etc. 8. The malware continues communicating with the C2 server to receive new commands, exfiltrate data, and maintain control of the compromised system.
