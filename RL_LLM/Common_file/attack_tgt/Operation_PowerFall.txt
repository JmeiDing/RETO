 1. A malicious script targeting Internet Explorer triggers a use-after-free vulnerability (CVE-2020-1380) in the JScript engine. This allows arbitrary code execution in the browser. 2. The code execution in the browser loads a DLL containing a Windows elevation of privilege exploit (CVE-2020-0986). 3. The Windows exploit achieves code execution in the splwow64.exe process with medium integrity, escaping the sandbox. 4. The code in splwow64.exe executes an obfuscated PowerShell command to download a file called upgrader.exe. 5. The upgrader.exe file would then presumably be executed to carry out further malicious actions, but this was prevented by Kaspersky.
