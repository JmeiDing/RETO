 1. NOBELIUM sends spear phishing emails with HTML attachments to targets. 2. The HTML attachments use HTML smuggling to extract ISO files when opened by the victim. 3. The ISO files contain HTA files with messages purporting to be from the embassy being targeted. 4. The HTA files execute PowerShell code that stores shellcode in the registry. 5. The PowerShell code loads the shellcode from the registry which contains a Cobalt Strike beacon. 6. The shellcode decrypts and executes the Cobalt Strike beacon to establish C2 with NOBELIUM. 7. NOBELIUM interacts with the victim machine through the Cobalt Strike beacon for further exploitation. 8. NOBELIUM registered domains a year prior and recently set up C2 servers on VPS instances. 9. The servers use a tool called cs2nginx to proxy Cobalt Strike traffic. 10. Additional suspected domains are identified that may be tied to NOBELIUM or other actors using similar techniques.
