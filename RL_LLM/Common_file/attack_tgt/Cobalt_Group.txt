 1. Cobalt registers phishing domains and sets up infrastructure to send spearphishing emails. 2. The group sends emails with malicious attachments, often Office documents exploiting vulnerabilities, to employees at target organizations. 3. If the user opens the attachment, it downloads a malware dropper which installs the Beacon trojan for remote access. 4. Cobalt leverages the initial access to move laterally in the network and send more phishing emails to other employees from compromised accounts. 5. The attackers collect sensitive data from systems via Beacon and other tools. 6. Cobalt monetizes the access by manipulating financial systems, stealing funds, or obtaining data to enable future fraud. 7. The group covers its tracks by deleting logs, maintaining persistence, and exfiltrating data via encrypted channels. 8. Cobalt continually registers new phishing domains and updates malware to evade defenses.
