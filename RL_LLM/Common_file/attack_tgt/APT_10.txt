 1. Gained initial access by using stolen credentials to log in to Citrix servers. 2. Moved laterally and escalated privileges on the network. 3. Deployed malware via DLL sideloading, including Trochilus and UPPERCUT. 4. Leveraged legitimate tools for enumeration, credential access, and data theft. 5. Exfiltrated data to Dropbox accounts under attacker control. 6. Maintained access via webshells and other means. So in summary, it was a cyberespionage campaign using credential compromise, lateral movement, malware deployment, and cloud services for data theft.
