 1. The client application is installed on the victim's machine, often a local government device. It uses a layered deployment method, including: Abusing a legitimate executable XCrSvr.exe to load the side-loaded DLL XecureIO_v20.dll. The DLL executes shellcode containing the main malware modules 2. The installer module establishes persistence on the infected system via techniques like: Adding a run key registry entry to execute on boot. Creating a malicious service. Modifying logon scripts 3. The installer deletes original malware files after installation. 4. The loader DLL retrieves the encryption key from the registry and uses it to decrypt the next-stage payloads. 5. The client application phones home to the C2 server via HTTP beaconing. It sends encrypted info about the infected system. 6. The server application allows attackers to remotely control the compromised device by loading additional modules. It supports functions like file management, command execution, etc. 7. Communications between client and server are encrypted using RC4 and LZO algorithms. A CRC32 checksum is used to verify received data.
