 1. Malicious Word docs are sent via phishing emails. When opened, embedded macros execute scripts that drop additional malware. 2. A Visual Basic script fetches data from Pastebin and Google Docs to retrieve encoded PowerShell scripts. 3. The PowerShell scripts are decoded and executed to set up a persistent reverse shell backdoor connecting to external servers. 4. Lateral movement occurs via pass-the-hash attacks to steal credentials and gain admin access across the network. 5. Custom malware like Carbanak, Cobalt Strike, and data exfiltration tools are deployed across compromised systems. 6. Google services are leveraged for command and control to issue commands and exfiltrate data from victims. 7. Additional payloads are downloaded over time and new control servers are rotated in to maintain persistence.
