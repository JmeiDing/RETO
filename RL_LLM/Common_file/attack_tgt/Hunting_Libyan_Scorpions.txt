1. In August 2016, CSIRT received reports of Android malware spreading in Libya via the Telegram messaging app. 2. The malware was first discovered after a high-profile Telegram account was compromised from an IP address in Spain. 3. The attackers then used the compromised account to spread malware disguised as a voice message to the account's contacts. 4. The malware spreads to more Android devices through infected contacts reposting it. 5. The malware allows the threat actors to track locations and monitor targets. 6. The threat actor group, named the Libyan Scorpions by CSIRT, uses the information for politically-motivated intelligence gathering and spying.
