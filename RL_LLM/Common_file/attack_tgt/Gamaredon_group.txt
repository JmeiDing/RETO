 1. Gamaredon sends spearphishing emails with malicious Office document attachments. 2. Victims open the attachments, triggering malicious macros. 3. The macros execute scripts that download additional malware components. 4. Malware components like backdoors search for sensitive documents on the system. 5. Backdoors exfiltrate any discovered documents to Gamaredon's command and control servers. 6. The Outlook macro module composes emails to contacts with malicious attachments to spread infection laterally. 7. Macro injector modules insert malicious macros into existing Office documents on compromised systems. 8. When users open those compromised documents later, the malicious macros execute to further penetrate the network.
