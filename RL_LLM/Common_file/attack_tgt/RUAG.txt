1. Initial infection via watering hole attacks using fingerprinting scripts to identify targets. Malware establishes command and control channel. 2. Recon malware gathers system information and can be replaced by full-featured stage 2 malware. 3. Stage 2 malware uses peer-to-peer botnet for internal communication and spreading. 4. Lateral movement through credential harvesting and tools like Mimikatz and PsExec to gain control of devices and data. 5. Active Directory compromise to gain permissions. 6. Slow and intermittent data exfiltration over months using encrypted HTTP posts to command and control servers.
