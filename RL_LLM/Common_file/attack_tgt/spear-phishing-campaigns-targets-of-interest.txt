 1. The actors research potential targets through open sources and build profiles. 2. They establish fake online accounts impersonating experts or known contacts of the target. 3. They make initial benign contact with targets over an extended period to build rapport. 4. Once trust is established, they send emails with malicious links impersonating known contacts. 5. The links direct targets to fake login pages designed to harvest credentials. 6. The actors use the stolen credentials to access targets' email accounts. 7. They gather further information from compromised accounts for additional targeting. 8. They set up mail forwarding rules on accounts to maintain access to emails. 9. They use details from compromised accounts to conduct further phishing attempts. 10. The cycle continues as they compromise additional accounts and harvest more information.
