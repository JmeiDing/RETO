 1. The first attack starts with victims downloading a malicious Freegate installer containing a legitimate copy of Freegate and the ShadowTech Rat malware. 2. When run, the installer drops and executes the ShadowTech Rat which connects to a command and control server on a Syrian IP address. 3. The implant exfiltrates data and allows the attacker remote access to the compromised machine. 4. In the second attack, targets receive an email containing a ZIP file purporting to be a video from a Saudi cleric. 5. The ZIP file contains a Windows shortcut that when clicked directs victims through a social engineering attack. 6. Victims are shown a decoy YouTube video or news article while malware is downloaded from a PHP script in the background. 7. The malware executable is extracted from the PHP script and executed on the victim's machine. 8. The new malware adds registry keys to maintain persistence and connects to a command and control server on a Syrian IP address. 9. It attempts to download additional components from the command and control server. 10. The malware uses crypters and decoys to avoid detection while compromising the victim's machine.
