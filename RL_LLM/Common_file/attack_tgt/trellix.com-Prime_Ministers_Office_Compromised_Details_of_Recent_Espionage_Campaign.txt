 1. The attack starts with an Excel file sent via email that exploits CVE-2021-40444 to execute a malicious DLL downloader. 2. The downloader retrieves and executes the Graphite malware, which uses OneDrive and the Microsoft Graph API for command and control. 3. Graphite gathers system info and can execute additional Empire payloads. 4. An Empire DLL launcher stager executes and starts the .NET CLR. 5. The stager decrypts and loads an Empire PowerShell stager, which executes an obfuscated PowerShell script. 6. The PowerShell script reaches out to the attacker's server to download and execute the final Empire agent payload.
