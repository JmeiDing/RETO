1. The attackers impersonate recruiters on LinkedIn and build trust with targets. 2. The attackers send victims an ISO file containing trojanized PuTTY/KiTTY/TightVNC software and credentials via WhatsApp. 3. When victims open the trojanized software and enter the provided credentials, it triggers the malware. 4. The trojanized software executes shellcode that decrypts and loads a malicious DLL payload. 5. The DLL payload connects to a C2 server and can receive commands like executing arbitrary code. 6. The payload collects system info like OS version, processes, etc. and sends it encrypted to the C2. 7. Some variants establish persistence using DLL hijacking and scheduled tasks. 8. The attackers are able to compromise the system and move laterally in the victim's network. 9. The attackers exfiltrate data from the compromised network.
