1. The attackers set up two command and control servers in 2012 to manage the Flamer malware campaign. 2. The Newsforyou web application on the servers communicates with compromised machines using encrypted protocols. 3. Flamer malware on victim machines uploads stolen data to the C&C servers. This data is encrypted. 4. The attackers download the stolen data archives from the servers using the control panel. 5. The servers distribute payload modules, including one that orders Flamer to delete itself from machines. 6. The servers are configured to minimize logging and wipe data to avoid getting caught if compromised. 7. However, some files remain that reveal details about the attackers' infrastructure and activities. 8. In total, 189 stolen data files and 5.7GB of archives were recovered from the two servers. 9. The stolen data came from infected machines in Israel and other Middle Eastern countries. 10. The operation shows signs of ongoing development and significant resources, pointing to a likely state sponsor.
