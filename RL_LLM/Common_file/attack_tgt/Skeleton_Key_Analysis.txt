Actors use PsExec tool to remotely run Skeleton Key DLL on domain controllers, configuring a password. 6. Skeleton Key patches LSASS process memory to bypass authentication. 7. Actors can now authenticate as any AD user with the configured password. 8. Skeleton Key DLL file is deleted after deployment. 9.
