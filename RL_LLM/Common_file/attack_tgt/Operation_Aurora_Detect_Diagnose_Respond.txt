1. The attack starts with a malicious JavaScript exploiting IE6 to download an encrypted dropper executable. 2. The shellcode decrypts the dropper and executes it. The dropper extracts and installs the trojan payload. 3. The trojan payload establishes persistence as a service and deletes installation files. 4. The service makes HTTPS requests to command servers to receive configurations. 5. The trojan can execute commands from the server like uploading files and running arbitrary commands. 6. Network traffic uses a custom encryption scheme to communicate with command servers. 7. The malware is updated over time and evolved to avoid detection.
