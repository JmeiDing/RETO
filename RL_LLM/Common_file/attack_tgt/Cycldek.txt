1. The attacker sends phishing emails with RTF document attachments containing exploits to targets. 2. If the exploit is successful, it executes a dropper that installs three files: - A signed executable (like a legitimate AV utility) - A malicious DLL - An encrypted payload binary 3. The signed executable is used to load the malicious DLL through a technique called DLL side-loading. 4. The malicious DLL contains code to decrypt and execute the payload binary. 5. The payload is a RAT malware called NewCore (with custom BlueCore and RedCore variants). 6. NewCore establishes command and control communication to download additional malware. 7. Further tools are deployed the same way - as side-loaded DLLs of signed utilities. 8. These additional tools enable lateral movement, remote access, and data exfiltration. 9. In some cases, tools like USBCulprit are used to extract data to USB drives.
