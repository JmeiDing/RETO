1. Andariel compromises internet-facing web services like WebLogic servers using exploits for vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-10271. 2. The compromised servers are used to distribute Powershell scripts that retrieve additional scripts and tools like 3proxy. 3. The scripts install malware like DTrack, which gathers system information and data for exfiltration. 4. DTrack is used to collect data and maintain persistence on systems for several months. 5. Eventually, Maui ransomware is deployed onto selected systems, about 10 hours after DTrack. 6. Maui encrypts files on the system and leaves a ransom note demanding cryptocurrency payment. 7. Andariel selectively deploys Maui to target organizations likely to yield financial gain from ransoms. 8. The ransomware asks for payment in exchange for the decryption key to recover encrypted files.
