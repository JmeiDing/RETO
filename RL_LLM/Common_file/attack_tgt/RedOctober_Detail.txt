1. Initial infection via spearphishing emails with malicious Office document attachments containing exploits. 2. Malicious documents execute droppers which install backdoor components on the victim system. 3. Backdoors contact command and control servers to receive additional intelligence-gathering modules. 4. Modules gather data from the infected system and local network, including files, system info, mobile devices, etc. 5. Collected data is encrypted and exfiltrated back to attacker-controlled servers. 6. Attackers continuously develop new modules to expand capabilities and customize attacks for targets. 7. Complex infrastructure of proxies is used to hide the main C&C servers.
