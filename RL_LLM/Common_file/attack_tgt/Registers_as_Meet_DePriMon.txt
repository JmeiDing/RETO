1. Initial compromise vector unknown, but DePriMon's second and third stages are delivered to the victim's system. 2. The second stage installs itself and the third stage using reflective DLL loading. It registers the third stage as a "Windows Default Print Monitor" port monitor for persistence. 3. At system startup, the registered third stage DLL gets loaded by spoolsv.exe with SYSTEM privileges. 4. The third stage communicates with C&C servers over encrypted TLS using the Windows Secure Channel. It decrypts configs only when needed. 5. The third stage collects basic system info and downloads additional payloads from the C&C servers.
