1. The initial dropper is executed on the victim system, likely via Windows Command Shell. It installs the persistent loader. 2. The persistent loader unpacks and injects the main module into a system process like lsass.exe. 3. The main module sets up command and control communication and injects the networking module to send and receive data. 4. Additional modules like GetMicInfo and ModScan are downloaded from the C2 server. 5. GetMicInfo decrypts and extracts database passwords and configuration data from the registry. 6. ModScan can scan IP addresses and fingerprint the POS software environment. 7. Data is exfiltrated to the C2 server via the networking module. 8. The main module can also receive commands from the C2 server to further control the compromised machine.
