1. The attackers send phishing emails with malware attachments to a large number of targets. 2. If the target opens the attachment, a dropper is executed. 3. The dropper installs and executes the Gh0stRAT payload DLL. 4. Gh0stRAT establishes command and control communication using a custom protocol. 5. The attackers send commands to the RAT for further exploitation, data exfiltration, etc. 6. Gh0stRAT maintains persistence by adding a Run registry key and batch script to restart itself after reboots.
