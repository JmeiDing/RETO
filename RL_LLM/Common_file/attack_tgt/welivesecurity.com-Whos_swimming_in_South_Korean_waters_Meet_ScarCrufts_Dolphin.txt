 1. ScarCruft conducted a watering hole attack on a South Korean online newspaper website, using a malicious JavaScript exploit. 2. The JavaScript exploit targeted an Internet Explorer vulnerability (CVE-2020-1380) to execute shellcode on the victim's computer. 3. The shellcode downloaded and deployed BLUELIGHT, a ScarCruft backdoor. 4. BLUELIGHT then selectively deployed the more advanced Dolphin backdoor on specific targets. 5. Dolphin established persistence and command and control via Google Drive storage. 6. Dolphin exfiltrated documents, screenshots, keystrokes, and other data to Google Drive. It also monitored drives and portable devices, automatically stealing files with certain extensions. 7. Earlier versions of Dolphin could modify victims' Google account settings to enable IMAP and lower security, likely to maintain access to email inboxes after credentials were stolen.
