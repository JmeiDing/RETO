1. Malware is configured to communicate with an observable command and control (C2) server. 2. The C2 server is running HTran software to redirect and bounce traffic to a hidden destination server. 3. If HTran fails to connect to the hidden server, it returns an error message revealing the intended destination. 4. Researchers scan network traffic for the HTran error signature to uncover hidden servers. 5. Analysis of the hidden server IPs reveals they are located on major Chinese networks. 6. The hidden infrastructure is part of China-based Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns.
