1. Attackers obtained a code signing certificate issued to an Indian company in late 2011. 2. They used the certificate to sign malicious binaries from March to June 2012. Over 70 signed malware samples were created. 3. Two infection vectors were used: - Exploiting CVE-2012-0158 in malicious Office documents that download and execute malware. - PE files disguised as Word or PDF documents distributed via email that contain droppers. 4. The droppers install various payloads on the infected system: - Downloaders to get additional malware - Keyloggers - Screenshot takers - Tools to search and upload documents 5. The payloads exfiltrate data from the infected system and send it unencrypted to attacker servers. 6. Over 20 domains were used for command and control, hosted by providers known to host malware. 7. Telemetry showed malware variants originating from the same region in India. 8. While globally distributed, infections were concentrated in Pakistan as the main target. 9. The malware used basic obfuscation and persistence methods, lacking sophistication. 10. The campaign is believed to have origins in India and be focused on stealing sensitive data from Pakistan over at least two years.
