1. A malicious executable is executed on the victim machine. 2. The executable drops a batch file (install.bat) and a cabinet file (data.cab) containing encrypted shellcode and a DLL. 3. The batch file executes to decompress and run the DLL. 4. The shellcode decrypts itself and loads plugins from the attacker. 5. The primary RAT tool "Mozilla" connects to the C2 server over SSL or TCP. 6. The attacker sends plugins to the victim machine via Mozilla. These plugins enable capabilities like command execution, file transfer, etc. 7. Network traffic is encrypted with RC4 using a per-message key. 8. The attacker makes use of the access and capabilities provided by the RAT plugins.
