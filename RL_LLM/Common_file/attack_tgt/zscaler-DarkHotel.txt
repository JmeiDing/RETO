 1. The initial attack starts with a spear phishing email containing a multilayer Word document. 2. The document loads an embedded DOCX file that contains a malicious RTF file. 3. The RTF file drops and executes a scriptlet file called googleofficechk.sct. 4. The scriptlet exfiltrates system info and drops two binaries. 5. One binary performs UAC bypass to execute the second dropped binary. 6. The second binary registers a malicious service for persistence. 7. The service executes obfuscated PowerShell scripts. 8. The PowerShell scripts contain an encoded .NET backdoor payload. 9. The .NET backdoor connects to C2 servers to exfiltrate system info and download additional modules.
