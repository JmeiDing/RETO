 1. The group conducts phishing campaigns using disposable emails and domains to target victims. The phishing emails contain malicious links or attachments. 2. If the victim clicks the link or opens the attachment, the first stage malware is downloaded. This is typically an executable that retrieves additional malware from paste sites. 3. The second stage malware establishes persistence and retrieves more malware. This includes downloading scripts, executables, and compiled malware from various sources. 4. One of the later stages is a remote access trojan (RAT) that can exfiltrate data from the victim machine. 5. The RAT searches for files and data of interest based on keywords and file extensions. It compresses and encrypts this data. 6. The RAT periodically uploads the stolen data to one of the command and control servers used by the group. 7. The group rotates through various domains and IP addresses for their C2 infrastructure over time.
