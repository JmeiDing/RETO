 1. A VMProtected launcher executes and decrypts the embedded payload, which is the Winnti Group's custom packer. 2. The custom packer decrypts and extracts a component called Inner-Loader. 3. Inner-Loader injects the skip-2.0 DLL into the sqlserv.exe process. 4. Skip-2.0 installs hooks in sqllang.dll to bypass authentication and disable logging. 5. If the magic password is provided at login, the hooks allow access and block logging to hide the unauthorized activity. 6. This allows the attacker to maintain stealthy access to manipulate or steal data from the compromised MSSQL Server.
