1. The attack starts with malicious files sent via LinkedIn or email pretending to be job offers. 2. The files install an initial downloader malware if opened by the victim. 3. The downloader installs the main backdoor payload which communicates with a C2 server. 4. The backdoor establishes an encrypted HTTPS session with the C2 server using a custom protocol to exchange nonces. 5. The backdoor sends requests to the C2 server to receive commands to execute on the victim system. 6. Supported commands allow the malware to download additional modules, exfiltrate files, and execute code. 7. The backdoor collects system information and sensitive files which are archived and exfiltrated to attacker servers. 8. The attackers move laterally through the network compromising additional systems. 9. In one case, the attackers performed a business email compromise using the access.
