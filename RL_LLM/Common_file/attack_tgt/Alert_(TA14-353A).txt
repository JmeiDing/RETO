 1. Initial compromise via the SMB worm spreading through brute force attacks on SMB shares. 2. Worm calls back to C2 and can spread laterally, dropping additional backdoors, proxy tools, etc. 3. Hard drive and MBR wipers are executed, destroying data and rendering systems unbootable. 4. Backdoors and proxy tools facilitate continued access and exfiltration of data. 5. Attackers maintain persistent access to compromised networks.
