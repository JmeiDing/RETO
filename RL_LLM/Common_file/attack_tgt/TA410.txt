1. The attacker sends a phishing email with weaponized document attachment impersonating organizations relevant to the target. 2. If the victim enables macros, a downloader is launched that fetches malware payloads from the attacker's command and control server. 3. Downloaded payloads include modular components like droppers, installers, scripts, and final RATs. 4. Malware utilizes legitimate executables and protocols alongside malicious files for stealth. 5. Installation establishes persistence via registry modifications, scheduled tasks, and service creation. 6. The LookBack or FlowCloud RAT provides remote access, exfiltrates data, and allows lateral movement. 7. RATs communicate with command servers via encrypted protocols to receive commands and exfiltrate data. 8. TA410 operators interact with compromised hosts to meet objectives like reconnaissance and data theft. 9. Infrastructure evolves over campaigns and payloads are updated to evade detection, maintain persistence, and enhance capabilities.
