1. The threat actor sends a spear phishing email containing a weaponized attachment to targets in Russia. 2. Lures include Ukraine-themed files, fake patches, job ads, and Rostec-themed documents. 3. The attachment contains macros, scripts, or templates to download the custom RAT payload. 4. Initial scripts execute the RAT payload, typically a DLL loaded via rundll32. 5. The RAT uses encrypted C2 communications to receive commands from its C2 server. 6. Commands enable the RAT to fingerprint the infected system, run arbitrary commands, upload/download files. 7. The RAT exfiltrates data from the compromised system back to the C2 server. 8. Infrastructure links suggest the threat actor may be linked to Chinese APT groups. 9. The attacker is able to maintain persistent access to infected machines for espionage.
