 1. The attackers exploit the Confluence CVE-2019-3396 vulnerability to gain initial access and infect systems. 2. The Dacls malware is installed on compromised Linux and Windows systems. It connects to command and control servers for further instructions. 3. The malware uses encrypted TLS and RC4 communication to receive commands from the C2 server. Commands can include executing system commands, managing files, killing processes and more. 4. Plugins extend the functionality of Dacls. The reverse proxy plugin hides direct connections to the C2 server. The log send plugin exfiltrates data and scans the network. 5. The malware collects system information like process lists and directory contents and exfiltrates that data to attacker controlled log servers. 6. The modular architecture and encryption allow Dacls to operate stealthily on compromised systems. The attackers can use it to carry out further penetration into targeted networks. 7. The authors recommend organizations patch Confluence, monitor for signs of Dacls infection through indicators of compromise, and block associated IP addresses and domains.
