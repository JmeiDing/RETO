1. Attackers compromised the Fishpig distribution server on or before August 19, 2022. 2. The attackers injected malware into Fishpig's paid Magento extensions. Specifically into the License.php file which is used to validate Fishpig licenses. 3. When Magento administrators visit the Fishpig control panel, the malware triggers and downloads a Linux binary called lic.bin from the attacker's server. 4. The lic.bin file is actually the Rekoobe remote access trojan (RAT). It executes on the server and hides itself as a background system process. 5. The malware connects to a command and control server located at 46.183.217.2 in Latvia. 6. The malware awaits commands from the control server to steal data or perform other malicious actions on compromised Magento stores. 7. Fishpig unknowingly distributed the backdoored extensions to customers through software updates since mid-August. 8. Any Magento stores that installed Fishpig updates since then likely have the malware installed, giving attackers admin access.
