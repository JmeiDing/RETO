1. The malware sample is executed on the victim's system. 2. It copies itself to a new file name in the AppData folder. 3. It extracts and executes a second file called PerfWatson.exe. 4. A registry run key is created for persistence to execute PerfWatson.exe. 5. An encrypted .NET DLL embedded in resources is decrypted and loaded into memory using Assembly.Load(). 6. Encrypted RAT settings and payload extracted from image files in resources. 7. The RAT payload is injected into a new process using process hollowing techniques. 8. The RAT payload executes completely in memory of the new process. 9. The RAT connects back to a command and control server. 10. The PerfWatson.exe monitor process ensures stealthy operation. 11. Traditional antivirus evaded since no decrypted payloads touch disk. 12. Behavior analysis can detect the injection and other anomalies at the kernel level.
