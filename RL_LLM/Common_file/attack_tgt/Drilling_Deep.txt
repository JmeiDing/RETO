1. Perform reconnaissance on targets like employee email addresses, network infrastructure, etc. APT33 gathers intelligence on targets before attacks. 2. Send spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments, often posing as job recruitment postings. APT33 has done this for years. 3. Compromise computers via the malicious attachments, which typically download first-stage backdoors and PowerShell scripts. 4. Use webshells, backdoors, and credential theft tools to move laterally in the network. APT33 has used webshells for early infection stages. 5. Plant additional malware and install persistent backdoors for long-term access. APT33 constantly updates malware to avoid detection. 6. Exfiltrate sensitive documents and data like exploration info, drilling techniques, etc. This can then enable further sabotage. 7. Optionally destroy systems and disrupt operations via wipers like Shamoon. This is done by state-linked groups. 8. Obfuscate infrastructure and malware C&C using proxies, VPNs, domain rotation, and other tactics. APT33 takes extensive measures to hide small botnets. 9. Leverage compromised access and intelligence to enable physical attacks. The drone attack in Saudi Arabia had cyber factors. 10. Hold data and systems for ransom via dedicated ransomware campaigns. Criminals tailor ransomware targeting to maximize damage.
