 1. Attackers send emails with malicious attachments, likely via spearphishing, to targets. 2. The attachment is a bundled file containing both a decoy document (like a PDF or Excel file) and a RAT installer executable. 3. When the user opens the attachment, the decoy document is displayed to the user. 4. In the background, the RAT installer executable runs and drops a DLL file on the system. 5. The DLL file is injected into the svchost.exe process. 6. The injected DLL connects to the command and control server to register the infection. 7. The RAT sends system information like computer name, IP address, etc. to the C2 along with a campaign code. 8. The RAT receives and executes commands from the C2 server like uploading files, running processes, opening a remote shell, etc.
