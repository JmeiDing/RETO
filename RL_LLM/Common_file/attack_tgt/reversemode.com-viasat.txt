 1. The attackers compromised a VPN appliance to gain access to Viasat's management network. The method is unclear - either stolen credentials or exploiting a vulnerability. 2. Through the management network, the attackers abused the TR-069 protocol which enables installing arbitrary binaries on the modems without verification. 3. The attackers used TR-069 to deploy the AcidRain wiper malware described by SentinelOne. 4. AcidRain corrupted the flash memory of the modems with a destructive payload, knocking them offline. 5. The attack propagated to modems across Europe over several hours, but the exact mechanism is unknown.
