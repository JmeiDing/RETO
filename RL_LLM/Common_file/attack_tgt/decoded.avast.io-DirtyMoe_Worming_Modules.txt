1. Reconnaissance: The module generates a list of target IP addresses to attack based on its geographic location. 2. Scanning: The target IPs are scanned for open ports to identify vulnerable services. 3. Exploitation: Known vulnerabilities like EternalBlue and deserialization bugs are exploited to gain remote code execution on targets. 4. Installation: A PowerShell command is executed to install a new DirtyMoe instance via a downloaded MSI file. 5. Persistence: DirtyMoe configures persistence mechanisms like startup tasks so it runs automatically on boot. 6. Lateral movement: The module brute forces accounts on the compromised host's local network using a password dictionary. 7. Repeat exploitation: New hosts on the local network are exploited by repeating steps 3 and 4. 8. Update C2: Information is sent back to the C2 servers about new infections. 9. Module management: C2 can remotely determine which exploit modules are deployed on infected machines. 10. Self-propagation: The process repeats itself on newly infected hosts, allowing the worm to automatically propagate.
