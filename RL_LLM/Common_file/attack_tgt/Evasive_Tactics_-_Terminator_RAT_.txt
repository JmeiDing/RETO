1. Attackers send a malicious Word document named "103.doc" as a spear-phishing attachment. 2. The document exploits CVE-2012-0158 to drop an installer "DW20.exe". 3. DW20.exe installs itself to %UserProfile%\Microsoft and %AppData%\2019. 4. It changes the registry startup location to point to the %AppData% folder. 5. DW20.exe decrypts a resource to extract sss.exe and configures it as a network relay. 6. sss.exe identifies proxy servers and listens on port 8000 for the malware. 7. After installing, DW20.exe deletes itself so malware runs only after reboot. 8. On reboot, sss.exe connects to C2 domains through identified proxies. 9. sss.exe relays traffic between the malware svchost_.exe and the C2. 10. Encrypted C2 traffic contains system info and a campaign ID. 11. Other malware like WinData and Protux also connect to the same C2 domains. 12. The group tailors malware for targets in ongoing campaigns against Taiwan.
