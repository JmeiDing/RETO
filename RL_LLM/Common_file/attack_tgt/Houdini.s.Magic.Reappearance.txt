1. The attacker sends phishing emails with SFX files containing politically-themed filenames and decoys. 2. The SFX droppers execute decoy documents/videos and drop the Hworm payload in the background. 3. Hworm connects back to the C2 server using a TCP-based command protocol. 4. The implant collects system information and sends it to the C2. 5. The attacker can remotely control infected hosts using Hworm's modules for screengrabs, keylogging etc. 6. Hworm ensures persistence by adding registry run keys or startup tasks. 7. The attacker continually sends commands and receives exfiltrated data from victims over the C2 channel. 8. New versions of Hworm with updated configurations are deployed in successive waves of attacks.
