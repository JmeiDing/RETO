1. TA413 sends phishing emails to Tibetan organizations with a link to download the malicious FriarFox browser extension. 2. The link goes to a fake Flash update page that checks the victim's browser type and Gmail login status. 3. If conditions match, FriarFox is installed and granted permissions to access Gmail and browser data. 4. FriarFox contacts the attacker's server to retrieve the Scanbox malware framework. 5. Scanbox enables keylogging, web tracking, and data exfiltration from the target's system. 6. FriarFox hides its presence and can read, send, forward, and delete emails from the Gmail account. 7. Stolen data is sent back to the attacker's command and control server. 8. Links connect this campaign to previous TA413 activity against Tibetan groups using Royal Road and Sepulcher.
