1. The attackers gain initial access, possibly using compromised AnyDesk credentials. 2. The attackers deploy ransomware over the internal network, likely from a compromised machine. The ransomware executable name is randomly generated and invoked without a BAT file. 3. The ransomware executes on the victim machine, checking for specific arguments. If missing, it displays a fake error message. 4. The ransomware encrypts files using RC4 encryption, overwriting them with encrypted data to make recovery impossible. 5. Ransom notes are left on the infected machines with political messaging. 6. In parallel, the attackers use the wiper malware signed with a stolen certificate to install the embedded raw disk driver. 7. The wiper executes immediately after driver installation to start wiping data using DeviceControl methods. 8. The wiper overwrites data on the disks directly using the driver, destroying files and disks to damage the victim. 9. The stolen certificates allow the malware to bypass security controls and provide the attackers speed and automation to inflict maximum damage across the network.
