 1. The group sends spear-phishing emails with password-protected archives or Google Drive links containing malware installers like Cobalt Strike loaders. 2. If the victim opens the link, they are redirected to download a password-protected archive containing the malware loader. 3. The loader uses encryption and other evasion techniques to decrypt and inject the Cobalt Strike payload into a system process like dllhost.exe. 4. The loader may also use process injection, API hooking, process chain obfuscation, and other techniques to evade detection and persist. 5. For post-exploitation, the group uses custom hacking tools for privilege escalation, credential dumping, and disabling security products. 6. Tools like Mimikatz, PrintNightmare, AVBurner, and ProcBurner are used to carry out these tasks and bypass protections. 7. The tools target Windows kernel functions, drivers, callbacks and more to disable security monitoring and defenses.
