1. Initial access is gained through spear-phishing emails containing malicious ISO images. 2. The ISO image contains an executable file, DLL file, and decoy document (e.g. resume). 3. When executed, the DLL file ensures persistence of the TelePowerBot malware. 4. TelePowerBot is launched via registry keys using event triggered execution when a file with .abcd extension is created. 5. Optionally, the DLL can also deploy information stealers like Cucky or Ctealer to steal browser data. 6. TelePowerBot communicates with the attacker's Telegram bot to receive commands. 7. Reconnaissance is done to collect info about the infected system and network shares. 8. Lateral movement happens by infecting USB devices plugged into compromised machines. 9. Exfiltration occurs via Telegram bots, Dropbox, or email using ZIP archives. 10. Evasion techniques like DLL side-loading and disabling Windows Defender are used. 11. Custom tools like TelePowerBot, KamiKakaBot, Cucky, Ctealer, and ZMsg are leveraged in the attack.
