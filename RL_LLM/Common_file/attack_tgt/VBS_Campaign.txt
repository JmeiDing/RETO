 1. The attack starts with a VBScript that generates a PowerShell script. 2. The PowerShell script creates a weaponized Office document containing macros. 3. When the document is opened, the macro creates and executes a Windows Script File (WSF). 4. The WSF file contacts a command and control server to retrieve obfuscated VBScript payloads. 5. The payloads include reconnaissance functions to fingerprint the system and a pivot function to download and execute shellcode.
