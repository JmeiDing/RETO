1. Send spearphishing document exploiting a vulnerability to drop initial malware. 2. First stage malware resolves APIs, checks process name, and drops signed Symantec binary and launcher DLL. 3. Launcher DLL loads and patches Windows APIs to disable event logging. 4. Dropper writes encrypted shellcode for next stage in Windows event logs. 5. Launcher gathers shellcode from event logs and injects next stage malware into dllhost process. 6. Next stage malware connects to C2 servers for commands. 7. Additional tools like Cobalt Strike and SilentBreak used for reconnaissance and lateral movement. 8. Final RAT payload deployed, often using process injection to avoid detection. 9. RAT exfiltrates data and can download more malware. 10. Infrastructure utilizes VPS services to host C2 and malware.
