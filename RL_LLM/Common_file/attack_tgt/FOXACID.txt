 1. The NSA's TAO group performs reconnaissance on potential targets. 2. Targets are filtered based on vulnerability, then sessions are hijacked via MITM attacks. 3. FOXACID scans the target system and chooses the optimal exploit. 4. Shellcode is injected to deliver the spyware payload. 5. If the exploit succeeds, FOXACID installs persistent malware based on the target's value. 6. Implants like SECONDDATE and Validator enable long-term monitoring and data exfiltration. 7. Wrappers like DireScallop ensure malware persistence even with protections like DeepFreeze. 8. TAO manages FOXACID operations via a web-based Project Tracker interface. 9. Infrastructure consists of regional servers for spam, MITM attacks, and post-exploitation. 10. Custom filters tailor each stage of the attack chain based on reconnaissance data.
