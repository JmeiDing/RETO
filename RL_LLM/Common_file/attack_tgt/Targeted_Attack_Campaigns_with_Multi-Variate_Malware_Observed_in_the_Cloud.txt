1. The attacker sends emails with zipped JavaScript attachments to targeted victims. The filenames resemble the recipient's email address. 2. The JavaScript attachments exploit Windows Script Host to connect and download a malicious payload from the attacker's server. 3. The payload is saved in the %TEMP% directory with a random name. Variants include Adwind RAT, iSpy keylogger, and Locky ransomware. 4. The malicious payload executes on the victim's machine, establishing persistence and disabling antivirus. 5. The payload exfiltrates data like keystrokes and system info back to the attacker's command and control server. 6. The victim syncs the infected file to cloud storage apps, spreading it to additional users. 7. Netskope detects the attack at multiple stages - initial attachment, obfuscated JavaScript, and final payload. 8. Netskope blocks unsanctioned cloud access, scans files remotely, and enforces data policies to protect the cloud environment.
