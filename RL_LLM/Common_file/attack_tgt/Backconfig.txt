 The PDF describes malware campaigns by a threat group called Hangover (aka Neon, Viceroy Tiger, MONSOON) targeting government and military organizations in South Asia. The main malware used is called BackConfig, which has a modular architecture that allows flexible functionality like system reconnaissance, keylogging, and uploading additional payloads. The initial infection is through spearphishing emails containing links to compromised websites hosting weaponized Excel docs. The docs contain macros that, when enabled, install multiple components leading to the BackConfig payload being downloaded and executed. The modular approach makes analysis harder as each component alone may not appear malicious. The report provides details on the evolution of the malware delivery methods over recent years, with the latest techniques using scheduled tasks, BITS jobs, encoded scripts and zipped components to eventually download the BackConfig loader. Indicators of compromise are provided including hashes of delivery documents, payloads, infrastructure and certificates used for signing. Protections available through Palo Alto Networks products are listed at the end. In summary, the PDF provides an in-depth look at the ongoing malware campaigns of the Hangover group against targets in South Asia, focusing on the delivery mechanisms and modular nature of the BackConfig malware.
