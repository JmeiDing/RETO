Here are the key steps of the Bitter attack process described in the PDF: 1. The threat actors distribute spearphishing emails with Office document attachments containing naval/military themes. 2. The documents contain an exploit for the Equation Editor (CVE-2018-0798) that executes shellcode when opened. 3. The shellcode downloads a second stage malware called ZxxZ or MuuyDownloader. 4. ZxxZ gathers system info and fingerprints the infected host then retrieves the final payload from a command server. 5. The final payload is often a remote access trojan (RAT) like the .NET Almond RAT analyzed in the report. 6. Almond RAT establishes command and control communication over port 33638 to exfiltrate data and execute commands. 7. The RAT can gather system info, enumerate files/directories, exfiltrate data, delete files, and more. 8. Infrastructure analysis reveals the malware stages are hosted on various compromised servers and web hosting providers. 9. The threat actors continually modify their tools and infrastructure to avoid detections as the campaign continues.
