1. The intrusion began with the Carbanak group exploiting CVE-2017-5638, a vulnerability in Apache Struts, to gain an initial foothold with a high level of privilege. 2. The attackers quickly obtained administrative access in the client's Linux environment. 3. The group utilized a mix of custom and open source tools for ingress, lateral movement, log cleanup, credential harvesting, and internal reconnaissance. The tools were carefully chosen to be cross-platform between Linux and Windows environments. 4. The attackers operated undetected in the client's environment for 35 days before being discovered. 5. They traversed over 150 systems in the client's complex and heterogeneous environment during this dwell time. 6. The Carbanak group adapted their techniques and ingress methods to evade detection and remediation efforts once discovered. 7. RSA's incident response team was able to fully contain the intrusion and remediate the client's environment within 9 days after discovery. 8. Rapid detection and response succeeded due to the client's investment in visibility, skilled personnel, incident response methodologies, and trusted third party relationships.
