1. Attacker compromises an internet-facing enterprise server. 2. Attacker uploads a web shell script containing backdoor functionality, saving it with an extension like ASP, ASPX, PHP, JSP, or CFM. 3. The web shell is hosted on the compromised server, often in a web directory like wwwroot, Apache, or ColdFusion folders. 4. The attacker can now remotely access the victim server through the backdoor in the web shell to perform further malicious actions. 5. The attacker blends the web shell in among thousands of existing legitimate scripts. 6. Defenders use file stacking to identify the web shell based on anomalous creation time or file path compared to other scripts.
