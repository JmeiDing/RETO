1. The threat actor sends phishing emails with RAR archive attachments containing decoy documents. The RAR archives contain hidden folders with malware. 2. If the recipient opens the RAR archive, they see a Windows shortcut file masquerading as the decoy document. 3. If the shortcut is clicked, it executes a legitimate binary file contained in the hidden folders in the RAR archive. 4. The hidden folders also contain a malicious DLL and encrypted PlugX payload. 5. The legitimate binary is vulnerable to DLL hijacking. When executed, it loads the malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one. 6. The malicious DLL decrypts and executes the PlugX payload. 7. PlugX drops a decoy document and copies itself to the ProgramData directory. It sets a Run registry key for persistence. 8. PlugX executes the copied legitimate binary with a command line argument to check if it is executing in a debugger. 9. PlugX decodes its encrypted configuration and contacts its C2 server for further instructions. 10. The C2 server can send commands to download additional plugins and exfiltrate data from the compromised system.
