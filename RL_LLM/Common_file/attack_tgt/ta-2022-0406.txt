1. The attacker sends spear-phishing emails with weaponized attachments to targets in the Indian power sector. 2. Malicious documents or links download and install malware like the ShadowPad backdoor. 3. ShadowPad beacons to compromised DVR/IP camera systems worldwide used as command and control servers. 4. The Fast Reverse Proxy tool provides additional protocol tunneling and obfuscation capabilities. 5. After establishing a foothold, the attacker conducts internal reconnaissance and credential harvesting. 6. Credentials are used alongside tools like RDP for lateral movement across the network. 7. Ongoing access to critical internal systems is maintained, likely for capability development and pre-positioning. 8. While unauthorized access to industrial control systems has not been observed, it remains a possibility. 9. Infrastructure is fluid with new compromised systems regularly added to better evade detections.
