1. The attacker sends a spear-phishing email with a malicious Microsoft Word document attachment. 2. The document contains macros that execute when the victim enables content. The macros drop malware components using DLL sideloading. 3. Alternatively, the document contains the DOWNIISSA downloader shellcode embedded in VBA code. When macros are enabled, this shellcode is injected into the Word process. 4. DOWNIISSA connects to a command and control server to download the LODEINFO backdoor. 5. For attacks using self-extracting archives, the SFX file is sent via spear-phishing. It pretends to contain a video but drops malware. 6. When the SFX is opened, it extracts DLLs and executables to staging folders and executes them to deploy LODEINFO using DLL sideloading. 7. In some cases, the SFX also extracts an additional blob file containing the encrypted backdoor shellcode. 8. The downloaded LODEINFO backdoor provides the attacker remote access and enables further exploitation. 9. New versions of LODEINFO and downloaders like DOWNIISSA are continuously developed to evade detection.
