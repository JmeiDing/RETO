1. The attacker sends a spear phishing email with a malicious PDF attachment. The PDF is made to look like an aviation-related document such as an e-ticket. 2. When the user opens the PDF attachment, it exploits a vulnerability like CVE-2011-0611. 3. The exploit installs the Elirks malware on the system. 4. Elirks then retrieves its C2 server address from accounts set up on predetermined microblog/social media services. 5. Elirks can then steal information from the compromised system.
