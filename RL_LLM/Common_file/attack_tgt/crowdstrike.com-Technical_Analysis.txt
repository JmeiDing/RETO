 1. StellarParticle gained an understanding of the Orion software build process and chain before developing the SUNSPOT malware. 2. The SUNSPOT malware was created specifically to target the Orion build process and inject the SUNBURST backdoor. 3. SUNSPOT was persisted on infected systems using a scheduled task set to execute at boot time. 4. SUNSPOT monitored running processes looking for MsBuild.exe, which is part of the Orion build tools. 5. When an Orion build process was detected, SUNSPOT extracted the Visual Studio solution directory from the process's command line arguments. 6. SUNSPOT located the InventoryManager.cs source code file within the Orion solution directory. 7. The original InventoryManager.cs file was backed up and replaced with a malicious version containing the SUNBURST backdoor code. 8. The tampered InventoryManager.cs file was compiled as part of the Orion build, inserting SUNBURST into the final binaries. 9. After the build completed, SUNSPOT restored the original InventoryManager.cs file to avoid detection. 10. The resulting backdoored Orion software was distributed to SolarWinds customers in software updates. 11. When executed, the backdoored Orion software would install SUNBURST on systems.
