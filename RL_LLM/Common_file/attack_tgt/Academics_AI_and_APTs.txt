 1. State-sponsored groups recruit talent from universities conducting cutting-edge AI and cybersecurity research. 2. The groups likely provide funding or data to guide the academic research toward operational needs. 3. Researchers develop techniques for exploiting systems, evading detection, discovering vulnerabilities, etc. 4. Promising research is transitioned by the hacking groups into new tradecraft and operational capabilities. 5. The groups employ the new AI/ML techniques in cyber operations for espionage, surveillance, or sabotage. 6. Rapid experimentation and implementation accelerates the development cycle from lab to operations.
