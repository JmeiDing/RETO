1. TA402 sends spear phishing emails containing links to targets in the Middle East region. 2. The phishing links use geofencing and redirects to evade detection. 3. If the target's IP is in the Middle East, they are redirected to an actor-controlled domain or Dropbox URL to download a RAR file. 4. The RAR file contains the NimbleMamba malware and sometimes the BrittleBush trojan. 5. NimbleMamba executes on the victim's system and communicates with attacker-controlled Dropbox accounts for command and control. 6. NimbleMamba exfiltrates data like screenshots and system info back to the attacker via the Dropbox API. 7. The BrittleBush trojan receives commands from a C2 server and may provide additional capabilities. 8. TA402 continuously updates their malware, infrastructure, and attack tactics to evade detection.
