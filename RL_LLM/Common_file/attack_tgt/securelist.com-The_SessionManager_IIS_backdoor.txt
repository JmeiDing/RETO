1. The threat actor exploits ProxyLogon or similar vulnerabilities to compromise Microsoft Exchange servers. 2. A web shell is uploaded on the compromised Exchange server to allow remote access. 3. Tools like Mimikatz and memory dump utilities are downloaded to do reconnaissance and collect credentials. 4. The SessionManager IIS module backdoor is deployed on the server by placing the DLL in a folder that will load it into IIS. 5. SessionManager hooks into IIS's HTTP processing to intercept requests and run commands from the operators. 6. The attackers send HTTP requests with specially crafted cookies to trigger actions in SessionManager. 7. Commands allow the attackers to further explore the network, move laterally, dump credentials, etc. 8. Additional backdoors and tools may be downloaded via SessionManager to maintain persistent access. 9. The compromised server is leveraged for espionage activities, data exfiltration, and lateral movement. 10.
