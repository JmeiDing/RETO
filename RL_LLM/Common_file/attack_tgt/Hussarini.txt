1. The attacker distributes a malicious Microsoft Word document named "Draft PH-US Dialogue on Cyber Security.doc" that exploits CVE-2017-11882. 2. If the victim opens the document, it drops two files Outllib.dll and OutExtra.exe in the %Temp% directory. 3. OutExtra.exe is made to load the DLL file Outllib.dll which is actually the Hussarini malware. This uses a DLL hijacking technique to bypass security products. 4. Hussarini generates a unique ServerID and connects to a command and control server at publicdfaph.publicvm.com. 5. It sends system information to the C&C and can receive commands like downloading additional malware components. 6. Hussarini can also launch a remote shell on the victim machine to execute commands sent by the attacker. 7. The document name and other clues suggest the attack targets the Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs.
