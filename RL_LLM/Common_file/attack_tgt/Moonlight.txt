1. The attackers send emails with attachments or links to files that appear legitimate but have a .exe extension. 2. The attachments or links contain themes of interest to potential Middle Eastern victims as a form of social engineering. 3. If opened, the files install the H-Worm malware as a first stage backdoor. 4. The H-Worm malware is delivered via shortened URLs or domains impersonating Middle Eastern media. 5. Later stages use the installed H-Worm access to deliver additional malware like the njRat Remote Access Trojan. 6. njRat provides persistent access and control over the compromised system. 7. The command and control infrastructure uses dynamic domains hosted on home internet connections in the West Bank. 8. Over 200 varied malware samples were linked to the simple C2 infrastructure. 9. Earlier attacks were opportunistic, later attacks more targeted against specific groups/individuals. 10. The attacks rely on basic scripts and obfuscation rather than advanced exploits. 11. The motivations appear to be politically driven espionage rather than financial. 12. The tools and targets share connections with the Gaza Hacker Team. 13. Despite low sophistication, these attacks enable spying and could enable loss of life.
