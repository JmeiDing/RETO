1. The attackers distribute a Microsoft Word document containing macros to victims in Ukraine. 2. If the victim enables macros, a malicious executable payload is dropped to disk and executed. 3. The dropped payload installs a BlackEnergy trojan that connects to a command and control server. 4. The BlackEnergy trojan sends system information about the infected machine to the C2. 5. The C2 can send commands back to the trojan on the victim's system. 6. Commands could include further malware downloads, data exfiltration, or destructive actions like disk wiping. 7. The attackers likely utilize the access for espionage against industrial control systems and critical infrastructure in Ukraine. 8. The macro-based distribution continues the trend of using Office documents to initially deliver BlackEnergy malware in this ongoing campaign.
