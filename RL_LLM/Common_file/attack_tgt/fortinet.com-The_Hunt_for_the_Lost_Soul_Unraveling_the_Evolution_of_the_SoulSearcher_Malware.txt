 1. The earliest versions of the malware are droppers that decrypt and install a malicious backdoor module. 2. The backdoor connects to a command and control server to receive commands, which include remote shell, file transfers, and proxy capabilities. 3. By 2018, a more advanced loader called SoulSearcher is deployed, which stores encrypted payloads in the registry and loads them in memory without writing them to disk. 4. SoulSearcher variants parse complex XML or semicolon-separated configurations that determine what modules to load and their capabilities. 5. Modules loaded by SoulSearcher include backdoors, keyloggers, proxy tools, and utilities that can retrieve additional payloads. 6. The backdoors communicate with command servers using faked HTTP requests to receive commands and additional modules. Loaded modules are reflectively executed in memory. 7. The malware gathers system information, logs keystrokes, and exfiltrates data to remote servers controlled by the threat actor. 8. Components use custom encryption, obfuscation, modularity, and other techniques to evade detection. The code quality and tradecraft improve over time. 9. The modular framework enables the threat actor to deliver multiple capabilities tailored to individual targets.
