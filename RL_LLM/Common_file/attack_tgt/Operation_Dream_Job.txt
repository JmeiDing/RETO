 1. Lazarus group creates fake LinkedIn profiles impersonating recruiters at defense/aerospace companies. 2. The profiles connect with and send messages to employees at target companies about an appealing job opportunity. 3. If the target shows interest, the fake recruiter sends them a link to download a malicious document containing malware. 4. The malware executes through multiple stages: Stage 1: Weaponized PDF, DOC, or DOTM file exploits the system to download the initial Trojan. Stage 2: Trojan drops a LNK file for persistence and a DLL for next-stage delivery. Stage 3: DLL drops the custom Lazarus RAT malware called DRATzarus.Stage 4: DRATzarus pulls additional tools from the C2 server depending on the target environment. 5. Final payloads allow Lazarus to remotely control the system for espionage and potential financial theft. 6. Meanwhile, the fake LinkedIn accounts are deleted to remove traces of the attack.
