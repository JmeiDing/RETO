1. The attackers compromise ad servers and embed malicious ads on legitimate websites. 2. The ads redirect visitors to the Greenflash Sundown exploit kit landing page. 3. The exploit kit employs evasion techniques to fingerprint the victim's system profile. 4. If the system is deemed a target, the kit exploits vulnerabilities in browsers/plugins like Flash. 5. Exploits deliver an encrypted payload to the visiting system. 6. The payload decrypts itself using a flawed cryptographic technique. 7. The decrypted payload turns out to be a Monero cryptocurrency miner. 8. The miner module establishes persistence and communicates with attacker infrastructure. 9. The attackers mine cryptocurrency utilizing the infected host system resources.
