 1. A trojanized VGCA software installer is distributed containing the malware eToken.exe and RegistereToken.exe. 2. When the installer is run, a custom action executes RegistereToken.exe which then executes eToken.exe. 3. eToken.exe extracts and executes the backdoor DLL smanager_ssl.dll from an embedded .cab file. 4. eToken.exe creates scheduled tasks, installs as a service, and configures command and control communication. 5. The backdoor smanager_ssl.dll provides remote access to compromise the system. 6. The supply chain of legitimate VGCA software is leveraged to distribute the malware to targets in Vietnam.
