 1. The attacker sends a phishing email or leverages an exploit to deliver the H-W0rm malware to victims. 2. H-W0rm establishes command and control communication with the attacker's server. 3. The implant sends system information like hardware IDs, OS version, etc. to the C2. 4. The attacker utilizes H-W0rm's modules to perform actions like keylogging, screen captures, password theft, file exfiltration etc. on the infected host. 5. H-W0rm may spread laterally using capabilities like USB infection. 6. Collected data from victims is exfiltrated to the attacker over the C2 channel. 7. The attacker can continually send commands and updates to infected hosts.
