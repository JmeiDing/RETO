 1. In June 2015, new malware samples were discovered that had similarities to the 2013 Dark Seoul/Operation Troy malware. 2. The new malware, called TDrop2, was delivered via trojanized installation files for legitimate software. 3. When executed, TDrop2 installs the legitimate software and infects the system. 4. TDrop2 uses process hollowing to execute malicious code from a legitimate system process. 5. The malware retrieves an encrypted payload disguised as an image file. 6. The payload is decrypted and injected into another hollowed system process. 7. The payload can receive encrypted commands from the attacker including reconnaissance and downloading more malware. 8. A custom encryption and base64 encoding algorithm is used for command and control. 9. Compromised servers in South Korea and Europe are used for command and control. 10. The targeting focused on the transportation and logistics sector in Europe. 11. Tactics and malware functionality strongly resemble the Dark Seoul tools from 2013. 12. The threat actor groups behind Dark Seoul are suspected to have reopened cyber espionage activities with modified infrastructure.
