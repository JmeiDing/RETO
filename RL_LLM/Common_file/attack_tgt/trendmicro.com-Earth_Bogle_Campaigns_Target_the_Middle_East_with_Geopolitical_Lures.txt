 1. A malicious CAB file containing an obfuscated VBS script is distributed via social media, file sharing, or phishing emails. 2. The VBS script retrieves and executes a PowerShell payload from a compromised domain. 3. The PowerShell payload kills .NET processes and injects the NjRAT malware into aspnet_compiler.exe. 4. NjRAT connects to its command and control server to receive commands for remote access, data exfiltration, and other malicious activities. 5. Persistence is achieved by adding folders to the system startup keys.
