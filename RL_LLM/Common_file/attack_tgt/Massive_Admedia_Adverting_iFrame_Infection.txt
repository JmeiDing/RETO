1. The malware encrypts malicious JavaScript code with 32-digit hex comments containing an MD5 hash at the beginning and end. 2. The encrypted code decrypts to an iframe that loads ads/tracking content from various recently registered domains hosted on DigitalOcean servers. 3. The malware injects the encrypted code into .js files on the WordPress site. 4. The malware sets a cookie so the iframe only loads for first-time visitors. 5. The malware uploads multiple backdoors to reinfect the site after cleanup. 6. The frequent malware updates and self-spreading behavior leads to constant reinfections across sites hosted on the same account.
