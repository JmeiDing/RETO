1. The malware dropper executes and downloads encrypted payloads. 2. The dropper decrypts payloads using an RC5 key derived from the victim system's volume serial number. This ensures the payload only runs on the intended target. 3. The decrypted payload is a next-stage backdoor or module. 4. The LOWKEY backdoor passively listens on ports 53 or 80 for commands. 5. LOWKEY supports commands for remote shell, file transfer, process control, etc. 6. The TCP variant uses a rootkit to intercept and forward traffic to itself for covert communication. 7. Operators can use the backdoor for lateral movement and remote control of the victim.
