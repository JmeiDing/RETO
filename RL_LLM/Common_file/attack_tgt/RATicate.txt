1. The threat actor distributed NSIS installers containing junk files and a custom loader via malspam campaigns. 2. When executed, the installer would drop the custom loader DLL and encrypted payload data. 3. The loader would call an export function to decrypt and execute shellcode from its resources. 4. The shellcode read the encrypted data and decrypted a second stage shellcode and loader DLL. 5. The second stage shellcode reflected the second loader into memory. 6. The second loader decrypted more shellcode and strings, eventually decrypting the final malware payload. 7. The final shellcode injected the malware payload into a new process using a code injection technique. 8. The malware payload would then connect to command and control servers operated by the threat actor.
