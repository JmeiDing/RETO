 1. In Turkey, Sandvine devices inject HTTP redirects when users attempt to download certain Windows programs from legitimate vendor sites like Avast and CCleaner. 2.

In Egypt, Sandvine devices hijack connections by injecting redirects to ads and cryptocurrency mining scripts either en masse (spray mode) or for specific sites/resources (trickle mode). 4. The redirects rely on targets visiting sites without HTTPS enabled, so their traffic can be tampered with. 5. PacketLogic's built-in features for injecting redirects and blocking sites are used to carry out the attacks.
