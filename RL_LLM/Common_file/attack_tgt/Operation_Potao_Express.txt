 1. Initial infection vectors include spear-phishing emails, SMS messages, compromised websites, and USB drives spreading the malware. 2. The first-stage dropper executes and drops the main Potao DLL malware. 3. The DLL injects into explorer.exe and other processes like browsers. 4. The injected DLL contacts the C&C server to exchange encryption keys. 5. The C&C server sends commands to perform actions like downloading plugins. 6. Plugins are downloaded that have spying functions like keylogging, stealing files, etc. 7. The plugins exfiltrate data from the infected system back to the C&C server.
