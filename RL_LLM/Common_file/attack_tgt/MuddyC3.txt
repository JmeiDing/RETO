1. MuddyWater sends spear-phishing emails with document attachments containing malicious macros. 2. If the victim enables macros, the document reaches out to the MuddyC3 C2 server. 3. MuddyC3 allows the operator to deliver a next stage payload such as sct, hta, PowerShell. 4. The next stage payload further compromises the system and allows maintaining persistence. 5. MuddyC3 enables uploading and downloading files, collecting system info, and using modules. 6. The operator can leverage the compromised system for additional attacks, data exfiltration, etc.
