1. Attackers compromise game developers and insert backdoors into game builds. 2. The backdoors are embedded in the game executables and decrypted early in execution. 3. The payload collects system info and connects to attacker C2 servers impersonating gaming companies. 4. The C2 sends commands to download additional malware like Winnti. 5. The compromised games distribute the backdoors to victims when they install the games. 6. Victims' systems get infected with the backdoor and C2 when they run the games. 7. The attackers gain access to execute commands and distribute malware further on the victim systems.
