 1. Spearphishing emails containing malware are sent to mid to senior level executives at target companies. 2. The emails contain attachments disguised as PDFs that are actually droppers/installers for the Mirage malware. 3. When executed, Mirage copies itself to system folders, creates registry keys for persistence, and deletes the original dropper file. 4. Mirage phones home to C2 servers, sending encoded system information like MAC address, CPU details, usernames etc. 5. If the C2 server receives the request, it responds with a simple confirmation message. 6. Infected systems then continue to send regular check-in updates to the C2 server with minimal info like MAC address. 7. Mirage receives and executes further commands from the C2 server. 8. This allows the threat actors to steal intellectual property, secrets, and sensitive information from the infected target companies.
