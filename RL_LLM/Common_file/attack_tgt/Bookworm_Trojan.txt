1. The attacker exploits a Telerik UI vulnerability or sideloads a trojanized Kaspersky/Microsoft binary to gain initial access. 2. The exploited process writes Bookworm files like Loader.dll and shellcode to disk. 3. The Loader.dll sideloads and decrypts the shellcode from a README.txt file. 4. The shellcode loads the main Bookworm module Leader.dll into memory. 5. Leader installs Bookworm by creating new files and registry keys for persistence. 6. Bookworm establishes command and control communications to receives commands. 7. The built-in keylogger module captures keystrokes and clipboard contents and encrypts them before exfiltration. 8. Bookworm can receive additional modules from the C2 server and dynamically load them into memory. 9. Any additional modules enable further capabilities as determined by the threat actor. 10. Bookworm maintains access through registry-based persistence, and continues communicating with the C2 server.
