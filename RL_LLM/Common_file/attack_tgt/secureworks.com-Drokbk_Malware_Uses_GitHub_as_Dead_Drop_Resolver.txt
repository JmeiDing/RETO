1. Initial Compromise - Threat actors compromise VMware Horizon server using Log4j vulnerabilities. 2. Deploy Malware - Drokbk dropper and payload deployed on compromised server. - Dropper extracts Drokbk.zip archive hosting malware. 3. Install Malware - Dropper installs payload as SessionService.exe service for persistence. - Uses dead drop resolving technique to determine C2 server from GitHub. 4. Establish C2 - Payload sends initial beacon to C2 containing hostname and time. 5. Additional Actions - Malware creates temporary files locally. - No additional payloads or commands received from C2 during analysis. 6. Maintain Persistence - Malware configured to continue beaconing to C2 domains/IPs for ongoing access. - Threat actors update C2 info in GitHub README frequently.
