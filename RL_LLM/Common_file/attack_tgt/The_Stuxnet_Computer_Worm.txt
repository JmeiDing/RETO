 1. Spread initially via infected USB drives, not through the internet. 2. Infects the Windows-based control system made by Siemens that monitors industrial equipment. 3. Remains hidden on the system, periodically checking normal frequencies of the equipment. 4. Reprograms the control system to give unexpected commands to the industrial equipment at a time when normal frequencies indicate the system is operating. 5. Causes the equipment to perform erratically or shutdown, leading to failures. 6. Spreads through networks and USB drives to additional systems after initial infection.
