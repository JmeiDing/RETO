1. FiveSys spreads through infected driver files that infiltrate target systems. 2. It installs itself in the Windows kernel after bypassing protections using its valid Microsoft signature. 3. The rootkit intercepts web traffic and redirects it to attacker-controlled servers. 4. It leverages proxy auto-config scripts and fake root certificates to proxy and decrypt HTTPS connections. 5. FiveSys harvests credentials and other sensitive data from the intercepted communications. 6. It blocks and blacklists competing malware trying to infect the same systems. 7. The rootkit receives updates from command and control servers to evolve its capabilities. 8. Ultimately, FiveSys aims to enable espionage, data theft, and potential ransomware deployment on compromised machines.
