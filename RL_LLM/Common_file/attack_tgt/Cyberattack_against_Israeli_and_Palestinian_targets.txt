1. The attacker sends emails with malicious attachments to targets. The attachments are documents such as Word docs that have been crafted with specific themes and titles to interest the recipients. 2. If the recipient opens the attachment, it executes malware - typically a remote access trojan like XtremeRat. The malware is often hidden inside a nested archive to avoid detection. 3. The malware then connects to command and control (C2) servers controlled by the attacker. 4. Many of the malware samples use the same C2 domains and IP addresses, suggesting coordination by a single threat actor. 5. The C2 infrastructure was originally located in IP ranges belonging to Palestinian ISPs. 6. More recently, the C2 servers have shifted to US-based hosting providers, presumably to avoid detection. 7. The attacker can use the malware to gain remote access, conduct surveillance, and steal data from infected machines. 8. The attacks initially targeted Palestinian organizations but shifted focus to Israeli targets around mid-2012. 9. The attacks have been ongoing for at least a year at the time of the report, indicating an advanced, persistent threat. 10. The goal appears to be cyberespionage and surveillance related to regional political issues.
