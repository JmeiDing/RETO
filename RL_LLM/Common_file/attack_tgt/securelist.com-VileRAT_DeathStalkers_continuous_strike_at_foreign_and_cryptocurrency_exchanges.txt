1. DeathStalker operators research potential targets in the cryptocurrency and foreign exchange space. 2. Spearphishing emails are sent to targets containing weaponized Word docs or Google Drive links. 3. The docs fetch a macro-enabled DOTM file that profiles the system and drops VileDropper malware. 4. VileDropper executes VileLoader, a custom .NET binary loader. 5. VileLoader connects to a C2 server to download the VileRAT Python RAT. 6. VileRAT provides remote access, allowing the operators to explore the network and systems. 7. The operators use VileRAT's capabilities like command execution, keylogging, and credential theft to steal data. 8. VileRAT is used to maintain persistent access on the targets for monitoring and theft. 9. The operators likely leverage the access to steal cryptocurrency or manipulate transactions for profit. 10. VileRAT, VileLoader, and other stages are continuously updated to avoid detection during the prolonged attacks.
