Okay, here are the key steps in the attack process based on the PDF: 1. COZY BEAR sent spearphishing emails with malware (SeaDaddy) to gain initial access to DNC network in summer 2015. 2. SeaDaddy malware communicated with C2 servers using HTTPS after execution on victim systems. 3. Encrypted powershell scripts were executed via WMI persistence to download additional modules. 4. Modules were decrypted in memory and executed for further reconnaissance and lateral movement. 5. FANCY BEAR separately breached DNC in April 2016 also via phishing using X-Agent and X-Tunnel tools. 6. X-Agent and X-Tunnel enabled remote command execution, file transfers, and keylogging on compromised systems. 7. MimiKatz was used by FANCY BEAR to dump credentials from memory for lateral movement. 8. Both groups exfiltrated files and data from DNC network back to their infrastructure. 9. They also cleaned up logs and reset timestamps to avoid detection.
