 1. LightBasin conducts external reconnaissance against GPRS network components like external DNS servers. 2. The group uses password spraying to gain initial SSH access to externally facing systems. 3. Custom malware like Slapstick and PingPong are deployed to establish persistence and pivot internally. 4. LightBasin abuses trust between telecom companies to pivot across networks via compromised hosts. 5. Tools like SIGTRANslator are used to intercept and parse metadata of interest. 6. Scanning tools like CordScan fingerprint and extract subscriber data from mobile networks. 7. Sgsnemu is leveraged to emulate GSM infrastructure for disguised C2 communications. 8. Collected data is exfiltrated back to LightBasin infrastructure for further analysis. 9. Additional reconnaissance occurs to map out telecom network topology and identify further systems of interest. 10. Steps 2-9 are repeated to compromise additional telecom providers and harvest data.
