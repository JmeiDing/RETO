1. Gorgon Group sends phishing emails with weaponized Office documents containing macros. 2. If the user enables macros, the documents download a .NET trojan payload. 3. The .NET trojan downloads another injector trojan and extracts it. 4. The injector trojan hollows out a process like cvtres.exe and injects the next stage payload. 5. The injected payload downloads the final remote access trojan (RAT) like NanoCoreRAT. 6. The RAT connects to its command and control server to enable remote access. 7. Gorgon Group leverages the compromised access for cybercrime or targeted surveillance.
