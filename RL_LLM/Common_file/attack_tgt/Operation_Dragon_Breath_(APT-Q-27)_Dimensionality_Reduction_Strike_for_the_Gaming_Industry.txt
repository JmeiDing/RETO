 1. The hacker group compromises Telegram installer packages and embeds malware. 2. The malicious Telegram installer is distributed via watering hole sites targeting victims. 3. Victims download and run the fake Telegram installer. 4. The installer executes stealthy persistence using registry modifications and shortcut hijacking. 5. When the infected shortcut is launched, it decrypts and executes info-stealing malware from the registry. 6. The malware collects sensitive data like passwords and crypto wallet information and exfiltrates it to the attacker's command and control servers. So in summary, it involves compromising legitimate software, distributing it via watering holes, installing stealthy persistence, and executing data-stealing malware triggered by a hijacked shortcut.
