 1. Initial Access - The attack starts with a spear phishing email containing a weaponized Word document. The document has hidden payloads in its properties. 2. Execution - When the document is opened, a macro extracts the payloads and writes them to the filesystem as HexINI loader and an encoded shellcode INI file. 3. Defense Evasion - The HexINI loader decodes the shellcode from the INI file and injects it into a new svchost.exe process using process injection techniques. 4. Command and Control - The injected shellcode is a beacon that connects to a C2 server to receive additional commands. 5. Persistence - The beacon repeatedly connects to the C2 every 7899 ms to receive updated instructions. 6. Lateral Movement - The C2 server can send new payloads and tools to the beacon for further exploitation once access is gained. 7. Exfiltration - As an espionage campaign, the likely goal is data exfiltration of sensitive documents from the compromised target. 8. Reconnaissance - The C2 server was found to be running an asset reconnaissance tool called ARL to discover additional systems and attack surfaces.
