1. BlueNoroff operators research and identify potential cryptocurrency targets by studying successful startups and compiling lists of employees and topics of interest. 2. The attackers impersonate trusted entities like investors, partners, or colleagues of the target through compromised social media accounts or email spoofing. 3. Weaponized documents are sent to the target purporting to be contracts, presentations, pitch decks, etc. These docs contain exploits or macros to download malware. 4. The initial malware fingerprints the victim's system and sends info back to the C2 server. More malware like Powershell scripts and backdoors are downloaded. 5. The backdoor malware allows the attackers to begin interacting with the infected system to collect credentials, monitor activities, and move laterally. 6. Once the attackers have sufficient access, they monitor the victim's cryptocurrency transactions. When large transfers are made, they inject code into wallet apps to redirect transactions. 7. The injected code secretly modifies the recipient address and amount sent to steal the funds. The user still confirms the transaction on their end without realizing. 8. Alternatively, the hackers wait until the victim has accumulated large cryptocurrency holdings. They then drain the entire wallet in one fraudulent transaction. 9. The stolen cryptocurrency is filtered through various wallets and exchanges by the attackers to obscure the money trail before ultimately cashing out.
