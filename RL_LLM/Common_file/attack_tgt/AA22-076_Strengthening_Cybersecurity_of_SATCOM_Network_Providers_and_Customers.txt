 1. Threat actors gain access to SATCOM provider networks through exploiting remote access tools, stolen credentials, or trust relationships. 2. They move laterally within the SATCOM network, escalating privileges and compromising critical systems. 3. The threat actors could then pivot from the provider's network into customer environments that rely on the SATCOM services. 4. They perform actions like exfiltrating data from customers, disrupting services, or sabotaging systems that depend on the SATCOM connectivity. 5. Monitoring for unauthorized tools, unexpected traffic, and other anomalies could detect the intrusions into SATCOM networks. 6. Customers can protect themselves by encrypting traffic, patching systems, monitoring logs, and having continuity plans.
