The attackers prepared malicious update files, signed them with the stolen certificate, and uploaded them to their server. 3. The attackers compromised the update server of the remote support solutions provider. 4. The compromised update server was configured to receive the malicious update file from the attacker's server if the client IP was in the targeted range. 5.
