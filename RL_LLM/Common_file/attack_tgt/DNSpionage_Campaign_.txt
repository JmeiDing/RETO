 1. The attacker creates fake job recruitment websites and malicious Office documents containing macros. 2. The malicious Office documents are distributed via emails or other means to targets in Lebanon and UAE. 3. Victims open the Office documents, triggering the macro execution. 4. The macro installs the DNSpionage remote access trojan on the compromised system. 5. DNSpionage establishes command and control channels using HTTP and DNS to communicate with attacker infrastructure. 6. The attacker sends commands to the infected machines to perform reconnaissance and exfiltrate data. 7. DNSpionage logs keystrokes and command output, sending the information back to the attacker. 8. The attacker redirects DNS records for government and private company domains to an IP address they control. 9. Let's Encrypt certificates are generated for the redirected domains to avoid detection. 10. Traffic intended for the hijacked domains is intercepted by the attacker via the rogue IP address. 11. The attacker can monitor and manipulate intercepted web, email, VPN and other service traffic bound for the target organizations.
