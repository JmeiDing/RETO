1. Initial Infection Vector. The group gains initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities or guessing default credentials to upload a web shell on the target network. 2. Lateral Movement . The group uses publicly available tools like Mimikatz, SysInternals, Nbtscan, etc. for lateral movement within the compromised network. - They steal credentials with Mimikatz and DCSync to obtain domain admin privileges. 3. Deploying Malware. Custom malware like Calypso RAT, PlugX, and Byeby trojan are deployed on hosts. 4. Command and Control. The malware establishes command and control channels to receive commands and exfiltrate data. - This is done via TCP, SSL, HTTP headers, configuration strings, etc. based on the variant. 5. Loading Modules. Additional modules can be loaded by the malware for extra functions like keylogging, screenshots, remote shell, etc. 6. Exfiltration. Finally, the confidential data is exfiltrated from the victim network back to the attacker's servers. 7. Maintaining Persistence. Malware achieves persistence using registry run keys, scheduled tasks, hidden files and more.
