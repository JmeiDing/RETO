1. The attackers sent spear-phishing emails containing malicious attachments to target users at organizations. 2. When the attachment was opened, it executed a dropper program on the endpoint. 3. The dropper installed the first stage of the Aurora malware, creating registry keys during installation. 4. The first stage malware installed the second stage, creating more registry keys. 5. The installed malware communicated over the internet to attacker command and control servers. 6. The malware took steps to protect and obscure itself from detection and analysis. 7. Triumfant's real-time scanning detected the suspicious registry keys created during installation. 8. Triumfant analyzed the endpoint, identified anomalies indicative of malware, and determined the malware was communicating over the internet. 9. Triumfant could have created recognition filters to search for other infected machines based on the analysis. 10. For remediation, Triumfant would have surgically restored altered files, configurations, registry keys, etc. to remove the malware and return the endpoint to pre-infection state.
