 1. 3ve.1 infected computers with malware like Miuref/Boaxxe to acquire residential proxy IPs. 2. 3ve.2 infected 700,000+ computers via malvertising campaigns that installed the Kovter malware. 3. The malware created hidden desktops and browsers to conceal fraudulent ad activity. 4. The malware mimicked human behavior like mouse movements and fake clicks to avoid detection. 5. The infected bots connected to command and control servers to receive instructions. 6. The instructions directed the bots to visit specific spoofed sites and ads set up by 3ve. 7. The bots loaded the spoofed sites/ads to generate fake ad bid requests to sell counterfeit inventory. 8. The infrastructure disrupted real requests and redirected them to 3ve's counterfeit domains. 9. Anti-forensics and tag evasion blocked security scanning tools and prevented detection. 10. Frequent IP rotation and domain spoofing hid the botnet infrastructure from being tracked.
