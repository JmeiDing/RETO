1. LuckyMouse compromises the Mimi messaging application and backdoors the MacOS version. 2. The backdoored Mimi app is distributed through unknown means (possibly social engineering) to targets. 3. Users install and launch the Mimi app on their MacOS systems. 4. The backdoored Mimi app downloads the RShell implant from a LuckyMouse C2 server. 5. RShell is installed to the temp directory, set as executable, and executed. 6. RShell connects to LuckyMouse C2 infrastructure to receive commands. 7. LuckyMouse operators send commands to gather system info and interact with the filesystem. 8. Data is exfiltrated from the compromised system back to LuckyMouse. 9. LuckyMouse leverages the compromised access to move laterally and compromise additional systems/data.
