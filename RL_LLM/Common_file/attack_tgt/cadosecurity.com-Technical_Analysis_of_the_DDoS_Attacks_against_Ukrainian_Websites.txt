1. The attackers identified vulnerable internet-connected devices like IP cameras to infect with Katana malware and build a botnet. 2. They started exploiting devices and uploading Katana malware samples on February 13th to establish botnet infrastructure. 3. The botnet malware communicates with a command and control server on IP 5.182.211.5 for instructions. 4. On February 15-16, the command server instructs the botnet to flood Ukrainian bank, government, and military websites with junk traffic, launching the DDoS attack. 5. In conjunction with the DDoS, the attackers also launched attacks on DNS servers, BGP hijacking against targeted networks, and fake SMS messages. 6. The combination of attacks sought to overwhelm infrastructure and sow panic among the Ukrainian population. 7. Targeted websites experienced spikes in traffic but were restored within hours, limiting the overall impact. 8. The botnet infrastructure remains in place and could be utilized for future attacks if commanded by the control server.
