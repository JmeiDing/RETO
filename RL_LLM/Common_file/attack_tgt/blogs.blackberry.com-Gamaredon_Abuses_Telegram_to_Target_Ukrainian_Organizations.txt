1. Gamaredon sends weaponized documents, often in Ukrainian, to targets via spearphishing. 2. If the victim opens the document, an obfuscated VBA macro fetches and runs a VBS script if the IP is Ukrainian. 3. The VBS reaches out to a Telegram account which provides an IP address. 4. The VBS connects to the IP, which returns a PowerShell script. 5. The PowerShell gets another IP from a different Telegram channel. 6. The PowerShell downloads the final payload from the new IP. 7. The payload executes on the victim system, achieving compromise. 8. The implanted malware connects to Telegram-based command and control infrastructure. 9. Gamaredon leverages access for espionage and monitoring Ukrainian targets. 10. The group rotates IPs and Telegram accounts to evade detection.
