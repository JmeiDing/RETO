1. Initial access - The PDF does not provide details on the initial compromise vector, but states that the Elastic Agent was likely deployed post-compromise. 2. Establish foothold - The attackers loaded the PHOREAL malware into the Windows control.exe process. PHOREAL is used to establish persistence and enable further exploitation. 3. Command and control - The malware contains an encrypted C2 domain which resolves to an IP address hosted on infrastructure in Hong Kong. 4. Lateral movement - No specific details provided, but the malware enables attackers to pivot and move laterally within the victim network. 5. Data exfiltration - While not explicitly stated, the purpose of the attack is likely to obtain sensitive data from the financial organization. PHOREAL provides remote access to compromise confidentiality. 6. Persistence - Loading PHOREAL into a signed Microsoft process (control.exe) achieves persistence on the compromised host. 7. Defense evasion - Running the malware directly in memory rather than writing files to disk helps evade detection.
