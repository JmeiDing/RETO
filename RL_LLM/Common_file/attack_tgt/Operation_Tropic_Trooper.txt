1. Attackers send spear-phishing emails with weaponized document attachments that exploit vulnerabilities like CVE-2010-3333 and CVE-2012-0158. 2. The attachments contain malicious code hidden using basic steganography techniques. 3. When the attachment is opened, it installs a Trojan downloader called TROJ_YAHOYAH. 4. TROJ_YAHOYAH accesses links to download an image file containing malware. 5. TROJ_YAHOYAH drops and installs the backdoor BKDR_YAHAMAM which persists via a registered DLL service. 6. BKDR_YAHAMAM exfiltrates data, downloads files, and allows remote shell access. 7. It also drops the rootkit RTKT_HIDEPORT.ZTCA-XO to hide evidence of C&C communication. 8. The attackers laterally move through the network using tools like HKTL_GETOS and HKTL_SHARESCAN to gather information from compromised systems.
