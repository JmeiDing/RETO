1. The attacker sends a spearphishing email with a malicious PDF exploiting CVE-2013-0640. 2. The victim opens the PDF, triggering the exploit to install the first stage MiniDuke backdoor. 3. The backdoor sets persistence via a startup LNK file and contacts the C2 over Twitter. 4. The C2 tweets an encrypted command triggering the malware to download the second stage from a compromised site. 5. The second stage backdoor can download more modules from the C2 servers. 6. The backdoors fingerprint the infected system and exfiltrate this data to the C2. 7. Additional payloads are delivered via encrypted GIFs from the command servers. 8. The final payloads allow the attacker to control the system and extract documents. 9. C2 logs reveal victims' details like location and system info.
