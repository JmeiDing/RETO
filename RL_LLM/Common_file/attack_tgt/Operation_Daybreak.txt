 1. Attackers send spear-phishing emails containing links to a hacked website hosting an exploit kit. 2. The exploit kit performs browser checks before redirecting visitors to a server controlled by the attackers. 3. The exploit page contains obfuscated JavaScript that decodes and decrypts the next stage Flash payload. 4. The Flash payload exploits the Adobe Flash zero-day (CVE-2016-4171) to achieve remote code execution. 5. The initial shellcode downloaded by the exploit retrieves and executes a DLL containing multiple payload execution methods. 6. One method abuses the Windows DDE protocol to silently execute a VBS script that installs a CAB file containing next-stage malware. 7. The final payload connects to a command and control server and contains capabilities focused on high-value targets.
