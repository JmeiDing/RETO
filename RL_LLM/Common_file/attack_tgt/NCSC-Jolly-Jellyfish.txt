1. The attacker sends the Jolly Jellyfish executable to the victim system. 2. Jolly Jellyfish downloads a BMP image file containing embedded shellcode. 3. It extracts the shellcode by reading every 4th byte from the pixel data. 4. The shellcode is decoded if necessary. 5. Jolly Jellyfish executes the extracted shellcode, which is a Cobalt Strike stager. 6. The stager connects to the attacker's Cobalt Strike C2 server to download and execute further payloads.
