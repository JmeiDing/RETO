1. Initial Access - Gain access by exploiting vulnerabilities like ProxyLogon in Exchange or CVE-2018-13379 in Fortinet devices. 2. Discovery - Use LOLBins like WMI and PowerShell to learn about the environment and identify valuable targets. 3. Credential Access - Enable WDigest registry key to store credentials in cleartext, then use rundll32 and MiniDump to dump LSASS and steal credentials. 4. Persistence - Create accounts like DefaultAccount, enable RDP, and use scheduled tasks to maintain access. 5. Privilege Escalation - Dump credentials to obtain higher privileges, create/modify accounts, and masquerade binaries. 6. Defense Evasion - Disable security services, use LOLBins, spoof certificates, and masquerade tools to avoid detection. 7. Lateral Movement - Use RDP and WMIExec to pivot to other systems on the network. 8. Impact - Use BitLocker and DiskCryptor to encrypt devices and demand ransom. Threaten to leak data if ransom isn't paid.
