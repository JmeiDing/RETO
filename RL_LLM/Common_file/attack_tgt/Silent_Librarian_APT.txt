Targets who click the links are taken to the phishing pages designed to steal their credentials. 5. Users are prompted to enter their usernames and passwords on the fake login pages. 6. The entered credentials are captured by the threat actor and compromised. 7. The group uses the stolen credentials to gain access to university accounts and further infiltrate networks. 8. They exfiltrate sensitive research data and intellectual property from compromised accounts and systems. 9. The phishing sites are quickly taken down, but the attacker rapidly registers new domains and continues attacks. 10.
