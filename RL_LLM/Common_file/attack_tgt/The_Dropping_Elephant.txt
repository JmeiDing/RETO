 1. The attack starts with a spear phishing email containing a document with embedded remote content. 2. When the user opens this document, it pings the attacker's server to signal the document was opened. 3. The attackers then send a second spear phishing email with an MS Word document that exploits CVE-2012-0158 or MS PowerPoint exploiting CVE-2014-6352. 4. The exploit drops an obfuscated AutoIT executable which executes. 5. The AutoIT backdoor downloads additional malware components from the command and control server. 6. The backdoor steals documents and data, and maintains communication with the C2.
