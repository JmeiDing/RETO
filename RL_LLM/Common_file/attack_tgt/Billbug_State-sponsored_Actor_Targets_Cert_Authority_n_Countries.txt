1. The attackers gained initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications of the target organizations. 2. They used dual-use tools like AdFind, WinRAR, and Certutil to help map the internal network and carry out activities. 3. Custom malware like the Hannotog and Sagerunex backdoors were deployed on compromised systems. 4. The backdoors provided capabilities like command execution, firewall manipulation, data exfiltration, and C2 communication. 5. The Sagerunex backdoor stores encrypted configuration files on disk and communicates with C2 servers over HTTPS. 6. Various techniques are used to proxy C2 traffic, including WPAD and web browsers. Commands allow theft of data, execution of code, and malware distribution. 7. While no data theft was observed, the targeting of government agencies points to espionage being the end goal. 8. The certificate authority was likely compromised with the intent of stealing certificates to sign malware and avoid detection.
