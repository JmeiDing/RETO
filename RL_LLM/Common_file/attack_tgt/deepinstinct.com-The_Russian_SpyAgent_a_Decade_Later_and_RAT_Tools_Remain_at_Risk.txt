1. The attacker distributes droppers disguised as cryptocurrency applications or other lures. Recently these droppers have been large 700MB+ files to avoid detection. 2. The dropper executes and downloads the SpyAgent malware bundled with the Safib Assistant remote access tool. 3. SpyAgent hooks functions used by Safib Assistant to stealthily take over the infected machine. For example, it obtains the session ID, disables logging, and hides the GUI. 4. The infected machine connects to the SpyAgent C2 server "thief[.]lol" which resolves to 185.125.206[.]172. 5. The attacker can now remotely control the infected machine through the C2 panel and Safib Assistant. They have full access without the victim's knowledge. 6. SpyAgent computes an environment hash using system info like machine GUID, OS version, username, etc. This identifies the infected host. 7. The encrypted SpyAgent config file is decrypted using a bitmap image file as the key derivation. This conceal the C2 and other settings. 8. Commands and data are exchanged with the C2 server over HTTP/web protocols.
