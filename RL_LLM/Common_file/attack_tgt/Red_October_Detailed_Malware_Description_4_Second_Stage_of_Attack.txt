 1. Initial infection via exploit, trojan, or other vector. 2. First stage runs reconnaissance and collects system data. 3. Second stage deploys modules for persistence, spreading, and exfiltration. 4. Persistence modules ensure malware continues running on infected systems. 5. Spreading modules scan for vulnerable systems and use exploits to infect them. 6. Exfiltration modules steal data and send it encrypted to command servers. 7. Modular architecture allows attackers to customize the attack by deploying only needed modules.
