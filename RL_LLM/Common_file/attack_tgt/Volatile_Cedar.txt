 1. The attacker scans public-facing web servers for vulnerabilities. 2. When a vulnerability is found, a web shell is installed on the compromised server. 3. The web shell is used to install the Explosive malware on the victim server. 4. Explosive establishes command and control communication to receive instructions. 5. Explosive exfiltrates data from the infected host back to attacker servers. 6. The malware spreads laterally using credentials extracted through keylogging and other techniques. 7. New versions of Explosive are deployed to infected hosts when detections occur to avoid exposure. 8. The tiered C2 infrastructure provides backup control and updating capabilities.
