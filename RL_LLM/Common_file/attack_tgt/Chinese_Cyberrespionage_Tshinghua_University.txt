 1. Threat actors gain access to Tibetan systems and install the Linux "ext4" backdoor. 2. "ext4" is embedded in a system "cron" file and runs hourly in the background. 3. The backdoor opens a libpcap handle to monitor network traffic. 4. It parses packets looking for TCP 443 with specific TCP header flags set. 5. If the right packets come in a 3 minute window, it decodes the XOR encrypted command. 6. The command is executed on the system via a bash shell. 7. Separately, the Tsinghua University IP 166.111.8.246 conducted reconnaissance on strategic economic targets. 8. The Tsinghua IP attempted connections to the Tibetan network's "ext4" backdoor. 9. But the IP did not send the proper TCP packets to activate the backdoor. 10. This suggests the reconnaissance activities and "ext4" backdoor are not linked.
