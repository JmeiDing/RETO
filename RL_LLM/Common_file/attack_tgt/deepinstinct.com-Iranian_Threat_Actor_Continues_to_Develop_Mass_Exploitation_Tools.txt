1. PHOSPHORUS conducted 7 exploitation attempts against an Exchange server. 2. Droppers "user.exe" and "task_update.exe" were deployed to create accounts, enable RDP access, and download FRPC tunneling tool. 3. A new version of "task_update.exe" installed a fake root certificate impersonating Microsoft. 4. FRPC variants connected to attacker-controlled domains posing as Microsoft, Symantec, etc. to blend malicious traffic. 5. FRPC tunnel enabled attacker access to compromised systems. 6. "Conser.exe" payload downloaded additional tools including Plink for SSH tunneling. 7. New root certificate validated FRPC's invalid certificate chain. 8. Blending domains technique introduced in early 2022 FRPC versions to evade detection. 9. PHOSPHORUS has been active since at least June 2020, evolving tools over time. 10. Group continues scanning and exploiting vulnerabilities to access organizations globally.
