1. PartyTicket ransomware takes a filename as a command line argument to encrypt. 2. If no argument given, it builds a list of files with targeted extensions to encrypt. 3. For each file, it copies itself using a randomized name based on timestamp. 4. The copy executes with the file passed as an argument to encrypt it. 5. Before encrypting, the file is renamed with a .encryptedJB extension. 6. The file is encrypted using a hardcoded AES key in GCM mode. 7. The AES key is encrypted with a hardcoded RSA public key and appended to the file. 8. A ransom note is written to the desktop after each file is encrypted. 9. The temporary copy of PartyTicket is deleted after encrypting the file.
