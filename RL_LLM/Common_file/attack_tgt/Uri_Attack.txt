 1. Victims receive a spear phishing email containing a malicious Word document as an attachment. 2. If the victim enables macros in the Word document, obfuscated malicious macro code is triggered. 3. The macro code decodes strings containing a Pastebin URL and a PowerShell script. 4. The PowerShell script downloads base64 encoded content from the Pastebin URL. 5. The base64 content is decoded into an executable malware file and dropped on the system. 6. The dropped executable malware (njRAT) is executed via the PowerShell script. 7. njRAT connects to a command and control server, sends system info, and allows the attacker to control the infected system.
