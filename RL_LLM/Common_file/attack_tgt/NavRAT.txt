 1. The attacker sends a spear-phishing email containing a malicious HWP document titled "Prospects for US-North Korea Summit" as a decoy. 2. When the victim opens the document, an embedded EPS object executes malicious shellcode. 3. The shellcode decodes and downloads the NavRAT remote access trojan payload from a compromised website. 4. NavRAT copies itself to run at startup and injects into Internet Explorer for stealth. 5. NavRAT logs keystrokes and communicates with the attacker via a hardcoded Naver email account. 6. The attacker sends commands and receives data by sending emails and attaching files.
