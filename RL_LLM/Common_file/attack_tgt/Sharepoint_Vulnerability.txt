 1. The attackers exploit CVE-2019-0604, a SharePoint vulnerability, to gain initial access to a Middle East government organization's SharePoint server. 2. The exploitation installs an Awen webshell on the SharePoint server. 3. The attackers use the Awen webshell to run commands and conduct reconnaissance on the compromised system. 4. The attackers install another webshell called AntSword on the SharePoint server. 5. The attackers interact with the AntSword webshell using a client tool and custom encoder. 6. The attackers use the AntSword webshell to upload tools like Mimikatz and Impacket to the server. 7. Mimikatz is used to dump credentials from the compromised SharePoint server. 8. The Impacket tools are used to execute commands on other systems using the dumped credentials. 9. The same Mimikatz variant is uploaded to a webshell on another government organization's server, suggesting the same threat actor. 10. The modular webshells allow the attacker to control the compromised servers and move laterally in the network.
