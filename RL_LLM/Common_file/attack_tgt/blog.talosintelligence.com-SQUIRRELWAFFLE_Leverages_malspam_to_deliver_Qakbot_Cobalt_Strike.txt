1. The attacker sends spam emails with malicious links to ZIP archives containing weaponized Office documents. 2. If the victim clicks the link, the ZIP archive downloads containing a malicious Word or Excel document. 3. When the victim opens the document, malicious macros or scripts execute. 4. The macros/scripts download the SQUIRRELWAFFLE malware loader DLL. 5. The DLL is executed via rundll32 or regsvr32, infecting the system. 6. SQUIRRELWAFFLE contacts the C2 server via HTTP POST requests to send recon and receive commands. 7. The C2 server can send secondary payloads like Qakbot or Cobalt Strike to further compromise the system. 8. The implanted malware provides persistence and allows lateral movement in the victim's network.
