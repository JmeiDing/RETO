Here is the process of the phishing attack described in the PDF document: 1. The attackers registered domains impersonating Chinese government agencies and companies using fake organization names. 2. The domains resolve to Icelandic hosting providers known for privacy and anonymity. 3. The attackers created subdomains for each target organization with similar naming conventions. 4. Valid SSL certificates were obtained for the domains to appear legitimate. 5. The subdomains hosted fake login pages mimicking the real organizations' email login pages. 6. When victims enter their email credentials on the fake login pages, their usernames and passwords are stolen by the attackers. 7. With the stolen credentials, the attackers could access the victims' email accounts and sensitive data. 8. The campaign has been active since at least May 2019 and was linked by a Chinese security firm to an alleged Indian APT group called BITTER APT. 9. The motivation appears to be espionage against Chinese government agencies and companies.
