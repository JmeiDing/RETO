1. The attackers send malicious Microsoft Word documents to targets, often using logos and branding of organizations the target would trust. 2. The documents prompt the user to enable macros to view the contents. 3. If the user enables macros, the document installs a PowerShell backdoor called POWERSTATS on the system. 4. POWERSTATS connects back to command and control servers operated by the attackers. 5. The attackers use the backdoor access to explore the compromised network and steal data. 6. The attackers periodically make small modifications to their tools and infrastructure, but rely largely on the same basic techniques over time.
