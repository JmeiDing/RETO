1. The attacker spreads the initial Adwind RAT malware payload as a JAR file hosted on Westnet servers. 2. The victim executes the JAR file which extracts another obfuscated JAR file into the %User% directory. 3. The extracted JAR file creates registry persistence, disables firewall/AV, and decrypts another embedded JAR file. 4. The decrypted JAR file loads the JRAT class which further loads the RAT DLL containing core functionality. 5. The RAT establishes command and control communication and can now capture webcam images, scan drives, inject processes, monitor the system, and exfiltrate data.
