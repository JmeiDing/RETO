 1. The initial infection vector is malicious Word documents distributed via email or download links. The documents have fake job postings and Korean language metadata. 2. The documents contain VBA macros that execute a dropper shellcode when opened. 3. The shellcode downloads the Rising Sun backdoor implant and a decoy Word doc from a command server. 4. Rising Sun executes on the system and phones home to the command server to exfiltrate system info like IP, username etc. 5. Rising Sun can receive commands from the server to further recon, read files, execute processes etc on the infected host. 6. Data exfiltrated from the infected host is encrypted and sent to the command server via HTTP requests. 7. The command server can send new commands to control the infected host, gather additional intel and pivot to further systems.
