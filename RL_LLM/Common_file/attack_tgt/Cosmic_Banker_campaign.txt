 1. The attack starts with the victim receiving a phishing email impersonating the Mexican tax authority SAT. The email contains a link to download a malicious .zip file. 2. The .zip file contains a .bat file that when executed, downloads a Powershell script from the attacker's server. 3. The Powershell script downloads additional malware components called Autolt from the attacker's server. This includes a packed DLL file and an executable. 4. The malware renames and moves the downloaded files to the %Public% folder on the victim's computer. 5. The malware creates persistence mechanisms like scheduled tasks and startup shortcuts to ensure it runs on reboot. 6. The malware uses MAPI calls to access the victim's Outlook contacts and harvests email addresses. 7. The harvested emails are exfiltrated to the attacker's remote server. 8. The DLL file likely contains the main banking trojan functionality to steal credentials and perform fraudulent transactions. 9. The executable acts as a loader for the malware DLL file. In summary, the initial injection vector is a phishing email leading to a multi-stage malware infection process ultimately aimed at stealing banking credentials and data from the infected system.
