1. The attackers compromised a website used by employees of a news agency in Lebanon using persistent XSS. 2. Malicious JavaScript was injected into the site to profile visitors and route targeted victims to the exploit server. 3. The exploit server collected extensive browser data on the victims before delivering exploits. 4. Exploits were sent over an encrypted channel established on top of TLS to hide them from interception. 5. A zero-day exploit targeting a WebRTC vulnerability in Chrome was used to achieve RCE. 6. This was chained to a separate sandbox escape exploit. 7. The DevilsTongue spyware payload attempted to escalate to kernel using a zero-day vulnerability in a signed driver. 8. The vulnerable driver had two flawed IOCTL handlers allowing arbitrary memory read/write. 9. The goal of the attacks was likely spying on journalists and news stories by compromising their devices. 10. To protect themselves, Chrome users need to update to the latest patched version. Other browsers were also affected and have released patches.
