 1. The attacker compromises a website and injects an exploit for CVE-2018-8174. 2. The victim visits the compromised site and the exploit triggers downloading of the first stage malware loader. 3. The loader checks for antivirus software and exploits CVE-2015-1701 to gain higher privileges. 4. The loader downloads and executes the second stage SLUB malware. 5. SLUB establishes persistence in the registry and extracts Slack API tokens for command and control. 6. SLUB downloads a GitHub gist snippet containing commands prefixed with "^" set by the attacker. 7. SLUB parses and executes commands from the gist like taking screenshots, listing files, etc. 8. Output from command execution is sent back to the attacker's Slack workspace in dedicated channels. 9. The attacker can post new commands in the gist snippet that will be executed when SLUB checks in. 10. The attacker uses the Slack channels to collect data like screenshots and documents from infected hosts.
