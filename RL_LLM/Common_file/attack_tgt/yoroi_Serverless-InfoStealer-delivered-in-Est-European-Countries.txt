 1. The attack starts with a weaponized PowerPoint document that executes a macro on close. 2. The macro redirects to a Bitly link which goes to a Blogspot page with VBScript code. 3. The VBScript downloads another script from Bitbucket which contains obfuscated .NET code. 4. The .NET code injects into the Windows Script Host process to run AgentTesla payloads from Bitbucket. 5. AgentTesla gathers system information, screenshots, keystrokes, credentials, etc. 6. The payloads communicate with command and control panels hosted on remote servers. 7. A scheduled task is used for persistence to re-execute the process.
