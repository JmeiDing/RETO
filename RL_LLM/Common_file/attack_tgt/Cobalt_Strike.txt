 1. The attacker distributes a malicious Word document resume via spear phishing. 2. The victim opens the document, triggering a macro. 3. The macro drops multiple files including a .NET executable loader. 4. The loader app checks the victim's country and decrypts/executes a shellcode stage. 5. The shellcode uses Cobalt Strike's Malleable C2 to mimic jQuery and download the final payload. 6. The executable payload allows the attackers to control the victim system via Cobalt Strike. 7. The attackers leverage the compromise to move laterally, collect data, and install additional tools.
