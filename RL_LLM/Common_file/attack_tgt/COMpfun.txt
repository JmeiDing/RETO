 1. The malware is distributed as a spoofed visa application file placed on a shared directory on the local network. 2. When the visa application is opened, it drops executable files ieframe.dll.mui and ExplorerFrame.dll.mui which contain the Trojan payload. 3. The Trojan initializes by resolving API functions, performing anti-analysis checks, and decrypting its configuration data. 4. It chooses a process to inject into - often a system or security process. 5. It contacts the C2 server over HTTP or HTTPS using rare status codes to receive commands. 6. Based on the status code received, it can install persistence, gather system info, spread via USB, etc. 7. It exfiltrates data like keystrokes, screenshots, and system info encrypted with an RSA public key. 8. The Trojan also continually gathers data like keystrokes and screenshots independently of C2 commands. 9. It spreads to USB devices when they are connected by injecting itself. 10. The C2 can also send arbitrary commands to the Trojan to further control the compromised system.
