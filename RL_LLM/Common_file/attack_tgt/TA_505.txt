1. The attacker sends a phishing email with a weaponized Office document attachment impersonating a legitimate business communication. 2. The document contains macros or exploits that execute when opened by the victim, launching a downloader. 3. The downloader fetches malware payloads from the attacker's command and control server. 4. Downloaded payloads include remote access tools like ServHelper and the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) tool. 5. RMS is installed silently along with configuration files and shell scripts. 6. The malware establishes persistence through registry modifications and scheduled tasks. 7. RMS connects to the attacker's infrastructure to beacon home and enable remote access. 8. The attacker leverages RMS remote control capabilities for reconnaissance, lateral movement, data exfiltration, and financial theft. 9. RMS allows unsophisticated actors to mimic the tactics, techniques, and procedures of advanced groups like TA505. 10. The attack cycle continues through maintenance of persistence and adaptation of payloads over time.
