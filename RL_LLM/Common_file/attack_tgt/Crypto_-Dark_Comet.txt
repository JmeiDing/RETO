 1. The bot connects to the command and control (C&C) server, encrypting its communications using the algorithm described. 2. The C&C server sends an encrypted command to the bot instructing it to launch a DDoS attack. Common commands include "DDOSHTTPFLOOD", "DDOSUDPFLOOD", and "DDOSSYNFLOOD". 3. The bot decrypts the command and launches the requested DDoS attack type. 4. For HTTP flood attacks, the bot mistakenly encrypts the hardcoded HTTP request string before sending it, turning it into gibberish. 5. The bot sends the encrypted gibberish to the target IP and port at a rapid rate, constituting the DDoS attack. 6. Due to flaws in the HTTP request generation and encryption, the HTTP flood behaves merely as a simple TCP flood. 7. After the timer expires, the bot reports back status to the C&C server that the attack has completed.
