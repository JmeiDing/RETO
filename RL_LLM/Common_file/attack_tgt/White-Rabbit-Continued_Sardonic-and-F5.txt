1. The initial infection vector and installation of the backdoor is not specified, but occurs via unknown means, possibly manual installation. 2. The PowerShell script reaches out to download the Sardonic or F5 backdoor DLL from a command and control server. 3. The backdoor DLL decrypts and executes embedded shellcode after checking for "powershell.exe" as the parent process. 4. The shellcode copies the access token from lsass.exe to gain system privileges and connects to the C2 server. 5. The C2 server sends commands to perform actions like stealing data or running additional scripts. 6. For ransomware attacks, the White Rabbit malware is deployed which encrypts files based on command line arguments. 7. After encryption, White Rabbit deletes itself and leaves a ransom note.
