1. Sample A is a self-extracting archive containing Samples B, C, and D. Sample A is likely distributed through another infection vector like a malicious Office document. 2. Executing Sample A extracts the files Samples B, C, and D and runs Sample B (mcvsmap.exe). 3. Sample B loads Sample C (McUtil.DLL), which in turn loads and decrypts Sample D (McUtil.DLL.PPT) into executable memory. 4. Sample D code is executed, which decrypts and decompresses malware Sample E in memory. 5. Sample E initializes and injects itself into signed Microsoft binaries svchost.exe and msiexec.exe. 6. The infected svchost.exe and msiexec.exe communicate over encrypted TCP with the command and control server help.yahoo-upgrade.com. 7. The malware executes commands received from the C&C server to perform malicious actions on the infected system.
