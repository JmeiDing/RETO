 1. Initial infection via weaponized documents, LNK files executing mshta, or template injection attack. 2. Stage 1 HTA file downloads and executes a .NET module hta.dll which retrieves the next stage HTA. 3. Stage 2 HTA drops and side loads DLLs like DUser.dll, executes credwiz.exe to sideload DUser.dll, and drops the final RAT payload. 4. DUser.dll connects to C2 servers and accepts commands to execute actions like file upload/download, command execution, etc. 5. RAT payload like Allakore_Remote or custom .NET RATs allow remote access and exfiltration capabilities.
