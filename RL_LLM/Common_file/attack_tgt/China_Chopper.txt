 1. Attackers exploit a vulnerable web application to install the China Chopper web shell malware. 2. China Chopper malware provides attackers with a GUI client to configure command and control servers. 3. The client submits HTTP requests with base64 encoded commands to the server side web shell. 4. The web shell executes commands on the system like reconnaissance, lateral movement, and exfiltration. 5. Case 1 espionage attack: - Used WinRAR to compress documents into encrypted archives. - Leveraged PowerShell scripts to dump databases. - Mapped drives and copied data for exfiltration. 6. Case 2 multi-purpose attack: - Delivered ransomware payloads. - Installed Monero cryptocurrency miners. - Collected credentials via Mimikatz. 7. Case 3 web hosting provider attack: - Added admin users. - Exploited Windows vulnerabilities to escalate privileges. - Used Mimikatz to dump credentials. - Modified ACLs to spread access. - Potentially defaced websites. 8. Attackers can tunnel traffic, pivot internally, and exfiltrate data extracted via the web shell. 9. Defenders should update software, use protections like IPS and sandboxing, and hunt proactively.
