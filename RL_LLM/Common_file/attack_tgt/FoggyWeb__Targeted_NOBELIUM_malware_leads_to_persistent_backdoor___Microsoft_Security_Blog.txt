 1. NOBELIUM gains admin access to an AD FS server. 2. They drop a malicious DLL loader and encrypted backdoor DLL. 3. The loader hijacks DLL search order to execute instead of the legitimate DLL. 4. It decrypts and loads the backdoor DLL into the AD FS service process. 5. The backdoor sets up HTTP listeners for specific URI patterns as commands. 6. Commands exfiltrate the AD FS certificates and configuration database. 7. Commands can also download and execute assemblies or source code. 8. The backdoor leverages AD FS APIs to retrieve and decrypt certificates. 9. Exfiltrated data is concealed as fake image files before sending to attacker. 10.
