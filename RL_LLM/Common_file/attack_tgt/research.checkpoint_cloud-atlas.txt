 1. The group sends spearphishing emails with weaponized Office documents containing malicious templates that exploit Equation Editor vulnerabilities. 2. If successfully exploited, the documents install a Powershell backdoor called PowerShower. 3. PowerShower connects to command and control servers to receive additional payloads. 4. One payload is a .NET proxy tool that relays commands between servers. 5. Another payload is a modular espionage framework that uses encrypted configurations and cloud storage for command and control. It collects data from the victim's machine. 6. The attackers use the compromised machines to move laterally in the network, gain domain admin access, and extract password hashes from the domain controller. 7. They impersonate privileged accounts and sysadmin activities to further access servers, endpoints and network devices. 8. Additional tools are used for discovery, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
