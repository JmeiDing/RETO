 1. Cobalt sends phishing emails with malicious attachments such as droppers disguised as browser updates or VHD files containing malware. 2. If the victim downloads and executes the attachment, the malware dropper is installed on the system. The dropper may use anti-analysis and obfuscation techniques to evade detection. 3. The dropper installs the JavaScript backdoor more_eggs either directly or via downloaded plugins. More_eggs provides remote access capabilities. 4. The more_eggs backdoor collects system information for reconnaissance and sends it to Cobalt's command and control servers. 5. Cobalt operators issue commands to more_eggs to further compromise the system, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the network. 6. Eventually, Cobalt attempts to obtain financial data or funds by manipulating systems and accounts. The group may also install additional malware. 7. Throughout the attack, Cobalt aims to maintain persistence using techniques like scheduled tasks, registry modifications, and service installation. 8. Cobalt continually refines its malware tools and infrastructure to avoid detection. The group updates tactics as security researchers release details on their methods.
