1. The attacker distributes the Alchimist C2 server on a compromised machine. 2. Alchimist extracts its embedded web interface and Insekt payloads/assets at runtime. 3. The attacker accesses the Alchimist web UI to configure an Insekt payload with C2 and other settings. 4. Alchimist dynamically builds and delivers the Insekt payload to the attacker. 5. The attacker distributes the Insekt trojan to victims using techniques like malicious documents. 6. Insekt runs on compromised machines and connects to the Alchimist C2. 7. The attacker sends commands through the Alchimist web UI to control Insekt on victims' systems. 8. Insekt executes actions like remote command execution, screenshot capture, file exfiltration on victims. 9. Data is sent from Insekt back to the Alchimist C2 server. 10. Additional lateral movement and exploitation may occur using other tools.
