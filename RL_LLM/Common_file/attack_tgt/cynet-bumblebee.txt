 1. Threat actors send spear phishing emails with URLs linking to file sharing sites like TransferXL that contain malicious ZIP files. 2. The ZIP files contain ISO image files with names like "documents-04-106.iso". 3. The ISO files contain a malicious LNK file and a malicious DLL payload. The LNK file icon is masqueraded as a folder and the DLL is hidden to trick users. 4. Users mount the ISO files, click the LNK, which executes the DLL payload via rundll32.exe. 5. The DLL payload copies itself to %ProgramData% and creates a VBS script for persistence. 6. The malware establishes command and control communication and sends system info. 7. The C2 sends back commands, likely to deliver next stage ransomware. 8. The malware uses anti-VM and anti-sandbox techniques to avoid detection. 9. It uses WMI queries to gather system info for discovery. 10. An AdFind tool is used to enumerate the network.
