 1. The attack starts with a spear phishing email containing a malicious Office document attachment. 2. The document macro reaches out to download a remote template containing additional macro code. 3. The macro writes and executes shellcode from an INIT file to setup persistence and run the next stage loader. 4. The loader DLL sideloads a legitimate Windows binary like cmdl32.exe. 5. The loader decrypts and executes shellcode from the INIT file. 6. The shellcode injects into and executes the Nimbda loader module within notepad.exe. 7. Nimbda decrypts and loads the next stage - an obfuscated SPINNER backdoor executable. 8. SPINNER injects into msiexec.exe and collects system info to beacon back to its command and control server. 9. SPINNER can receive additional modules or payloads from the attacker controlled server. 10. The final payload provides remote access, exfiltration, and further capabilities to the attacker.
