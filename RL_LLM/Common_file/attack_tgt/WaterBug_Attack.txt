1. Waterbug sends spear phishing emails with malicious attachments to target individuals. The attachments exploit vulnerabilities like zero-days to install Trojan.Wipbot on the victim's computer. 2. Waterbug compromises websites and sets them up as watering holes on their Venom network. When visitors arrive from IPs of interest, Waterbug fingerprints their software versions and selectively delivers Trojan.Wipbot or Trojan.Turla. 3. The initial Trojan.Wipbot malware gathers information like network credentials from the infected computer and network. It can also download updated versions of Trojan.Turla. 4. Trojan.Turla allows persistent, long-term monitoring of the victim's activities. It exfiltrates data through a proxy network to Waterbug's servers. 5. Waterbug continuously develops new versions of Trojan.Turla with shared components and code. This allows flexible, extensible monitoring powered by a malware platform tailored to their needs.
