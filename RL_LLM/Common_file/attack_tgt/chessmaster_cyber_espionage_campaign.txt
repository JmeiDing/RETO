 1. The attack starts with spear-phishing emails containing malicious LNK files as attachments. 2. The LNK file executes a Command Prompt to download a PowerShell script. 3. The PowerShell script either directly drops or reflectively loads the ChChes malware. 4. In other cases, the phishing email contains a self-extracting archive with payloads. 5. Extraction triggers DLL hijacking to execute the payloads like ChChes. 6. ChChes establishes command and control communication to receive commands. 7. Additional malware like RedLeaves or TinyX may be downloaded for persistence. 8. Hacking tools are used to dump credentials for lateral movement. 9. Finally, the attackers leverage access and malware on compromised systems to exfiltrate data and achieve other objectives.
