 1. Void Balaur scans for potential targets and looks for security weaknesses like exposed APIs, unsecured databases, vulnerable devices, and leaked credentials. 2. If the group finds an exploitable security issue, they deliver malware payloads like credential stealers, cryptocurrency miners, IRC bots, etc. 3. The credential stealers search for and exfiltrate sensitive credentials for email, cloud services, SSH, and more. 4. Stolen credentials provide access to additional systems to infect. 5. Void Balaur uses IRC bots for command and control of compromised devices. 6. The bots can deploy further payloads like additional malware and cryptocurrency miners on infected machines. 7. Custom Android spyware is also used to gather data from mobile devices. 8. Rootkits like Diamorphine hide malware processes for stealth.
