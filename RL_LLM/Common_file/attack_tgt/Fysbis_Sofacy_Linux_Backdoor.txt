1. Sofacy actors use spearphishing emails containing links or attachments to deliver Fysbis malware to targets. 2. If necessary, Fysbis uses privilege escalation exploits to gain root access on the Linux system. 3. Fysbis establishes persistence on the victim system by installing itself to locations like /bin/rsyncd or ~/.config/ksysdef/ksysdefd. 4. Fysbis fingerprints the victim environment by checking distribution, kernel version, etc. 5. Fysbis decrypts and extracts commands and other modules from C2 server communications. 6. Fysbis executes modules to carry out behaviors like command execution, remote shell, file download/upload. 7. Fysbis sends any collected data from the victim system back to the C2 server. 8. Fysbis awaits further commands from the C2 server to continue intelligence gathering, lateral movement, or other objectives.
