1. The attacker sends a phishing email containing an archived file as attachment to the target. 2. The archive contains a malicious link file, Office document, or trojanized app. 3. The embedded malicious file executes and fetches a remote HTA file. 4. The HTA file executes a loader DLL that installs the remote access trojan payload. 5. The RAT payload communicates with the C2 server to receive commands. 6. The RAT can execute commands, download additional payloads, collect files, and exfiltrate data. 7. Stolen data and documents are sent to the C2 server over HTTP or TCP. 8. The attacker monitors infections and extracted data using their "Scout" system. 9. New attacks use weaponized Publisher files or trojanized apps to deploy the RAT. 10. A new AuTo Stealer exfiltrates documents and data over HTTP/TCP.
