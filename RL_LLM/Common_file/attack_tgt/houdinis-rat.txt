1. The attacker uses the H-W0rm builder tool to generate a malicious VBS or PE file with desired capabilities enabled. 2. The attacker delivers the malicious file to victims via emails, compromised sites, social engineering, etc. 3. When executed, H-W0rm installs itself on the victim machine, setting registry keys or scheduled tasks for persistence. 4. H-W0rm connects to a command and control server specified in the builder configuration. 5. The attacker can now fully control the infected machine remotely, executing commands like taking screenshots, logging keystrokes, activating the webcam, etc. 6. H-W0rm exfiltrates data like passwords and screenshots back to the attacker's server. 7. Some versions of H-W0rm are able to evade detection by antivirus software on the victim machines. 8. The attacker can use the builder to update H-W0rm malware on infected machines to evolve the attack.
