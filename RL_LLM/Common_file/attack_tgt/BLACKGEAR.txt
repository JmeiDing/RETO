1. Binder malware (TROJ_BLAGFLDR) is delivered via phishing or watering hole attacks. 2. The binder executes a downloader malware (TSPY_RAMNY or TSPY_YMALRMINI) in the background. 3. The binder drops a decoy folder with fake documents and deletes itself to avoid detection. 4. The downloader sends system information back to the attacker's site. 5. The downloader connects to sites controlled by the attacker and downloads a backdoor (BKDR_ELIRKS or BKDR_YMALR). 6. The backdoor retrieves encrypted C2 instructions from blogs/microblogs. 7. The backdoor decrypts the C2 instructions to get the C2 server location. 8. The backdoor connects to the C2 server and can receive commands to: - Exfiltrate data - Take screenshots - Download and execute files - Open a remote shell 9. The backdoor remains persistent on the infected system to maintain access.
