 1. The attackers distribute malicious Android APK files, often masquerading as legitimate apps like banks, social networks, photo services, etc. 2. If the victim installs one of the malicious apps, it requests access to permissions like reading/sending SMS, contacts access, etc. 3. The infected app connects to one of the Geost C&C servers and PHP files. It sends information like SMS messages, contacts, location, etc back to the C&C. 4. The botnet operators log into the C&C dashboard to view all the collected personal data from victims, including SMS history, bank balances, names, addresses, etc. 5. The C&C panel provides options for the botmasters to target specific banks, manage spam campaigns, and possibly perform financial fraud by abusing the collected bank account information. 6. The extensive personal data harvested from victims provides the botmasters with information to aid social engineering attacks or identity theft.
