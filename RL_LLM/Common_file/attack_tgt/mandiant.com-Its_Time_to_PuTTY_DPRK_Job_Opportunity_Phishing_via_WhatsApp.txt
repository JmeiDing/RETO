 1. UNC4034 initiates communication with the victim over WhatsApp, posing as Amazon and offering a fake job opportunity. 2. UNC4034 sends the victim an ISO file titled "amazon_assessment.iso" containing a trojanized PuTTY executable and connection instructions. 3. The victim downloads and executes the trojanized PuTTY binary. 4. When the victim attempts to connect to the remote server specified in the ISO file, the malicious PuTTY binary drops and executes the DAVESHELL shellcode loader. 5. DAVESHELL loads and executes the AIRDRY.V2 backdoor payload in memory. 6. AIRDRY.V2 provides persistent access to the victim system and allows the threat actor to further interact with the compromised host.
