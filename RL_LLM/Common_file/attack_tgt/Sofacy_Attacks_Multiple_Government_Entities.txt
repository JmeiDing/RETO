 1. The attack starts with a phishing email containing a weaponized Excel document as an attachment. The email pretends to be from Jane's 360 defense events, and the document claims to contain an event calendar. 2. If the victim enables macros in the Excel document, it executes a malicious macro. The macro decodes and executes a custom Trojan downloader embedded in the spreadsheet cells. 3. The downloader Trojan installs and executes a payload DLL on the system. The payload is a variant of the SofacyCarberp Trojan. 4. The SofacyCarberp Trojan gathers system information like running processes, NIC details, disk name, and takes a screenshot. It sends this to a C2 server. 5. The C2 server can respond with commands for additional actions like downloading more malware, injecting code into browsers, deleting files, etc. 6. The Trojan is capable of injecting code into browsers like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome to communicate with the C2 server from their context as well. 7. The malware uses techniques like simulating a screenshot hotkey press and API hashing to make analysis more difficult.
