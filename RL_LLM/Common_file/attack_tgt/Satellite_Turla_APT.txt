1. The attackers identify unencrypted downstream satellite internet links and the IP ranges routed through them. 2. The attackers set up equipment - satellite dish, LNB, and DVB-S tuner card - to receive the satellite broadcast. 3. The attackers listen for packets sent to IPs in the identified satellite ranges. 4. When a packet (e.g. TCP SYN) is sent to one of these IPs, the attackers spoof a reply (e.g. SYN ACK) back to the sender using a conventional internet connection. 5. The legitimate user of the satellite link ignores the packet since it's sent to an unopened port. 6. The attackers can now communicate with the original sender IP while hiding behind the satellite IP range. 7. The attackers set up command and control servers within the satellite IP ranges to anonymize their infrastructure. 8. The satellite links are cycled regularly to new IPs to avoid takedowns.
