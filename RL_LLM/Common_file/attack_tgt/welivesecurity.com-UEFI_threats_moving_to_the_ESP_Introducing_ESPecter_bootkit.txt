1. Achieve persistence by infecting Windows Boot Manager on the ESP to execute boot code before the OS. 2. Boot code patches Windows functions to disable integrity checks and bypass Driver Signature Enforcement. 3. Load unsigned kernel driver at startup after disabling Driver Signature Enforcement. 4. Kernel driver injects user-mode payloads into specific processes. 5. Payloads collect keystrokes, documents, screenshots and communicate with C&C server. 6. Collected data is encrypted and exfiltrated to C&C server. 7. Payloads can download additional malware from C&C server. 8. Bootkit uses anti-analysis and hiding techniques to remain stealthy.
