 1. In early July 2015, an Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119) was publicly disclosed as part of the Hacking Team data breach. 2. Within 72 hours, this same exploit was incorporated into specific webpages on the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) website relating to the Philippines vs. China territorial dispute case. 3. The exploit was hosted on a domain registered using falsified information - pic.nicklockluckydog[.]org. The domain resolved to an IP address in Phoenix, Arizona. 4. On July 10, 2015 when the tribunal convened, the exploit domain shifted to a Netherlands IP address. 5. The exploit delivered a malware payload (Rdws.exe) which used DLL sideloading to deploy a backdoor (ticrf.rat). 6. The malware connected back to the exploit domain and a related domain registered with a Chinese email address. 7. ThreatConnect analyzed the technical details of the attack and concluded it was likely a targeted effort by Chinese state-sponsored hackers to monitor those interested in the public court case.
