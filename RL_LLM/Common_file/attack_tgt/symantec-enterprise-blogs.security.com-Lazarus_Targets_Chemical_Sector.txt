 1. The attacker sends a malicious HTM file likely via a phishing email or compromised website. 2. The HTM file executes a malicious signed DLL file that injects into a legitimate system process. 3. The DLL downloads and executes a backdoor payload from a command-and-control server. 4. A series of shellcode loaders are used to download additional malware and arbitrary commands. 5. Malware is executed from malicious exports added to legitimate binaries like LZMA Utils. 6. The attackers move laterally using WMI and steal credentials by dumping registry hives. 7. Various persistence techniques are deployed using scheduled tasks and bat files. 8. Post-compromise tools are deployed for screenshots, logging, remote access, etc. 9. Sensitive documents and data are exfiltrated from the compromised networks. 10. The modular malware enables the attackers to customize operations for espionage and data theft.
