1. The attackers send spearphishing emails with malware-laden attachments to selected targets. 2. If the user opens the attachment, the malware infects their system providing initial access. 3. The malware installs EquationDrug components including drivers for persistence, rootkit, packet capture etc. 4. The rootkit driver hides the malware services and files from the host system. 5. The orchestrator executes and loads core plugins like encryption, command and control, compression. 6. Additional plugins are installed to enable specific surveillance like keylogging, browser monitoring. 7. The sniffer driver intercepts and filters traffic based on configured rules. 8. Traffic that matches the rules is processed for injected code commands or exfiltrated. 9. The C2 communication plugins send collected data to the attacker servers. 10. The attackers analyze the received data and send back any additional plugins or tasks to further infiltrate the infected system/network. 11. Custom plugins deploy modules tailored specifically to the target's system and activity. 12. The modular platform allows the attackers to expand their access and closely monitor the target by deploying plugins as needed. 13. The process continues with the malware persisting on critical systems and providing long-term infiltration.
