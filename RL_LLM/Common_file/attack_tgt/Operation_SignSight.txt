1. Attackers compromised the VGCA website and trojanized two software installers hosted on it. 2. The trojanized installers included a backdoor named PhantomNet. 3. When executed by a victim, the installer would install the legitimate VGCA software and PhantomNet. 4. PhantomNet would communicate with C2 servers using HTTPS and certificate pinning. 5. PhantomNet could collect system info, proxy settings, credentials from the victim system. 6. PhantomNet could download additional plugins, including ones focused on lateral movement. 7. By hijacking the trusted VGCA software installers, the attackers could silently compromise targets that downloaded and installed the trojanized software.
