1. Perform reconnaissance on targets to gather information for spear-phishing attacks. 2. Send spear-phishing emails containing links to zip archives hosted on compromised sites. The emails use lures like job offers. 3. Users download and execute executables from the zip archives, which install the CloudDuke downloader. 4. The downloader retrieves and executes the CloudDuke trojans - BastionSolution or OneDriveSolution. 5. The trojans establish command and control communications using the victim's OneDrive account. 6. The trojans exfiltrate stolen data by uploading it to the OneDrive account. 7. The Duke operators retrieve commands and data from the OneDrive account using VPN connections to stay anonymous. 8. The trojans can also download other malware components like SeaDuke for further infections. 9. CloudDuke trojans and additional malware create covert backdoors and collect data from the compromised network. 10. The Duke group periodically updates the malware with new versions to avoid detection and maintain persistent access.
