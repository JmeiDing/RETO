 1. The attackers compromised credentials for a Secure Access instance to gain initial access. 2. They used tools like SoftPerfect Network Scanner, ADFind, and AccountRestore to discover network assets and harvest credentials. 3. The attackers deployed a custom malware called Sockbot, which is a modified version of Ligolo, to establish C2 channels. 4. Sockbot exposed internal RDP servers through its tunneling capabilities to enable lateral movement. 5. The attackers moved laterally and deployed Cobalt Strike beacons via PowerShell downloaders. 6. The Cobalt Strike beacons connected to a C2 server hosted on port 80. 7. The beacons used process injection techniques to execute shellcode after making web requests to the C2. 8. If the C2 server responded correctly, the shellcode would have been injected into PowerShell and executed.
