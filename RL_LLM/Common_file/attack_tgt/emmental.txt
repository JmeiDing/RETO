1. The attacker sends a phishing email containing a malicious .zip or .docx file to the victim. 2. If the victim opens the attachment on a macOS system, the OSX_DOK malware is installed. 3. OSX_DOK shows a fake OSX software update screen to gain admin access. 4. The malware installs malicious certificates and proxies on the system to perform a MITM attack. 5. When the user visits a target banking/financial site, their connection is hijacked and redirected to a fake login page controlled by the attacker. 6. The victim enters account credentials on the fake page, which are secretly sent to the attacker's server. 7. The attacker can then log into the real banking site using the stolen credentials to steal money or sensitive data. 8. OSX_DOK can also download additional payloads, executables, and scripts from its command and control server. 9. The malware establishes persistence on the infected system to continue monitoring and data theft. 10. Network traffic is redirected through Tor to evade detection and obscure the attacker's location.
