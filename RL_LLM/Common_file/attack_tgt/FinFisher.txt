FinSpy gathers information from the infected device such as passwords, communications, files and sends it to the command server. 4. For mobile versions like FinSpy Mobile, it can also capture information like GPS location and calls, and exfiltrate data via SMS to a phone number. 5. Collected information is sent back to the FinFisher operators for monitoring and surveillance of the targets.
