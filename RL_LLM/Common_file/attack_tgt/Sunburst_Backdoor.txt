 1. Threat actor UNC2452 compromises the software build and code signing systems of SolarWinds. 2. The attacker injects the SUNBURST backdoor into legitimate SolarWinds Orion software updates. 3. The trojanized updates are digitally signed by SolarWinds and distributed from March-May 2020. 4. Customers download and install the compromised SolarWinds updates. 5. The backdoor activates after an initial dormant period of up to 2 weeks. 6. SUNBURST uses DGA to contact C2 servers mimicking Orion Improvement Program traffic. 7. The C2 server sends jobs for discovery, lateral movement, data theft, and payload delivery. 8. The backdoor profiles the system, transfers files, and executes commands received from the C2. 9. Persistence is maintained through continuous polling for jobs and clearing of artifacts. 10. Stolen credentials are used to move laterally and carry out cyber espionage activities.
