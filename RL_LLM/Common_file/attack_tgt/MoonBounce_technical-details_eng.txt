1. Compromise system firmware and implant rogue UEFI module containing MoonBounce. 2. Rogue firmware hooks legitimate boot services functions like AllocatePool and ExitBootServices. 3. Hooks execute shellcode during boot that injects a kernel driver. 4. Driver injects malware stager into svchost.exe process. 5. Stager reaches out to C2 server to download next stage payload. 6.
