1. The threat actor sends a phishing email with a malicious XLL Excel add-in file attachment. 2. The victim downloads and executes the XLL file. 3. Excel loads the XLL file and calls the xlAutoOpen function inside it. 4. The xlAutoOpen function calls mw_download_and_execute to download the JSSLoader payload from a remote server. 5. The XLL file writes the downloaded payload to a temp file and executes it. 6. The obfuscated JSSLoader payload executes on the victim's system, evading detection. 7. JSSLoader establishes command and control communication to enable further malicious activity by the threat actor.
