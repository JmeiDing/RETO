1. OilRig set up fake websites impersonating a VPN portal, University of Oxford sites, and job portals. 2. The fake sites hosted malware bundled with legitimate software like Juniper VPN clients and CV creators. 3. OilRig sent emails to targets with links to the fake sites or attached weaponized Office documents. 4. If users visited the fake sites and downloaded files, the bundled malware would infect their systems. 5. The malware connected to C2 domains to receive commands and exfiltrate data. 6. OilRig used valid but likely stolen code signing certificates to digitally sign the malware and avoid detection. 7. The malware established persistence and harvested information from compromised systems. 8. Infrastructure overlaps suggest links between OilRig and other Iranian threat groups.
