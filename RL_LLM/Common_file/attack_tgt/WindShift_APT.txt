 1. Phase 1 - Reconnaissance: WINDSHIFT builds fake personas on social media over 1-2 years to gather information on targets and befriend them. 2. Phase 2 - Monitoring: WINDSHIFT sends benign emails with tracking to targets over 6-12 months to monitor behavior and increase trust. 3. Phase 3 - Credential Harvesting: WINDSHIFT sends phishing emails or SMS impersonating services like Gmail and iCloud to steal credentials, with domains active for only 1 day. 4. Phase 4 - Malware Infection: If phishing fails, WINDSHIFT sends emails with malware attachments or links to infect target systems. This is used rarely and sparingly. 5. Phase 5 - Disappear: WINDSHIFT switches infrastructure and acquires new tools to avoid detection, going quiet for months between campaigns.
