1. The attackers sent spear phishing emails containing Word documents to targets within the Mongolian government. The documents claimed to contain instructions for webmail login or information about a state law proposal. 2. When targets enabled macros in the documents, it triggered malicious VBA macro code. 3. The macro code executed regsvr32.exe to bypass application whitelisting and invoke a malicious Windows Script Component (SCT) file hosted online. 4. The SCT file contained code to launch an obfuscated PowerShell script. 5. The obfuscated PowerShell script downloaded and opened a decoy Word document to distract the user. 6. The PowerShell script also downloaded and executed another obfuscated PowerShell script named f0921.ps1. 7. The f0921.ps1 script set a registry value to persistently store an encoded PowerShell payload. 8. It also set up a registry run key to execute the encoded payload on login. 9. The encoded PowerShell payload in the registry used the publicly available Inject-LocalShellcode script to inject shellcode. 10. The shellcode decrypted and injected the Poison Ivy RAT into the userinit.exe process. 11. Analysis of the Poison Ivy configuration showed it was set up for keylogging, screen capture, password theft and other RAT functions.
