 1. The weaponized Office document remotely loads an initial Flash file from the attacker's server. 2. The initial Flash file stages a second encrypted Flash file containing the exploit. 3. The exploit triggers the zero-day vulnerability to achieve code execution. 4. Additional encrypted payloads are downloaded, likely for backdoor access or further exploitation. 5. Throughout the process, the Flash files phone home to the attacker's command and control server to track the attack.
