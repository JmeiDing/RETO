 1. Threat actors distribute weaponized documents exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerability to targets. 2. The documents contain Hong Kong political themes as decoys to trick users into opening them. 3. Once executed, the exploit drops a self-extracting RAR archive containing three files: A signed legitimate executable (RasTls.exe), A malicious DLL (ssMUIDLL.dll), An encoded Poison Ivy shellcode file (hlp). 4. The legitimate executable sideloads the malicious DLL. 5. The DLL loads and decodes the shellcode file, executing the SPIVY Poison Ivy RAT. 6. SPIVY connects to command and control domains registered with Hong Kong political references. 7. Threat actors use SPIVY's remote access capabilities to further compromise the infected system and network.
