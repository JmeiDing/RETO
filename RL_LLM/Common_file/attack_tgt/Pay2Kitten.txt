 1. The attackers first gain initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in VPN appliances like Citrix NetScaler or Fortinet. 2. They use tools like FRPC and Ngrok to create reverse proxy tunnels between compromised machines and their C2 servers. 3. The attackers install web shells on the victim networks to maintain persistent access. 4. They create local admin accounts with hardcoded passwords like "Kharpedar123!" for lateral movement. 5. Post-compromise, they use remote access tools like RDP to connect to compromised hosts. 6. They exfiltrate data from the victim networks. 7. In some cases, they deploy ransomware like Pay2Key to encrypt files and extort payments. 8. They threaten to leak stolen data on underground sites to pressure victims into paying.
