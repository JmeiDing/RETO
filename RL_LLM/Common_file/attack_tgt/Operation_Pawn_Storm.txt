1. Spear-phishing emails are sent containing weaponized document attachments that exploit vulnerabilities like CVE-2010-3333 or CVE-2012-0158. 2. Opening the attachment displays a decoy document while an exploit runs in the background, dropping a downloader component like netids.dll. 3. The downloader communicates with a C&C server and downloads additional malware like a keylogger. 4. The keylogger captures sensitive information from the infected system and exfiltrates the data back to the C&C server. 5. In some cases, the emails contained links to phishing websites that mimic conferences or media outlets. 6. Visiting these sites causes a JavaScript to execute that redirects the victim's webmail session to a fake login page, capturing their credentials when re-entered.
