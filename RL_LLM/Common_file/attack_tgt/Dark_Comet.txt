 1. The Syrian regime operatives distribute Trojaned files, disguised as legitimate documents, to targets via email or Skype. 2. When the activist opens the file, it silently installs the Dark Comet RAT on their computer. 3. Dark Comet provides remote access to the attacker, allowing spying through the webcam, microphone, and logging keystrokes. 4. The infected computer is then used as a stepping stone to target the activist's contacts via Skype and attempt to infect them as well. 5. Data exfiltrated from Dark Comet provides intelligence that likely leads to physical arrests of the activists by the regime. 6. Anti-regime activists became aware of Dark Comet's use when they lost account access and detected it on their systems. 7. Pressured by media reports and activists, the developer of Dark Comet released a removal tool and eventually took the malware offline. However, the Syrian regime continues similar attacks using other RATs.
