1. Gamaredon sends phishing emails with weaponized Office documents containing malicious macros to Ukrainian government targets. 2. The macros download RAR archives containing LNK files when documents are opened. 3. The LNKs use MSHTA to fetch and execute an initial PowerShell script from a remote server. 4. The script collects system info, takes screenshots, and sends them to the C2 server. 5. The C2 responds with commands to run additional PowerShell scripts or encrypted VBScript code. 6. These scripts set persistence and fetch next-stage payloads from the C2. 7. One payload is an infostealer that exfiltrates specific file types from local and remote drives. 8. The infostealer can also deploy extra scripts or binaries as directed by the C2 server. 9. The attacker leverages the access to pursue objectives within compromised Ukrainian networks.
