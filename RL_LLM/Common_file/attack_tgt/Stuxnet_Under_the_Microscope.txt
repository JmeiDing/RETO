1. Infects victim's system through compromised Siemens Step 7 project files. 2. Fingerprints the PLC system by parsing human designated symbol labels for devices. 3. Identifies the target is a Siemens 417 PLC controlling uranium enrichment centrifuges. 4. Constructs a special data block DB8061 to conduct the attack. 5. Monitors for the "DOWNLOAD" command to rebuild DB8061 if needed. 6. Enters attack states when enrichment process is at steady state for over 30 days. 7. Begins replaying normal sensor input signals to hide changes. 8. Closes valves controlling UF6 gas flow to centrifuges in cascades. 9. Opens valves to get low pressure sensor reading from attacked cascade. 10. Waits for pressure buildup before proceeding. 11. Further opens valves to maximize pressure. 12. Waits several minutes while preventing any state changes. 13. Resets PLC attack code to return to normal monitoring.
