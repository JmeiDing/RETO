1. The attack starts by sending the target a phishing message containing a malicious link. 2. When the user clicks the link, an exploit chain called Trident is triggered: Stage 1: A Webkit exploit (CVE-2016-4655) for initial code execution. Stage 2: Kernel info leak (CVE-2016-4656) to bypass kernel ASLR. Stage 3: Kernel exploits (CVE-2016-4657) to jailbreak the device. 3. The jailbreak installs the Pegasus spyware persistently and hides its icon. 4. The spyware exfiltrates data like messages, contacts, and passwords. 5. It can record audio, video, intercept calls and texts in real-time. 6. Pegasus uses encryption, obfuscation and stealth to avoid detection and can self-destruct if threatened.
