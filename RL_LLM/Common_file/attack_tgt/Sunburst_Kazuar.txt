 1. The Kazuar backdoor is developed and used in campaigns starting around 2015. 2. Kazuar is continuously improved over time, evolving its codebase and adding features. 3. In 2020, new Kazuar versions contain modified FNV-1a hashing and other algorithms. 4. The Sunburst malware is developed and used in the SolarWinds supply chain attack. 5. Sunburst shares code similarities with Kazuar like the modified FNV-1a hash and MD5+XOR victim ID algorithm. 6. The nature of the Sunburst-Kazuar code overlap is unclear - it could be same group, borrowed code, common source, etc. 7. Sunburst leverages the supply chain compromise to infect victims with a customized backdoor. 8. Post-compromise, Sunburst profiles systems, gathers data, and allows lateral movement. 9. New versions of Kazuar in late 2020 increase code overlap with Sunburst features. 10. More research is needed to uncover the relationship between the two malware families.
