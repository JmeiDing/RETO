1. MuddyWater sends spear-phishing emails with document attachments containing malicious macros. 2. If the victim enables macros, a malicious VBE file is dropped and executed. 3. The VBE file decrypts and executes obfuscated PowerShell code. 4. The PowerShell malware collects system info and saves it in a file. 5. It queries the C&C server to download and execute additional payloads. 6. Multi-stage backdoors like POWERSTATS allow further compromise through screenshots, command execution, PowerShell code execution, etc. 7. C&C communications occur via PHP scripts to control the compromised hosts. 8. The attackers can leverage the persistent access to launch additional attacks, steal data, etc.
