 1. The attackers send phishing emails containing malicious links to victims in target countries like Ecuador. 2. The links lead to a geo-checking server that analyzes the victim's location. 3. For target countries, it returns a password-protected RAR archive containing a PyInstaller executable. 4. The executable runs a Python script that executes an obfuscated mshta command to download a PowerShell script. 5. The PowerShell script checks the OS version and downloads an additional Powershell script. 6. The additional PowerShell disables security products, downloads Python, and creates scheduled tasks. 7. The scheduled tasks execute two Python scripts that deploy Meterpreter payloads communicating with a C2 server. 8. The Meterpreter payloads provide remote access, exfiltrate data, and further compromise systems. 9. The report also examines specifics on the malware obfuscation, evasion, persistence mechanisms, and C2 communications.
