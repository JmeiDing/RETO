 1. The attackers send phishing emails with malicious document attachments, often related to hotel reservations and targeting victims in Brazil. 2. The documents contain macros that execute a remote script using MSHTA. 3. The script loads a second stage script that creates a scheduled task to run MSHTA again. 4. The second script fetches and reflects a PowerShell command that loads the final CapturaTela malware payload from a remote server. 5. CapturaTela looks for specific web page titles indicating a credit card purchase window is open. 6. When found, CapturaTela takes a screenshot and emails it as a JPEG attachment to steal credit card info. 7. The malware also kills existing Chrome processes when finished.
