1. The attacker configures a Cobalt Strike listener to control command and control. Options include Beacon DNS, Beacon HTTP, Beacon HTTPS, Beacon SMB, Beacon TCP, etc. 2. The attacker generates an attack payload using one of Cobalt Strike's modules like raw shellcode, executable, HTML application, web delivery, signed applet, smart applet, or profiling. 3. The payload is delivered to the victim using the attacker's technique of choice such as phishing, drive-by-download, etc. 4. The victim executes or interacts with the payload, triggering the embedded Cobalt Strike code. 5. The payload establishes a connection back to the attacker's command and control server based on the configured listener. 6. Further exploitation, control, and data exfiltration occurs through the Cobalt Strike beacon payload that gets delivered and executed on the victim host. 7. Cobalt Strike modules utilize various techniques like reflectively loading binaries, disabling the Java sandbox, Vulnerability exploitation, and obfuscation. 8. The attacker manages infected hosts through Cobalt Strike's web interface and pivoting capabilities. 9. Talos analyzed the technical workings of each attack module and developed tailored Snort and ClamAV signatures to detect the attacks.
