1. MuddyWater sends spear phishing emails with macro-enabled Word documents as attachments. These docs pose as fake resumes or letters from ministries. 2. When the document is opened, a malicious macro executes automatically. It launches an Excel process and runs a PowerShell command. 3. The PowerShell command downloads a second stage PowerShell script from compromised domains. 4. The second stage script contains obfuscated VBScript, JavaScript, and PowerShell code. 5. The VBScript executes via WScript.exe to run the obfuscated JavaScript code using CScript.exe. 6. The JavaScript launches a PowerShell process that deobfuscates and executes the PowerShell backdoor POWERSTATS. 7. POWERSTATS uses various techniques for persistence, obfuscation, and UAC bypass on the victim's system.
