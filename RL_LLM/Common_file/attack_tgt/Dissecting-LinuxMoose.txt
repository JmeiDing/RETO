1. Linux/Moose spreads by scanning for nearby IP addresses and attempting to connect to devices over Telnet using default or weak credentials. 2. If Telnet access is gained, Linux/Moose gathers information about the device and sends it to a command and control (C2) server. 3. The C2 server returns obfuscated commands that are unscrambled and executed on the device to download and install the Linux/Moose malware. 4. Once installed, Linux/Moose contacts the C2 servers to obtain its configuration and initiate its malicious activities. 5. The malware scans and pivots through additional networks searching for more devices to infect. 6. It listens on TCP port 10073 for proxy connections from a whitelist of IP addresses under the operator's control. 7. The proxy service is leveraged to access social media sites and perform fraudulent actions. 8. Linux/Moose periodically kills other malware processes competing for system resources. 9. The malware can also hijack DNS settings during infection to enable future man-in-the-middle attacks. 10. Linux/Moose has no persistence mechanism, relying on credentials and IP knowledge to reinfect cleaned devices. 11. The malware communicates with multiple hardcoded C2 servers to retrieve configurations and send data stolen from infected networks.
