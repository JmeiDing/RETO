1. The threat actor sends a spearphishing email with a ZIP attachment containing a malicious LNK file. 2. The victim opens the LNK file, which triggers a chained execution flow: 3. The LNK runs a VBE loader script that drops and runs another VBE script. 4. The second VBE script extracts a CAB file containing Python scripts and libraries. 5. The CAB extracts and runs the Janicab VBScript implant. 6. Janicab sets persistence by adding a LNK file to startup and reaches out to the DDR to get the C2 IP. 7. Janicab receives commands from the C2 and can execute scripts, download files, capture screenshots and keystrokes, etc. 8. It uses Python scripts for proxying traffic, FTP serving local files, setting up SSH tunnels, etc. 9. A keylogger DLL is invoked to capture keystrokes and save them in encrypted log files. 10. The SSH tunnel is used to pivot into the network or exfiltrate data via the C2 server.
