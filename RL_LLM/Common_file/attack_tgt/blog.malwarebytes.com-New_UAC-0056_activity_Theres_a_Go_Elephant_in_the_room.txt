Here is the process of the attack described in the PDF document: 1. The attacker sends a phishing email with a macro-embedded Excel document to the victim. 2. The victim opens the Excel document which contains a malicious macro. 3. The macro executes and drops the first stage malware Elephant Dropper. 4. Elephant Dropper reaches out to the C2 server and downloads Elephant Downloader. 5. Elephant Downloader makes registry changes for persistence and drops Elephant Implant and Elephant Client. 6. Elephant Implant acts as a backdoor, communicating with the C2 to execute commands. 7. Elephant Client collects files and steals credentials, WiFi info, browser data, etc. 8. The stolen data is encrypted and exfiltrated to the attacker's C2 server. 9. The Elephant payloads use encryption and obfuscation to evade detection while carrying out the attack. 10. Through the malicious documents and payloads, the attacker gains persistent access to the victim system.
