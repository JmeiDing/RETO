 1. The attacker sends spearphishing emails with malicious links or attachments. 2. Malicious files exploit vulnerabilities or use social engineering to gain an initial foothold. 3. Older legitimate software is installed and used to side-load malicious DLLs. 4. The DLLs execute encrypted shellcode from .dat files to deploy payloads. 5. Mimikatz and other tools are used to dump credentials from compromised hosts. 6. The credentials are used with other hacking tools for lateral movement across the network. 7. RATs like PlugX and QuasarRAT are deployed via side-loading for persistent access. 8. Living off the land tools are used for host enumeration, credential dumping, and data theft. 9. AD snapshots are mounted to steal credentials and other sensitive data. 10. Exfiltrated data is sent back to attacker-controlled servers. 11.
