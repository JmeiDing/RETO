 1. Threat actors send phishing emails with COVID-19 themes and malicious attachments to target victims. The attachments are typically weaponized Office documents like Word, Excel, PowerPoint files. 2. If the document contains a template injection attack, upon opening, it fetches a remote malicious template that gets executed. The template usually contains a macro. 3. If the document contains a malicious macro directly, it gets triggered automatically when the document is opened. The macros are often obfuscated to evade detection. 4. The macro then extracts and decrypts an embedded executable payload or reaches out to download one from a remote server. 5. The decrypted payload is a malware module, commonly a remote access Trojan (RAT) or banking Trojan. 6. The malware module contains capabilities to collect sensitive information from the infected system, communicate with command and control servers, download additional modules, and allows remote control. 7. Finally, the infiltrated system's data is exfiltrated back to the threat actor's servers. The access can also be leveraged to move laterally within networks.
