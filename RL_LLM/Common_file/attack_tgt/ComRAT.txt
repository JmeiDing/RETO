 1. Turla operators gain an initial foothold on the victim's system through means like spearphishing or watering hole attacks. 2. They use this access to install and deploy the ComRAT malware, often using a PowerShell script. 3. ComRAT installs itself persistently using a scheduled task to regularly launch its orchestrator component. 4. The orchestrator injects the communications module into the default web browser process. 5. ComRAT connects to its command and control server over HTTP or via the Gmail web interface. 6. The operators send commands to gather sensitive documents from the victim's systems. 7. ComRAT compresses and encrypts any collected documents. 8. The documents are exfiltrated out to cloud storage services through protocols like HTTPS. 9. Turla operators retrieve the documents from the cloud services and can maintain persistent access to the victim. 10. If needed, additional malware tools can be deployed on the infected system for further control. 11. ComRAT is kept continually updated via its command and control channels.
