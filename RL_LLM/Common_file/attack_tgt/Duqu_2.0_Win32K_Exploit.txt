1. Trigger a use-after-free vulnerability in the Win32k component by registering a ClientCopyImage callback that destroys the Window object and unregisters the associated class. 2. Allocate a fake object in the freed memory location to control the memory layout. 3. Corrupt the cbclsExtra field of a tagCLS object using the HMUnlockObject call. 4. Use APIs like SetClassLong/GetClassLong with out of bounds indices to gain arbitrary read/write access to kernel memory. 5. Locate the tagWND object and overwrite its strName field to get full kernel memory read/write. 6. Bypass SMEP protection by modifying the PTE entry for the shellcode to change the access mode from user to kernel. 7. Achieve arbitrary code execution by overwriting a function pointer in the PALETTE object vtable to point to the shellcode. 8. Trigger the shellcode by calling the GetNearestPaletteIndex method which now points to the shellcode instead of the original function. 9. Execute the shellcode in kernel mode to achieve privilege escalation and compromise the system.
