1. The Hacking Team data breach leaks the zero-day vulnerability CVE-2015-5119 in Adobe Flash. 2. APT3 and APT18 identify the vulnerability and quickly incorporate it into their operations before a patch is available. 3. Both groups prepare phishing emails with links to exploit the Flash zero-day. 4. The phishing emails are sent to targets in various industries like aerospace, technology, etc. 5. Targets click the links which lead to malicious Flash files that leverage the zero-day. 6. For APT3, the Flash file downloads a backdoor malware called SHOTPUT which connects to hardcoded command and control servers. 7. For APT18, the Flash file installs a remote access trojan called GH0ST RAT which connects to a known APT18 command and control. 8. With access established via the exploit, the groups can further compromise targeted organizations through additional malware, lateral movement, and other techniques.
