1. The threat actor SWEED sends spear phishing emails with malicious attachments, typically ZIP archives, JAR files, or Office documents exploiting known vulnerabilities. 2. If the attachment is opened, it will download and execute a packed version of the Agent Tesla information stealing malware. 3. The malware uses various techniques like steganography, encoding, macro, etc. to evade detection and extract the final payload. 4. Agent Tesla is delivered onto the victim's system, often with the help of packers and UAC bypass techniques to gain persistence and elevate privileges. 5. The malware exfiltrates sensitive data from the infected system back to the attacker's infrastructure. Stolen credit card info is checked on IRC channels. 6. SWEED has used typosquatting and compromised legitimate sites for hosting malware and C2 infrastructure. The group targets companies globally across various industries. 7. The threat actor has been active since at least 2017 but does not exhibit strong operational security. TTPs rely on basic obfuscation of commodity malware.
