Here are the steps outlining the attack process used by Tropic Trooper: 1. Spearphishing emails containing weaponized Office document attachments are sent to targets. 2. The documents exploit vulnerabilities like CVE-2012-0158 when opened by the victim. 3. The exploit executes a dropper that decrypts and installs the malware payload, such as Poison Ivy. 4. The malware connects to command and control servers, often compromised third party systems, to receive commands from the attackers. 5. The attackers interactively explore the compromised system looking for valuable data. 6. The malware establishes persistence to survive reboots. 7. The attackers continue moving laterally through the network searching for further access.
