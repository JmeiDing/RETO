1. The attack starts with a spear phishing email containing a malicious zip file or Hangul Word Processor (HWP) document attachment. 2. The attachment exploits a vulnerability like CVE-2013-0808 to download and execute a payload, which is often the ROKRAT malware. 3. In some campaigns, the initial payload is a downloader that retrieves ROKRAT from a command and control server. 4. ROKRAT gathers system info like processes, OS details, cached web browsing history, etc. 5. It archives the collected data and encrypts it. 6. The data is exfiltrated to cloud storage services or sent to a command and control server. 7. ROKRAT can also receive additional commands from the attacker via the C2 server. 8. Some campaigns use multi-stage downloaders and installers to deploy ROKRAT from HWP or Office document exploits. 9. In 2018, a fileless version of ROKRAT was observed being loaded reflectively using process injection techniques.
