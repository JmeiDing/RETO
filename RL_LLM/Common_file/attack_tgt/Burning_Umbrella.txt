1. The initial infection vector is spearphishing, targeting IT staff, HR, and recruiting using job applicant emails and malware-laden resumes/documents. 2. If the phishing is successful, the malware will profile the victim system and deliver appropriate exploits or trojans, signed with valid stolen certificates, to gain an initial foothold. 3. The attacker spreads laterally on the network using stolen credentials and manual reconnaissance of shares and files. The primary goal is to find and exfiltrate code signing certificates. 4. Secondary goals involve manipulating virtual currencies or stealing data and intellectual property. 5. In some cases, the attacker uses other compromised organizations as proxies for unauthorized access to the target network. 6. Internal reconnaissance is performed by scanning for open ports 80, 139, 445 etc. to find internal web and file storage services. 7. Remote access is maintained via the attacker's own C2 infrastructure to obscure their true location. Operational security mistakes have revealed attackers origins in the Xicheng District of Beijing. 8. Newer campaigns rely more on phishing for cloud storage credentials rather than malware. Stolen files are then used to traverse and escalate access on the network. 9. High-value political targets are compromised later using the code signing certificates stolen from initial victims.
