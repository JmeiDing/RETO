1. Install initial downloader module in victim UEFI firmware using leaked HackingTeam bootkit VectorEDK. 2. Initial downloader executes on boot, drops IntelUpdate.exe payload to run at startup. 3. IntelUpdate.exe makes network connections to command servers to retrieve additional modules. 4. Modules use BITS, libcurl, WinHTTP to communicate with command servers. 5. Modules collect system information and exfiltrate it to command servers. 6. Later stages fetch tailored payloads sent via email attachments or downloaded from command servers. 7. Payloads consist of DLLs with simple exported functions to run commands and exfiltrate data. 8. Payloads gather documents, run arbitrary commands, and exfiltrate further data to command servers. 9. Modular framework can be extended by operators, updated over time. 10. Targets primarily in Middle East, decoy documents suggest political/espionage motives.
