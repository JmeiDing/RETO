1. StrongPity compromises software download websites using watering hole attacks. 2. The sites are modified to redirect targeted victims to malicious StrongPity servers when trying to download certain software installers. 3. The servers check the victim's IP address against a predefined list. If the IP is on the list, a trojanized version of the software installer containing malware is served. 4. The trojanized installer contains encrypted malicious components signed with a self-signed certificate to appear legitimate. 5. When executed, the installer drops multiple components on the victim system including persistence, command execution, and document exfiltration modules. 6. The command execution component connects to a multi-layered command and control infrastructure set up by StrongPity. 7. The C2 issues commands to extract documents from the infected system based on file extensions. 8. A file searcher component searches drives and archives identified files. 9. The files are encrypted and exfiltrated via the C2 channel to StrongPity servers. 10. The multi-layered C2 infrastructure hides the identity of the final StrongPity servers receiving the exfiltrated documents.
