1. The initial infection vector is not clear, but it results in installing the "Downeks" downloader on the victim's system. 2. Downeks makes a POST request to a command and control (C2) server, which instructs it to download and install the "Quasar" remote access Trojan (RAT) on the victim machine. 3. Quasar sets up communications with its C2 server located at app.progsupdate[.]com. 4. The attacker utilizes the Quasar RAT to issue commands and control the victim system, such as getting system info, downloading/uploading files, opening remote desktop, etc. 5. The researchers found vulnerabilities in the Quasar RAT server code that could potentially allow a second attacker to gain access and control of the original attacker's server using a "double edged sword" technique. 6. Downeks is used as a downloader to install additional payloads from its C2 server. It can also take screenshots, steal credentials, achieve persistence, etc. 7. The attack infrastructure shows links between Downeks campaigns, Quasar RAT, and previous DustySky campaigns - suggesting they may be conducted by the same group. 8. The attacks seem targeted, with decoy documents in Arabic and Hebrew, and occurrence during Middle East work weeks.
