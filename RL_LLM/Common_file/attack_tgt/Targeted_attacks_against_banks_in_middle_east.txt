1. The attacker sends emails with Excel docs containing malicious macros to bank employees. 2. The macro extracts and decodes base64 content from the Excel sheet. 3. The decoded content is dropped as a VBScript and PowerShell script on the system. 4. The macro creates a scheduled task to repeatedly execute the VBScript. 5. The VBScript uses PowerShell to download tools like Mimikatz and a custom BAT script. 6. The BAT script gathers system information like accounts, processes, etc. 7. The VBScript exfiltrates the data by encoding it in DNS subdomain names. 8. The macro unhides additional benign content in the Excel sheet after executing. 9. The multistage attack allows the attacker to gather intelligence on the bank's systems.
