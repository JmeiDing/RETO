 1. The attack starts with links posted on Hong Kong forums leading to compromised news sites with iframes. 2. The iframes exploit vulnerabilities in iOS 12.1 and 12.2 to trigger remote code execution. 3. The exploit downloads and installs the lightSpy malware modules. 4. The main light module acts as controller, loading additional modules from the C2 server. 5. Modules like dylib, KeyChain, Screenaaa, etc. extract data from the device. 6. Extracted data is exfiltrated to the C2 server. 7. The shellCommandaaa module can execute commands remotely from the C2 server. So in summary, it involves luring users to sites with exploits to install lightSpy, which then exfiltrates data and allows remote command execution via modules controlled by a C2 server.
