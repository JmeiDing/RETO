 1. The malware spreads via infected USB drives containing LNK shortcut files. 2. When executed, the LNK runs commands to download the main malware component as an MSI file from a remote server. 3. The main component uses extensive packing and obfuscation across multiple layers. 4. If sandboxing is detected, a fake payload is loaded to evade analysis. 5. The real payload injects code to connect to hardcoded Tor addresses via a custom Tor client. 6. The malware gains persistence and privileges by abusing Session 0 isolation and elevated COM objects. 7. The real payload receives data from the C2 server over Tor, but does not appear to utilize it yet.
