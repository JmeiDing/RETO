- Spear-phishing emails sent to targets, containing either malicious PDF attachments or links to download malware. The PDFs exploited vulnerabilities like CVE-2010-2883 to infect systems. - The malware payload was typically a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) like Poison Ivy. This allowed the attackers to gain remote control of infected systems. - Once infected, the malware would "beacon" out to command and control (C2) servers to receive commands. This beaconing had a specific pattern: -- Initial beacon was an HTTP GET request to a path like "/1.php" with encoded system info parameters. This pattern gave the group the "1.php" name. -- Later beacons evolved, moving the data to the URL path instead of parameters, likely to avoid signatures looking for the 1.php pattern. -- Recent beacons switched to using HTTPS and CONNECT requests to the C2 servers. - The C2 domains and IPs showed links between this campaign and previous suspected activity from the "1.php" group targeting government and defense entities. - Hostnames used for some C2 domains pointed to potential targets like QinetiQ. So in summary - it started with spear-phishing, then dropped malware to build a botnet, which beaconed out to C2 servers, likely to enable data exfiltration from victims. The attack patterns tie it to an APT group with prior suspected activity against sensitive targets.
