1. The Carbanak group conducted spear phishing campaigns targeting executives at financial organizations and professional services firms, primarily in the Middle East, United States, and Europe. 2. The phishing emails contained either malicious links or document attachments. 3. The malicious links led to exploit documents that leveraged vulnerabilities like CVE-2015-2545 to download malware payloads when opened. 4. The document attachments contained malicious macros that, when enabled, downloaded malware payloads. 5. The malware payloads were typically remote access Trojans (RATs) like Spy.Sekur, jRAT, and Netwire. 6. These RATs gave the attackers capabilities like stealing data, recording audio/video, logging keystrokes, and more. 7. The malware communicated with command and control servers to receive instructions and exfiltrate data from infected machines. 8. Technical analysis in the report uncovered overlaps in tactics, techniques, procedures, and infrastructure, indicating coordination between the actors distributing the different malware payloads. 9. The report concludes that the campaigns show the Carbanak group expanding its targeting and using new exploits and malware, demonstrating its continued threat.
