Here is a summary of the key points from the blog post: - Google's Threat Analysis Group discovered two North Korea-backed hacking groups exploiting a Chrome vulnerability (CVE-2022-0609) in February 2022. - The campaigns targeted US organizations in news media, IT, cryptocurrency, and fintech using phishing emails with fake job lures and malicious links. - One campaign is linked to Operation Dream Job targeting over 250 individuals at 10 organizations. The other is linked to Operation AppleJeus targeting over 85 in crypto/fintech. - The attacks used hidden iframes to trigger an exploit kit containing the Chrome exploit among other stages. Multiple safeguards were implemented to protect the exploits. - The exploit kit fingerprinted targets before delivering the Chrome exploit. Evidence suggests other exploits may have been served for Safari and Firefox users. - IOCs are provided including fake job domains, compromised sites, and exploitation URLs used in the campaigns. Technical analysis of the exploit kit is also included. - The exploit kit continued to be used after the Chrome vulnerability was patched on Feb 14, highlighting the need to promptly apply security updates. In summary, the post provides details on North Korean groups exploiting the latest Chrome zero-day in spear phishing campaigns, an analysis of their tactics and infrastructure, and stresses the importance of patching.
