1. APT3 sent phishing emails with links to compromised servers hosting JavaScript profiling code. 2. The servers profiled victims and served malicious Flash files exploiting an unpatched vulnerability. 3. The Flash exploit used heap sprays, vector corruption, and ROP techniques to bypass ASLR and DEP. 4. The ROP chain called VirtualAlloc to mark shellcode as executable. 5. The shellcode decrypted and executed the payload hidden in an image file. 6. The payload conducted further profiling, credential theft, lateral movement, and backdoor installation.
