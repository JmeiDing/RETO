1. The attackers pushed a scheduled task from the Active Directory to all machines via group policy. The task mimicked a legitimate Windows task. 2. The scheduled task downloaded a malicious CAB archive from an internal network share. This indicates the attackers had prior access and knowledge of the environment. 3. Extracted scripts from the archive checked for and attempted to disable Kaspersky antivirus if present. 4. The scripts extracted and executed additional stages, including Batch files and the final payload. 5. The Batch files disconnected the machine from the network and attempted anti-virus evasion. 6. A script deleted the boot configuration to corrupt the boot process. 7. The scripts changed local user passwords to a predefined pattern. 8. The final payload "Meteor" wiped files and folders specified in its configuration. It also deleted Volume Shadow Copies. 9. Meteor entered an infinite loop to persist on the system. 10. In parallel, a locker program was executed to lock the desktop and prevent user interaction.
