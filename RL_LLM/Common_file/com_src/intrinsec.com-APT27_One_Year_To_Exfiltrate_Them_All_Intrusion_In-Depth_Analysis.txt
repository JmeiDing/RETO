As a result, the company decided to contact CERT Intrinsec in order to get help to handle the security breach and manage the crisis. CERT Intrinsec gathered information about malicious activities that were discovered on victim’s information system, and past incidents. Our in- depth analysis led us to conclude that an advanced persistent threat dubbed APT27 (a.k.a LuckyMouse, EmissaryPanda) actually compromised the company’s internal network for more than a year by exploiting a public facing application. Our analysis showed that the threat actor managed to compromise five different domains and to gain persistence on many equipments while trying to hide in plain sight. Besides, APT27 operators collected technical and business-related informations and exfiltrate almost three terabytes of data. As investigations went on, we observed tactics, techniques and procedures that had already been documented in papers, but we discovered new ones as well. CERT Intrinsec wanted to share with the community fresh and actionnable threat-intelligence related to APT27. That is why this report presents a timeline of actions taken by the attackers and the tactics, techniques and procedures seen during our incident response. It provides as well a MITRE ATT&CK diagram and several recommendations to follow if you came across such incident, and to prevent them. CERT Intrinsec presentationCERT Intrinsec is a private French incident response team dealing between 50 to 100 major incidents per year and works to help its customers to recover from cyber-attacks and strengthen their security. Since 2017, CERT Intrinsec has responded to hundreds of security breaches involving companies and public entities. The majority of those incidents are related to cybercriminality and ransomware attacks with financial objectives, hence, Intrinsec follows those groups activities and generates comprehensive intelligence `from the field`. ANSSI (French National Security Agency) granted CERT Intrinsec PRIS (State-Certified Security Incident Response Service Providers) certification. The latter testify that CERT Intrinsec meets specific incident response requirements, using dedicated procedures, qualified people and appropriate infrastructures. Should you need our expertises, Intrinsec provides Incident response & Crisis services, Threat Intelligence services & datas, Detection services (SOC/MDR/XDR), supported by a large set of other services (pentests & audits, consulting, …) . APT27 PresentationAPT27 (a.k.a LuckyMouse, EmissaryPanda, Iron Tiger or Mustang Panda) is a supposed nation state cyber threat actor linked to RPC governement. Since at least 2010, the group has been reported1/15targeting numerous public organisations as well as private companies. Known APT27 sectors of interest are: Defense contractors, Aerospace, Telecommunication, Energy, Manufacturing, Technology, Education and finally governement’s data (ambassies has been reported targeted). The group is also well known for exploiting internet facing applications to get access within the victim’s networks. Known targeted application were MySQL, Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2019-0604 RCE), Apache Zookeeper and more recently Microsoft Exchange servers. In addition, the group is also known to rely on the HyperBRO malware, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT). Capabilities description and decryption tool are available on behalf of the report.Operation’s timelineAs the operation lasted at least one year, it is important to look at the timeline of malicious activities. The first activity discovered was the exploitation of a Microsoft Exchange server using ProxyLogon vulnerabilities chain and the domains discovery performed from this server. APT27’s operators then compromised five different domains in nine months, dumping credentials and gathering technical data about victim’s information system. After eleven months of activity, they started exfiltrating business- related data in archives using different means. Three terabytes of data were exfiltrated in 17 days. Attackers tried to hide their activities using many defense evasion techniques that we present to you in this report. The following timeline shows the different steps of the operation, especially regarding domains compromise and data exfiltration.2/15The following diagram summarizes APT27 modus operandi during the attack. It emphasizes intrusion vector, data exfiltration as well as command and control activities.3/15APT27 Techniques, Tactics and proceduresTechnique ID Technique NameExploit Public-Facing ApplicationTactic ID Initial Access T1190 Initial compromise is the adversaries actions performed to gain access of their target’s organisations. It can be performed by sending spear-phishing email or exploiting vulnerable internet facing applications to, then, move within the network. During CERT Intrinsec investigations, we found that on March, 4th of 2021, APT27 exploited ProxyLogon vulnerabilities chain affecting Microsoft Exchange server to gain initial access of the targeted organisation’s network. As a reminder, ProxyLogon related Microsoft advisory was initially published by Microsoft on March, 2th of 2021. First known information related to those CVE came back from december 2020, when DEVCORE Team discovered both CVE-2021-26855 and CVE-2021-27065. The exploitation of these two vulnerabilities leads to remote code execution with SYSTEM permissions, allowing attackers to drop webshells, for instance. Same initial intrusion date, also involving a successful ProxyShell exploitation as entry vector has been also reported by HVS-Consulting for one of their customer in their incident response report related to APT27. Many others security vendors also reported active exploitation of Microsoft Exchange Server on that date. We can assume that the threat group was aware of the vulnerability before the Microsoft4/15Advisory (or quickly developped an exploit) and managed to perform a massive exploitation campaign before companies had a chance to apply security fixes. ExecutionCommand and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell Windows Management InstrumentationTactic ID Technique ID Technique Name Execution T1059.001 Execution T1059.003 Execution T1047 Adversaries were wrapping their commands through calls to cmd.exe /Q /c command line. In addition, all results were stored int the ADMIN$ administrative share, in a file of type __[UNIX_EPOCH_DATETIME] This a likely the impacket’s behaviour and hence, Intrinsec CERT assumes that adversaries used that framework during their operation.

It is commonly achieved by deploying webshells, Remote Access Trojan or Remote Administration Tool, such as AnyDesk / Teamviewer.First payload found by CERT Intrinsec was the HyperBRO Remote Access Trojan. HyperBRO malware is a closed-sources application typical of APT27 threat group’s activities. HyperBRO is a fully featured Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and is used by APT27 operators to (not exaustive):Bypass UAC Execute local & remote commands Capture keyboard5/15Edit registry Manage files, process, servicesHyperBRO Malware descriptionHyperBro is a custom in-memory RAT backdoor used by APT27 and associated groups (Emissary Panda, Iron Tiger, LuckyMouse…) Once the HyperBro virus has infected a host, it’s used by APT27 to execute remote commands from it’s C2 server. HyperBro also includes features for taking screenshots, stealing clipboard content, modifying Windows services, editing the registry, and manipulating files (downloading and uploading, deleting, renaming).DeploymentFirst, a legitimate program (linked to CyberArk software) (vfhost.exe / msmpeng.exe) with a DLL side- loading vulnerability is used to load vftrace.dll (Initial loader / Stage 1). Then the loader will be able to decrypt thumb.dat (Stage 2) file, “encrypted” with a 1 byte key algorithm, decompress it and finaly extract the actual HyperBro backdoor (Stage 3) (compressed with lznt1 algorithm). The loader will then use the process hollowing technique to inject HyperBro backdoor (Stage 3) The HyperBro backdoor configuration is embedded into its own PE. At its first execution, the configuration is copied into the config.ini file and into the config_ registry key.6/15Known Paths%ProgramData%\windefenders\ %ProgramData%\windefenders\config.ini %ProgramData%\windefenders\msmpeng.exe %ProgramData%\windefenders\thumb.dat %ProgramData%\windefenders\vftrace.dll %ProgramFiles%\Common Files\windefenders\ %ProgramFiles%\Common Files\windefenders\config.ini %ProgramFiles%\Common Files\windefenders\msmpeng.exe %ProgramFiles%\Common Files\windefenders\thumb.dat %ProgramFiles%\Common Files\windefenders\vftrace.dllSOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\config_ HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\windefenders SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\windefenders HyperBRO ExtractorCERT Intrinsec made a tool to extract HyperBro configuration from Stage 2 samples.7/15This program is based on the work done on project HyperBroExtractor by HVS-ConsultingDescriptionThis tool is able to decrypt Stage 2 (thumb.dat), decompress and extract the actual hyperBro PE file(Stage 3), and parse the configuration it embeds. HyperExtractor will try to automatically bruteforce the 1 byte key and decrypt Stage 2, then it will decompress the LZNT1 compressed Stage 3 and extract the configuration. To work with as many samples as possible, this program uses patterns scanning to find configurations. In some cases the extraction of the configuration may fail but you can try to search for utf16 strings.

This operation was performed by executing a script that lists all domains in the selected forest, related domain controllers, computer’s names and versions and finally list of domain’s users and save it into a file named owa_font_[2-letters].css in the directory C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\Current\themes\resources\ : Below an exemple of data saved into the owa_font_[2-letters].css file: Microsoft (R) Windows Script Host Version 5.812 Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

They also used Remote Desktop protocol, to connect to computers within the targeted organisation’s network, and admin shares to move laterally. The targeted organization was managing numerous domains. APT27 operators managed to compromised them successively. a few months separated compromise of first domain and the second one. However, adversaries accelerated their operation and managed to get access to remaining domains in a few weeks interval.

In order to stealth authentication materials on compromised hosts, adversaries relied on the mimikatz tool. However, they tried to stay stealthly and used the sysinternal’s procdump tool, renamed in error.log to bypass Windows Defender detection and dump lsass process memory : C:\Windows\Temp\error.log -accepteula -ma lsass.exe c:\windows\temp\error.dmp Threat actors also used SysInternal’s PsLoggedon tool to search for specific account usage.

CERT Intrinsec also discovered a second application used to expose the targeted organisation’s internal network to adversaries. The application is a reverse SOCKS proxy written in GoLang called Chisel. It transports TCP/UDP traffic over SSH, which is encapsulated into HTTP. APT27 operators executed Chisel using wmic and rename it to veeamGues.exe to hide it in plain sight. The following command runs a server listening on port 9080 allowing clients to access the SOCKS5 proxy.

To do so, they used diruse command, as illustrated below. Operators then browsed directories in order to find personal information and data related to research and development, leveraging dir command and wmic to look for files on network shares. cmd.exe /Q /c wmic /node:[IP_ADDRESS] /user:[DOMAIN]\[USERNAME] /password:[PASSWORD] process call create cmd /c dir [DIRECTORY] > d:\$recycle.bin\1.txt 1> Once they found relevant data, they created password-protected archives using -t to test files after archiving, -inul to disable all messages, -hp to provide a password and -v to adjust size. wmic /node:[IP_ADDRESS] /user:[USER_ACCOUNT] /password:[PASSWORD] process call create “cmd /c c:\temp\rar.exe a c:\temp\temp.rar c:\temp\temp.dat -r -t -inul -hp[PASSWORD] -v[SIZE] cmd.exe /Q /c del rar.exe c:\windows\temp\rar.exe a -r -y -inul -[PASSWORD] g:\$recycle.bin\error.rar rar.exe a -r -y -hp[PASSWORD] -df error1.rar error.dmp error.log Besides, APT27 operators collected data about mailboxes on the Exchange server, using Get- Mailbox powershell command, as shown below : cmd.exe /Q /c powershell -c Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.Exchange.Management.PowerShell.SnapIn;Get- ExfiltrationApplication Layer Protocol: Web ProtocolsTactic ID Technique ID Technique Name Exfiltration T1071.001 After collecting business-related, personal and technical information from various servers, attackers used different methods to exfiltrate data. First, archives containing stolen data were moved to the Exchange server, in the Exchange folder C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\Current\themes\resources\, an easy way to exfiltrate data as this server had direct access to the Internet. These RAR archives were renamed with a .png file extension to hide in plain sight and try to avoid detection. Attackers then deleted them. By investigating files and Exchange server, CERT Intrinsec managed to carve some archives from disk images and retrieve passwords used to create the latter. It was then possible to know which data were exfiltrated by attackers. You can see below archives’ names created by the attackers prior to exfiltrating. .\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\Current\themes\resources\error1.png .\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\Current\themes\resources\error2.png .\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\Current\themes\resources\error3.png […] .\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\Current\themes\resources\error.part025.rar .\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\Current\themes\resources\error.part026.rar Attackers used HyperBro command and control server as well to exfiltrate WinRAR archives. Most of the exfiltration was carried out in 26 days and involve almost 3 tera bytes of data, from 4 different domains.13/15APT27 Intrusion SetThe following diagram sums up APT27 techniques, tactics and procedures.14/15Lessons LearnedDuring their operation, APT27 operators took advantage of security weaknesses in the victim’s information system and security management. CERT Intrinsec recommends monitoring network and endpoints activities. Indeed, supervising network equipments allows to track down malicious activities performed by advanced persistent threat, including command and control communications and exfiltration. Depending on your situations : XDR / MDR approaches combined with SOC and proper threat intelligence. During the investigation, firewall logs showed traffic peaks during exfiltration periods and could have been detected. Ensuring a proper log retention and storage is a good way to improve detection of malicious behaviour. Once entered the network, attackers moved laterally from server to server, from domain to domain, compromising each domain one after another. Many attacker’s actions were detected by in-place antivirus solutions as well : all of these highlight the needs of observation, process & people behind tooling, through your own teams or a specialized partner. Handling network, Active Directory hardening especially regarding trusts, and least privilege principle is very important to slow down attackers in the event of an intrusion. When compromising servers, particularly domain controllers, operators executed commands to collect credentials or to dump NTDS database, as well as to browse directories and remove tracks. Very useful information sources are available on systems and need to be monitored to spot attackers’ actions. These sources are Sysmon, that allows to log various events helping detection, and Microsoft Protection Logs where many evidences were found during the investigation. CERT Intrinsec published an article about this artefact and a parser to extract useful informations from it. You can read this article here. As explained previously, APT27 operators took advantage of a vulnerable Exchange server to enter the network. That shows the importance of keeping public-facing equipments up-to-date and managing vulnerabilities (support at leat by an external asset security monitoring approach to ensure a second line of defense in complexe / fast evolving environment). Last but not least, attackers leveraged weak passwords to compromise domain administrator account. It is, then, essential to ensure a strong password policy, separate admin accounts from user accounts and use good practices & means to manage authentications . External Resources15/15
