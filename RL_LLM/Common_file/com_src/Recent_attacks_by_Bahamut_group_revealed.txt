Recent attacks by Bahamut group revealedOriginal360 Beacon Lab360 Threat Intelligence Center2022-04-12 11:39Included in the topic #APT 56 #Bahamut 1 #cybermercenary 1BahamutBahamut is an advanced threat group targeting the Middle East and South Asia. It was disclosed and named by Bellingcat in 2017. Later, BlackBerry conducted a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the group and believed that the group was a cyberattack mercenary. The Bahamut group mainly uses phishing websites, fake news websites, and social networking sites to attack.Recently, we observed a suspected mobile terminal attack activity of this group. This attack activity started in January and used phishing websites to deliver mobile RAT samples. The RAT used in the attack belongs to a new family that has not been disclosed, and we speculate that it belongs to the group's unique attack weapon.1. Payload DeliveryWe monitored that the organization used its usual attack method - phishing website to deliver payloads. The phishing website pretends to be the introduction page of the secure chat software and provides a download link for the Android software. Through the domain name and certificate information of the phishing website, it can be known that the attack started in early January 2022 and is still active today .Figure 1 Phishing page2. Sample AnalysisFigure 2 Validity period of website certificateThe basic information of the sample is as follows: file nameMD5ed43605e6d85c7eab473c30ec 1b2271asecurechatnow_v1_0_7.apkPackage namescom.example.chatapplicationThe samples used in this attack are chat software with remote control function, and the chat function and remote control function are developed separately. The server address of the chat function and the C&C of the remote control function use the same address. In view of the same C&C address used for chat and remote control, and we have not found open source or open source code similar to this chat function and remote control function in the wild, we guess that this sample is an independently developed attack weapon. So far, the sample has not been identified by other security vendors.Figure 3 Screenshot of application runningFigure 4 Network configuration of chat and remote control functionsTheremotecontrolfunctionthe com.example.chatapplication.monitoring package . The malicious code is highly modularized and written with high quality, and uses a database to store various information. In addition to stealing common user privacy information such as text messages, contacts, and call records, it also uses auxiliary functions to focus on stealing chat information from a large number of well- known social software.is mainlycodeofthesampleinFigure 5 Malicious packet structureThe related commands and corresponding functions are as follows:instruction smsLogsFeaturesget whatsapp data Get telegram dataget imo data Get viber dataget facebook data Get conion data Get signal dataGet call historyget contactssteal text messages Get real-time locationget file list Get SMSUpload file or update operation3. Traceability and attributionAccording to the signature information of the samples from the same family, we have associated a sample suspected to belong to the B ahamut organization. The C & C format of the suspected sample is very similar to that of the sample analyzed this time. Both use random combination strings of numbers and letters. There is a URL with the same path ( /auth/login ) that shows the same login page . And among the samples of the same family of the suspected sample, there are two samples whose download address is jamaat-ul-islam.com, and the download address was disclosed by Blackbarry in 2020 and belongs to the Bahamut organization. Therefore, we attribute the attack samples discovered this time to the Bahamut group.Figure 6 Organizational AttributionFigure 7 The assets of the Bahamut group disclosed by Blackbarry4. Attack activity and victim analysisBy analyzing the creation time of the family sample and tracing the source of the sample, we found that the family sample first appeared in October 2020, and remained calm after a brief activity in February 2021, until it became active again in January this year , and is still active today. In the two active periods, different phishing websites were used for payload delivery.Figure 8 Active timeline of samples from the same familyBy querying the user infection status of the early samples of the same family, we found that the earliest infection time of the victim user was at the end of February 2021, which is consistent with the appearance time of phishing websites during the first active period. The geographical locations are mainly concentrated in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. They are also consistent with the main target of the Bahamut group.SummarizeThe ability to independently develop chat software and remote control Trojans, with clear code structure and high quality, shows that Bahamut's developers have a high level of development. At the same time, the development of Trojanized chat software, the use of random strings as C &C , and frequent phishing also show that the organization has strong camouflage and attack skills. During our follow-up of the Bahamut attack, several other family samples belonging to the group appeared, which shows that the group should have concentrated attack activities in the near future.
