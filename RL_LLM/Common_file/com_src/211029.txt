This data is provided in order to help cyber security professionals and system administrators to guard against the persistent malicious actions of cyber actors. This FLASH was coordinated with DHS/CISA. This FLASH has been released [select appropriate TLP level and remove others] TLP:WHITEWE NEED YOUR HELP! If you identify any suspicious activity within your enterprise or have related information, please contact the FBI immediately with respect to the procedures outlined in the Reporting Notice sectionof this message.Tactics, Techniques, and Indicators of Compromise Associated with Hello Kitty/FiveHands RansomwareSummary The FBI first observed Hello Kitty/FiveHands ransomware in January 2021. Hello Kitty/FiveHands actors aggressively apply pressure to victims typically using the double extortion technique. In some cases, if the victim does not respond quickly or does not pay the ransom, the threat actors will launch a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on the victim company’s public facing website. Hello Kitty/FiveHands actors demand varying ransom payments in Bitcoin (BTC) that appear tailored to each victim, commensurate with their assessed ability to pay it. If no ransom is paid, the threat actors will post victim data to the Babuk site (payload.bin) or sell it to a third-party data broker.TLP:WHITETLP:WHITE /Technical Details Hello Kitty/FiveHands ransomware uses compromised credentials or known vulnerabilities in SonicWall products (CVE-2021-20016, CVE-2021-20021, CVE-2021- 20022, CVE-2021-20023). Once inside the network, the threat actor will use publicly available penetration tool suites such as Cobalt Strike, Mandiant’s Commando, or PowerShell Empire preloaded with publicly available tools like Bloodhound and Mimikatz to map the network and escalate privileges before exfiltration and encryption.Indicators The following indicators were leveraged by threat actors during Hello Kitty/FiveHands ransomware compromises:SHA-256 a0281437a7efTLP:WHITEPAExec.exemy15.ps1 (Warprism)grabff.exegrbachrome.exespoolsv.exe9e63911b5b7e63023708125418d6d e52c08fa149SombRAT – SHA- 256 4de9dc28733dd22dabba678TLP:WHITETLP:WHITE /Information Requested The FBI does not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, or fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not guarantee a victim’s files will be recovered. However, the FBI understands when businesses are faced with an inability to function, executives will evaluate all options to protect their shareholders, employees, and customers. Regardless of whether you or your organization decides to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local field office. Doing so provides investigators and analysts with the critical information they need to track ransomware attackers, hold them accountable under US law, and prevent future attacks.The FBI may seek the following information:IP addresses identified as malicious or suspicious Recovered executable files  Live memory (RAM) capture  Images of infected systems  Email addresses of the attackers  A copy of the ransom note  Ransom amount  Bitcoin wallets used by the attackers  Bitcoin wallets used to pay the ransom  Post-incident forensic reportsRecommended Mitigations  Back-up critical data offline.  Ensure copies of critical data are in the cloud or on an external hard drive orstorage device. Secure your back-ups and ensure all data is not accessible for modification ordeletion from the system where the data resides.TLP:WHITETLP:WHITE / Use two-factor authentication with strong passwords, including for remoteaccess services. Monitor cyber threat reporting regarding the publication of compromised VPNlogin credentials and change passwords and settings, if applicable. Keep computers, devices, and applications patched and up-to-date.   Review the following additional resources:Install and regularly update anti-virus or anti-malware software on all hosts.o CISA’s analysis report and malware analysis report on FiveHandsransomware provide analysis of a threat actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures used in a successful cyberattack; indicators of compromise; and recommended mitigations to protect against, detect, and respond to potential FiveHands ransomware attacks.o The joint advisory from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UnitedKingdom, and the United States on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity provides additional guidance when hunting or investigating a network and common mistakes to avoid in incident handling.o The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency-Multi-StateInformation Sharing & Analysis Center Joint Ransomware Guide covers additional best practices and ways to prevent, protect, and respond to a ransomware attack.o StopRansomware.gov is the US Government’s official one-stop location forresources to tackle ransomware more effectively.If your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, the FBI and CISA recommend the following actions:Isolate the infected system. Remove the infected system from all networks, and disable the computer’s networking capabilities, including wireless and Bluetooth. Ensure all shared and networked drives are disconnected, whether wired or wireless. Turn off other computers and devices. Power-off and segregate (i.e., removefrom the network) the infected computer(s). Power-off and segregate any additional computers or devices that share a network with the infected computer(s), even if they have not been fully encrypted by ransomware. If possible, collect and secure all infected and potentially infected computers andTLP:WHITETLP:WHITE /devices in a central location, making sure to clearly label any computers that have been encrypted. Powering-off and segregating infected computers and computers that have not been fully encrypted may allow for the recovery of partially encrypted files by specialists. Secure your backups. Ensure that your backup data is offline and secured. Ifpossible, scan your backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free of malware.TLP:WHITEReporting NoticeThe FBI encourages recipients of this document to report information concerning suspicious or criminal activity to their local FBI field office. With regards to specific information that appears in this communication; the context, individual indicators, particularly those of a non- deterministic or ephemeral nature (such as filenames or IP addresses), may not be indicative of a compromise. Indicators should always be evaluated in light of your complete information Field office contacts can be identified at www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices. When available, each report submitted should include the date, time, location, type of activity, number of people, and type of equipment used for the activity, the name of the submitting company or organization, and a designated point of contact.Administrative Note This product is marked TLP:WHITE.
