Operation Double TapAPT3 (also known as UPS), the actors responsible for Operation Clandestine Fox has quietly continued to send waves of spearphishing messages over the past few months. This actor initiated their most recent campaign on November 19, 2014 targeting multiple organizations. The attacker leveraged multiple exploits, targeting both CVE-2014-6332 and CVE-2014-4113. CVE-2014-6332 was disclosed publicly on 2014-11-11 and is a Windows OLE Automation Array Remote Code Execution vulnerability. CVE-2014- 4113 is a privilege escalation vulnerability that was disclosed publicly on 2014-10-14.The use of CVE-2014-6332 is notable, as it demonstrates that multiple classes of actors, both criminal and APT alike, have now incorporated this exploit into their toolkits. Further, the use of both of these two known vulnerabilities in tandem is notable for APT3. This actor is historically known for leveraging zero- day vulnerabilities in widespread but infrequent phishing campaigns. The use of known exploits and more frequent attacks may indicate both a shift in strategy and operational tempo for this group.The SpearphishThe body of the message is below:One Month's Free Membership for The PLAYBOY ClUB 1080P HD VIDEOS 100,000 PHOTOS 4,000 MODELS Nude Celebrities,Playmates,Cybergirls & More!

This CVE is a local kernel vulnerability that, with successful exploitation, would give any user SYSTEM access on the machine.The malware component, test.exe, uses the Windows command "cmd.exe" /C whoami” to verify it is running with the elevated privileges of “System” and creates persistence by creating the following 1913. The malware sends the SOCKS5 connection request "05 01 00" and verifies the server response command "05 01 00 01 c0 b8 3c e5 00 51" and verifies that the first two bytes from the server are "05 00" (c0 b8 3c e5 is the IP address and 00 51 is the port in network byte order).Once the connection to the server is established, the malware expects a message containing at least three bytes from the server. These first three bytes are the command identifier. The following commands are supported by the malware:Command ID 00 00 0000 00 0100 00 02 00 00 0300 00 0400 00 0500 00 0600 00 07DescriptionContent after command ID is written to:C:\Users\ [Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\notepad1.exe Deletes the files:C:\Users\ [Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\notepad.exeC:\Users\ [Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\newnotepad.exe Malware exits Malware downloads the URL that follows the command ID. The file is saved to:C:\Users\ [Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\notepad.exe Content after command ID is written to:C:\Users\ [Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\notepad2.exe The files notepad1.exe and notepad2.exe are concatenated together and written to C:\Users\ [Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\newnotepad.exe and executed The contents of the following file is sent to the server:C:\Users\ [Username]\AppData\Local\Temp\note.txt The string following the command ID is executed using "cmd /C" and results are sent to serverLinks to APT3On October 28, we observed APT3 sending out spearphishing messages containing a compressed executable attachment.

The combination of this sustained operational tempo and lack of zero-day exploits may indicate that this group has changed strategy and has decided to attack more frequently and does not have steady access to zero-day exploit code. No matter the strategy, this actor has shown an ability to operate successfully.IOCs for this threat can be found here.
