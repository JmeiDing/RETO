This malware is used by an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group called APT36, a.k.a Transparent Tribe, which has been observed targeting the Indian Government and its Defence personnel.APT36, also known as ProjectM, Copper Fieldstone, Earth Karkaddan, is a Pakistan-based Threat Actors (TA) group. In the past, the APT36 group has launched a fake version of the Aarogya Setu Application for malicious purposes. Aarogya Setu is an application developed by the Indian Government to track COVID-19 cases.Our analysis indicates that upon successful execution, this malicious application can steal sensitive data such as contacts, call logs, SMSs, Location, take screenshots, record calls, and microphone audio, send SMSs, etc., from the victims’ devices. Technical Analysis APK Metadata InformationApp Name: Android Services Package Name: com.example.appcode.appcode communicates with the Command and Control (C&C) server hxxp://android.viral91[.]xyz/admin/webservices.2/11Figure 3 – App Communicates to C&CWe observed the similar domain hxxp://viral91[.]xyz had been used by Crimson RAT to target Windows machines. The TA behind Crimson RAT is also from APT36, which leads us to believe the same TAs are likely behind capraRAT.Manifest DescriptioncapraRAT requests the user for 21 different permissions, of which it abuses 12 permissions which are listed below.Permissions Access SMSs from the victim’s device. Intercept SMSs received on the victim’s device Access Call Logs Access phone contacts. Allows access to phone state, including the current cellular network information, the phone number and the serial number of the phone, the status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any Phone Accounts registered on the device. Allows the app to record audio with the microphone, which the attackers can misuse.RECORD_AUDIO ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION Allows the app to get the approximate location of the device network sources such as cell towers and Wi-Fi. The app allows the device’s precise location using the Global Positioning System (GPS). Allows an application to send SMS messages. Allows an application to initiate a phone call without going through the Dialer user interface to confirm the call.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE Allows the app to write or delete files to the device’s external PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS Allows the app to process outgoing calls and modify thestorage.dialing number.We observed that the defined launcher activity in the malicious app’s manifest file loads the application’s first screen, as shown below.3/11Figure 4 – Launcher ActivitySource Code ReviewOur static analysis indicated that the malware steals sensitive data such as Contacts, SMSs, Call logs, and location. Besides recording calls and microphone audio, the malware also deletes files, sends SMSs, makes calls, takes pictures from the camera, etc., based on the commands received from the C&C server.The method hideApp() showcases the code used by the malware to hide its icon from the device screen, as shown in Figure 5.Figure 5 – Code to Hide App IconThe listContacts() method has been used to access the contacts data such as phone numbers and emails from the victim’s device, as shown below.Figure 6 – Code to Collect Contacts DataThrough the listSMS() method, we identified that the malware collects SMSs from the device, as shown in the below figure.4/11Figure 7 – Code to Collect SMSsThe method listCallLog() depicts the malware’s ability to collect Call logs data from the device. Refer to Figure 8.Figure 8 – Code to Collect Call LogsThe code snippet shown in the below image depicts the methods getLocByGPS()and getLocByNetwork(), which are used to collect device location from both the GPS and the connected network.5/11Figure 9 – Code to collect Device Location DataThe image below highlights the malware code that takes screenshots of the device’s screen and sends them to the C&C server based on the command received from the TA.Figure 10 – Code to take Screenshots from the deviceThe image below shows the malware code to collect the device’s details such as phone number, IMEI, country code, operator details, etc.6/11Figure 11 – Code to collect Device InformationThe malware also captures the pictures from the device’s front and back camera without the user’s knowledge.Figure 12 – Code to Capture Images from Device CamerasThe method callRecording() shown in the below image depicts the malware’s ability to record calls.7/11Figure 13 – Code to Record CallsThe method micRecording() shown in the below image is used by the malware to record microphone audio from the infected device.Figure 14 – Code to Record using Device MicrophoneThe sendSMS() method can be used to send text messages. The TA’s C&C will provide details such as the recipient’s mobile number and message content.8/11Figure 15 – Code to Send SMSThe below code snippet demonstrates the method gaveCall(), which can be used to make calls on any number provided by TA’s C&C.Figure 16 – Code to Make CallsThe method updateApp() can be used to update the capraRAT malware.Figure 17 – Code to Update AppThe malware communicates with the malicious C&C server to receive the commands and sends sensitive information in response.Figure 18 – Malware’s Communication with C&C Server9/11We have listed the commands used by the TAs to control the infected device:Command Description smslogs Get SMS data smsstop Unregister SMS Service updateapp Update the Malware App capscreen Take Screenshots gavecall recordcal Call Record recordmic Mic Record deleteFile Delete Files sendsms Send SMSProcess Outgoing CallConclusionAPT36 has been active since 2013 and uses various sophisticated malware in its attacks. capraRAT is one such malicious Android application used by the group which can perform Remote Access Trojan activities with the potential to steal Indian Government personnel’s sensitive data, including contacts, call logs, SMSs, Location, audio recordings, etc.Given the sensitive nature of the data being accessed and the APT group suspected to be behind it, capraRAT could have severe national security implications for the Indian Diplomatic and Defense infrastructure.TAs constantly adapt their methods to avoid detection and find new ways to target users through increasingly sophisticated techniques. Such malicious applications often masquerade as legitimate applications to trick users into installing them. This situation makes it imperative for users to install applications only after verifying their authenticity. Apps should only be installed exclusively via the official Google Play Store and other trusted portals to avoid such attacks.Our RecommendationsWe have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:How to prevent malware infection?Download and install software only from official app stores like Google Play Store or the iOS App Store. Use a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices, such as PCs, laptops, and mobile devices. Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible. Enable biometric security features such as fingerprint or facial recognition for unlocking the mobile device where possible. Be wary of opening any links received via SMS or emails delivered to your phone. Ensure that Google Play Protect is enabled on Android devices. Be careful while enabling any permissions. Keep your devices, operating systems, and applications updated.How to identify whether you are infected?Regularly check the Mobile/Wi-Fi data usage of applications installed in mobile devices. Keep an eye on the alerts provided by Anti-viruses and your device OS and take necessary actions accordingly.10/11What to do when you are infected?Disable Wi-Fi/Mobile data and remove SIM card – as in some cases, the malware can re-enable the Mobile Data. Perform a factory reset. Remove the application in case a factory reset is not possible. Take a backup of personal media files (excluding mobile applications) and perform a device reset.What to do in case of any fraudulent transaction?In case of a fraudulent transaction, immediately report it to the concerned bankWhat should banks do to protect their customers?Banks and other financial entities should educate customers on safeguarding themselves from malware attacks via telephone, SMSs, or emails.
