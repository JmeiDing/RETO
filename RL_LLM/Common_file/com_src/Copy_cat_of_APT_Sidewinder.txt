It’s very strange for this group to compromise website an Indian school to target Afghanistan People.I think it’s not a fake website: url efaultaspx/197663174392792/NetworkThe second way, it’s the nomenclature of name. Usually, Sidewinder uses domains near of cdn names.The protocols of the hta file and the backdoor is completely differents.The backdoor used a text protocol without encryption<|MAINSOCKET|><|ID|>760–858–340<|>6042<|END|><|PING|><|PONG|> <|PING|><|PONG|><|SETPING|>62<|END|><|PING|><|PONG|> <|SETPING|>62<|END|><|PING|><|PONG|><|SETPING|>62<|END|><|PING|> <|PONG|><|SETPING|>62<|END|><|PING|><|PONG|><|SETPING|>62<|END|> <|PING|><|PONG|><|SETPING|>62<|END|><|PING|><|PONG|> <|SETPING|>62<|END|><|DESKTOPSOCKET|>760–858–340<|END|>The id of the victim is in the protocol unusual.Or Sidewinder use HTTP protocol for example:for the HTA if all checks are ok:GET /plugins/17285/93/true/true/and the backdoor:GET /ESmDEr7MDJw1r9jR9O4XGAVcBgCCySlZdmV3WU1J/17285/93/77223451/css HTTP/1.1ExecutionThe first stage of Sidewinder uses RTF exploits not an LNK in a Rar file.Another thing is the persistence with .bat, usually it’s the RTF exploit which create a Run Key.The side loading loads duser.dll which executes an exe itstr.exe coded in delphi which is the backdoor.url cat of APT Sidewinder ?.

In tweeter this weekend,@Timele9527… | by Sebdraven | MediumUsually, Sidewinder uses a dll like backdoor not a executable file.In the sequence of installation of the backdoor, this attack don’t use .NET serialization and it’s an important feature of the Sidewinder.About the BackdoorThe backdoor used is Allakore_Remote. It’s an opensource software written in Delphi.url found the same protocol.In this file url ain.pas we found many strings in the function FUN_0062ae18.Sidewinder don’t use open source usually.Threat IntelligenceThis attack is against Afghanistan and the society participate at the conference of ICC at Parisurl cat of APT Sidewinder ?.
