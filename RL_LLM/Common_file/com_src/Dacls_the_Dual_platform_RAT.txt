At ﬁrst glance, it seems to be just another one of the regular botnets, but we soon realized this is something with potential link to the Lazarus Group.At present, the industry has never disclosed the Lazarus Group's attack samples and cases against the Linux platform. And our analysis shows that this is a fully functional, covert and RAT program targeting both Windows and Linux platforms, and the samples share some key characters being used by Lazarus Group. The links between Lazarus Group and Dacls RAT First, we searched VT for the hardcoded string c_2910.cls and k_3872.cls in the sample and found 5 more samples. We can conﬁrm from their sample and C2 instruction codes that they by the user Raeezabdulla of the VirusTotal community, and cited a report "CES Themed Targeting from Lazarus". This sample also has download address of url . In October 2019, a sample named NukeSped was tagged by Twitter user @cyberwar_15 as Lazarus Group. url quick google returns many Lazarus Group analysis reports and some open source threat intelligence data, many pointing out that thevagabondsatchel.com was used by Lazarus Group to store samples.Therefore, we speculate that the attacker behind Dacls RAT is Lazarus Group.url the Dual platform RATCurrently this sample is shown on VirusTotal with 26 pretty generic malware tag from by 26 antivirus vendors with no relevant analysis report. Therefore, we think it is necessary to disclose some of its technical detail here.We name it Dacls (Win32.Dacls and Linux.Dacls) based on its ﬁle name and hard-coded strings. Dacls overview Dacls is a new type of remote-control software targeting both Windows and Linux environment. Its functions are modular, the C2 protocol uses TLS and RC4 double-layer encryption, the conﬁguration ﬁle uses AES encryption and supports C2 instruction dynamic update. The Win32.Dacls plug-in module is dynamically loaded through a remote URL, and the Linux version of the plug-in is compiled directly in the Bot program. Downloader server We found a series of samples on a suspected download server url agr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ , including Win32.Dacls, Linux.Dacls, the open source program Socat, and working payload for Conﬂuence CVE-2019-3396. We speculated that the Lazarus Group used the CVE-2019-3396 N-day vulnerability to spread the Dacls Bot ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, no section headerThe function of this sample is simple. It collects the target host information by specifying the parameters of the log collecting process. It avoids scanning some speciﬁed root and secondary directories, and write the retrieved ﬁle path to /tmp/hdv.log .Avoid Scanning Root Directory Avoid Scanning Secondary Directory /var/ypSample logging formaturl the Dual platform RATdeep name type size last date 0 / D 0 000000000000 1 bin D 0 201911290628 2 bash F 1037528 201907121226 2 bunzip2 F 31352 201907040536 2 busybox F 1984584 201903070712 2 bzcat F 31352 201907040536 2 bzcmp F 2140 201907040536 When all the work is done, it executes the system tar command to compress the log ﬁle tar - cvzf /tmp/hdv.rm /tmp/hdv.log and upload it to the speciﬁed log collecting interface. ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, for strippedThe main functions of Linux.Dacls Bot include: command execution, ﬁle management, process management, test network access, C2 connection agent, network scanning module. Initialization After Linux.Dacls Bot is started, it runs in the daemon mode in the background, and uses the startup parameters /pro , the Bot PID ﬁle, /var/run/init.pid and the Bot process name /proc/<pid>/cmdline to distinguish different operating environments. We suspect that it may be used for Bot program upgrades.url the Dual platform RATConﬁguration ﬁle .memcahce The Linux.Dacls Bot conﬁguration ﬁle is stored at $HOME/.memcache , and the ﬁle content is 0x8E20 + 4 bytes. If Bot cannot ﬁnd the conﬁguration ﬁle after startup, it will use AES encryption to generate the default conﬁguration ﬁle based on the hard-coded information in the sample. After successful Bot communicates with C2, the conﬁguration ﬁle will get updated. Data structure We deﬁne the data structure information of the conﬁguration ﬁle as struct_global_cfg, which stores the Bot operating parameters, C2 information, and plug-in information.url the Dual platform RATstruct struct_plugin_cfg_data char name[1040]; char content[2048]; char unk_array1[88]; int c2_num; struct_c2_content c2_list[3]; char unknown_filed_186C[14340]; struct_plugin_cfg_data plug_cfg_data_list[15]; AES encryption algorithmAES A0 D2 89 29 27 78 75 F6 AA 78 C7 98 39 A0 05 ED 39 18 82 62 33 EA 18 BB 18 30 78 97 A9 E1 8A 92Decrypting the conﬁguration ﬁle After decrypting the conﬁguration ﬁle, we can see some plain text information in it, for example: session ID, version information, reconnection time for C2, C2 information, etc. After successfully connecting to C2, the conﬁguration ﬁle will be updated according to received C2 instructions, such as adding new plugin information supported by the Bot, updated C2 information, etc.C2 protocolurl the Dual platform RATLinux.Dacls Bot and C2 communication is mainly divided into three stages, and uses TLS and RC4 double-layer encryption algorithms to ensure data communication security. The ﬁrst phase is to establish a TLS connection, the second phase is to establish agreement for authentication process (Malware Beaconing), and the third phase is to send RC4 encrypted data by Bot. SSL connectionPhase 2 Several Beacon messages and C2 conﬁrm each other's identity are exchanged here.Direction Encrypted DescriptionCmd BeaconRC4 encryption and decryption processRC4 Key generation algorithm, generated by random function, Key length range: greater than 0 and less than 50url the Dual platform RATReplacement table generation algorithm, generate replacement table for RC4 encryption based on RC4 KeyEncryption / decryption algorithm, complete encryption / decryption according to the replacement table generation algorithm. Because RC4 is a symmetric encryption algorithm, the encryption / decryption algorithm is consistenturl the Dual platform RATRC4 decryption example After completing the protocol authentication, Bot sends the RC4 Key length (the ﬁrst 4 bytes) and RC4 Key data to C2.C2 receives the encryption key and sends the ciphertext to Bot. After decryption, the command is 0x00000700. After that, Bot will upload the hostname-related information to C2.Key: a3 2f c2 10 f3 92 79 c3 0e f6 e4 e5 2e 69 29 86 0d 3a 92 f5 b7 23 fc 91 d9 46 91 55 a3 86 5a 47 36 1d 58 2a af d1 6d 3d 49 52 23 77 bc 4d fd 49 fe 3c 2c d7 bf 08 e3 91 d7 00 1f d0 00 07 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 C2 instruction code table The instructions accepted by Linux.Dacls Bot are a total of 12 bytes, but the actual effective size is 4 bytes, and it is divided into two control modes.The ﬁrst mode: when the third byte is 0, this is to control the Bot main logic.The following is an example of the network sequence data packet corresponding to the 0x00000700 instruction: the mode is 0x00, and the instruction 2 is 0x07 to control Bot to upload host name informationurl the Dual platform RATINSTRUCTION 1 INSTRUCTION 2 MODE UNKNOWN 00000007The second mode: when the third byte is 1, the plug-in logic is called.The following is an example of the network sequence data packet corresponding to the 0x00010101 instruction: the mode is 0x01, and the instruction 1 is 0x01.INSTRUCTION 1 INSTRUCTION 2 MODE UNKNOWN 01010001After receiving the instruction, Bot returns 0x20500 on successful execution and 0x20600 on failure.C2 instruction list for the Bot main logic partMOD‐ 0x00000602 Yes0x00000700 Yes 0x00000900 YesDescription Upload C2 conﬁguration information Download conﬁguration information to $HOME/.memcache Ask Bot to upload host information Ask Bot to send heartbeat informationC2 instruction list for the Bot plugin logicEN‐ CRYPT DescriptionExecute the bash command issued by C2 Connect to the speciﬁed C2 and execute the issued system command Scanning the directory structure Download ﬁle from speciﬁed url Scan and upload information about the host 0x00010002 Yes0x00010100 Yes 0x00010200 Yesurl the Dual platform RATEN‐ CRYPT DescriptionCMD 0x00010201 YesKill speciﬁed process0x00010202 YesCreate a daemon process0x00010204 YesObtain and report process PID and PPID0x00010300 Yes 0x00010400 YesTest whether the speciﬁed IP can be reached C2 Connection proxyMODULE 0x00011101 YesTest if the Log server can be accessed Upload public network port scan results and command execution output No operationlogsend0x00011102 Yesurl the Dual platform RATC2 communication ﬂowcharturl the Dual platform RATurl the Dual platform RATPlug-in module Linux.Dacls Bot uses static compilation to compile the plug-in and Bot code together. By sending different instructions to call different plug-ins, various tasks can be completed. The sample we analyzed contains a total of 6 plugins, because the conﬁguration information of the plugin is a continuous array of structures (0x00 ~ 0x0e). We guess that Bot may have other more plugins.Each plug-in has its own corresponding conﬁguration, which is saved in the bot’s conﬁguration ﬁle $HOME/.memcache . When the plug-in is initialized, the conﬁguration information will be loaded. Bash plugin The Bash plug-in is plug-in number 0, it mainly supports two functions: receiving and executing system commands issued by the C2 server; C2 issues temporary new C2, bot then connects to the temporary C2 and executes system commands issued by the temporary C2.File plugin The main function of the File plugin is ﬁle management. In addition to supporting read, write, delete, and ﬁnd operations on ﬁles, bot can also download ﬁles from a designated download server.url the Dual platform RATProcess plugin The main function is process management, including: killing a speciﬁed process, creating a daemon process, obtaining the PID and PPID of the current process, and obtaining process list information.If the /proc/<pid>/task directory corresponding to the PID in the Linux process exists, the Bot sample will collect the following process information:/proc/<pid>/cmdline Read full name from command lineurl the Dual platform RATFrom /proc/<pid>/status reading:Name //process name Uid //user ID Gid //group ID PPid //parent ID Test plugin The main function is to test network connectivity by connecting the IP address and port speciﬁed by C2.Reverse P2P plugin The Reverse P2P plug-in is actually a C2 Connection Proxy, it directs network trafﬁc between bots and C2 to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure. This is a common used technique by the Lazarus Group. With connection proxy, the number of target host connections can be reduced, and the communication between the target and the real C2 can be hidden. In some cases, an infected intranet host can be used to further penetrates into the isolated network segment.reverse_p2p plugin initializationWhen Bot receives a command, it ﬁrst attempts to connect to the speciﬁed C2 port to send a 0x21000. If C2 returns 0x21300, the C2 connection is successful and the Bot will connect to the target IP:port. If it works, it will return 0x21100 to C2, indicating that the forwarding connection has been established and can start forwarding data. Now, Bot can forward the data sent by C2 to the target, and at the same time return the data returned by the target to C2, until either party interrupts the connection.url the Dual platform RATThe following is the working ﬂowchart of the Reverse P2P plugin:LogSend plugin The LogSend plug-in mainly includes three functions: test the connection to the Log server, randomly scan the entire network's 8291 port and report to the Log server, execute system commands that take a long time and report the console output to the Log server in real time.LogSend plugin initializationurl the Dual platform RATLogSend related operation callback functionAfter testing the connection to the Log server, the Bot will send a test request to the Log server. If the Log server returns {"result":"ok"} , indicating that the test was successful, C2 can issue more LogSend instructions.Sending the POST request using the HTTP interface address speciﬁed by C2 and the built-in User-AgentPOST /%s HTTP/1.0 Host: %s Content-Length: 9 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/65.0.3325.181 Safari/537.36 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Cache-Control: no-cache Connection: close log=checkRandomly scan port 8291 on the entire network and report the result to the Log server.After receiving the instruction, Bot will randomly generate a public IP address according to 3 built- in rules and try to connect to their port 8291. If the connection is successful, the scan result will be returned to the log server.IP generation rules:ip = <part1>.<part2>.<part3>.<part4> rule1: part1 != 127 rule2: part1 == 172 and (part2 <= 15 or part2 > 31) rule3: part1 != 192 and part2 != 168 rule4: part1 != 10The random IP generation algorithm is as followsurl the Dual platform RATWe can see that Bot hard-codes the TCP / 8291 port and calls the system connect function to perform port scan. It only checks whether the port is open and does not send payload data. We are not sure why TCP 8291 is targeted, but we know that the Winbox protocol of the MikroTik Router device works on TCP / 8291 port and is exposed on the Internet. Previously we also disclosed 2 articles about the TCP / 8291 port threat incident [1][2].url the Dual platform RATExecute bash command which takes a long time to ﬁnish and report the console output to the Log server in real time.url the Dual platform RATExecute the bash command and forward the output to the Log server. All reported Log data is submitted by HTTP POST. The format of the payload section is as follows: log=save&session_id=<session id>&value=<log content>url the Dual platform RATSuggestions We recommend that Conﬂuence users patch their system in a timely manner and check whether they have been infected based on the process name, ﬁle name, and TCP network connection used by Dacls RAT.We recommend that readers monitor and block Dacls RAT-related IPs, URLs and domain names.
