The name of the Word file is shown below. The term ‘KIMA’ mentioned in the filename is the name of the monthly magazine specializing in the field of security, national defense, and military, published by Korea Institute for Military Affairs.March Monthly KIMA Paper_Requirements.docThe attacker performed spear-phishing attacks targeting professors of certain universities. Figure 1 shows the macro feature and overall operation method of the malicious word file: downloading additional commands (Visual Basic Script) and executing them from memory.1/5Figure 1. Word file’s attack flowThe way the executed VBS code communicates with the attacker’s C&C server is similar to the method introduced in the previous ASEC blog post (APT Attacks Using Malicious Word File of a Particular Thesis).APT Attacks Using Malicious Word File of a Particular Thesis2/5Figure 2. Part of the macro code for March Monthly KIMA Paper_Requirements.docThe VBS code downloaded from the attacker server obtained during the time of the analysis collects and leaks the following information from the user PC.3/5Figure 3.

It then registers a service disguised as that of Microsoft to run the script. This is thought to maintain the persistence of running the script. The registered service waits for the commands from the attacker server in a method similar to that of the word macro feature initially run.Figure 4.
