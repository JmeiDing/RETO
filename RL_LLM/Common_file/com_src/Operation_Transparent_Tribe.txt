Introduction Proofpoint researchers recently uncovered evidence of an advanced persistent threat (APT) against Indian diplomatic and military resources. Our investigation began with malicious emails sent to Indian embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakstan but turned up connections to watering hole sites focused on Indian military personnel and designed to drop a remote access Trojan (RAT) with a variety of data exfiltration functions. Our analysis shows that many of the campaigns and attacks appear related by common IOCs, vectors, payloads, and language, but the exact nature and attribution associated with this APT remain under investigation. At this time, the background and analysis in this paper provide useful forensics and detail our current thinking on the malware that we have dubbed “MSIL/Crimson”. Attack against Indian Embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan On February 11, 2016, we discovered two attacks minutes apart directed towards officials at Indian embassies in both Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan. Both e-mails (Fig. 1, 2) were sent from the same originating IP address (5.189.145[.]248) belonging to Contabo GmbH, a hosting provider that seems to be currently favored by these threat actors. The e-mails also likely utilized Rackspace’s MailGun service and both of them were carrying the same exact attachment. Emails: gov.in> exploit: CVE-2012-0158 Doc dropped: functionality: downloader Author: Darien Huss Figure 1: First email sent to Embassy of India, Astana, Kazakhstan Figure 2: Second email sent to Embassy of India, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia In this incident, the attachment was a weaponized RTF document utilizing CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded, encoded portable executable (PE). To decode the embedded PE, the document’s shellcode first searches for the 0xBABABABA marker that, when found, will indicate the beginning position of the PE (Fig. 3). The PE is then decoded using the key 0xCAFEBABE while skipping null DWORDs (Fig. 4). A final marker indicates the end of the PE file, which, in this case, is the marker 0xBBBBBBBB. This decode routine, including other components of the exploit document, have been discussed before and have been observed in completely unrelated incidents. Figure 3: Shellcode searching for 0xBABABABA marker Figure 4: Decoding of encoded PE and searching for terminator marker After successful exploitation and decoding of the embedded payload, a family of malware we refer to as MSIL/ Crimson will be executed on the victim’s machine. The first stage in infection is a downloader whose purpose is to download the more fully featured RAT component. The MSIL/Crimson downloader that was dropped (md5: description and analysis of the MSIL/Crimson malware family is provided in the Technical Analysis section. Figure 5: MSIL/Crimson downloading RAT Fake blog with an Indian military emphasis leads to MSIL/Crimson and more While conducting research related to MSIL/Crimson, Proofpoint researchers discovered a malicious blogspot.com site (Fig. 6), intribune.blogspot[.]com, that appears to have been set up to lure Indian military officials into becoming infected with MSIL/Crimson, njRAT, and possibly other malicious tools. This site is likely operated by the same actor(s) that carried out the previously discussed attacks on Indian embassy officials based on shared C&C infrastructure as discussed in the Cluster Analysis section. Most of the published stories contain some method of directing potential victims to a malicious payload, although a few of the stories did not contain any malicious code at time of analysis. In the following articles from this site, we see the threat actors conducting their malicious activities in multiple ways: 1. Using hyperlinks via an image or text 2. Using the same hypertext link in the article text, on the story’s image, and in an iframe 3. The final article in this section contains a link to an additional website that is likely operated by the same threat actor(s) and connected to other email campaigns Lure articles 4 Sikh Army Officers being trialed in military court on alleged involvement with KLF Link: hxxp://intribune.blogspot[.]com/2015/11/4-sikh-army-officers-being-trialed-in.html Malicious Document Location: hxxp://bbmsync2727[.]com/news/4%20Sikh%20Army%20Officers%20being%20trialed.

This iframe causes visitors to be prompted to download the document immediately upon visiting, as well as from the top level of the malicious website.

This website is likely operated by the same actor(s) and is capable of delivering a VBS-based malicious document to unsuspecting victims (Fig. 15). Again, there is an obvious India-targeted theme that suggests this malicious website is specifically targeted at that nation. After using the number submission form, victims are directed to another page containing the final link to download a malicious document (Fig. 16).

The spreadsheet is themed towards the Armed Forces Officials Welfare Organization (AFOWO) located in India, while the dropped downloader and downloaded RAT communicate with the same C&C as many of the previously discussed samples. An Excel spreadsheet named “AFOWO Broucher 2016.xls” (hash: payload from hxxp://afgcloud7[.]com/com/psp.dlc . Additionally, the IP address (50.56.21[.]178) resolved from email. books2day.com (used in the embassy attacks). This IP has also recently resolved to email.afowoblog[.]in. We would not be surprised if an email address using @afowoblog.in was used to send the malicious “AFOWO Broucher 2016.xls” spreadsheet. Additional research related to this domain is provided in the Cluster Analysis section. Downloader) module capable of downloading the full MSIL/Crimson RAT and all subsequent modules. Additionally, this payload drops decoy document contains information regarding a possible Brigadier General whose last and current position (according to the decoy) is the Chief of International Military Affairs Department Ministry Defence (sic) of Afghanistan. Cluster Analysis In this section we will present our research surrounding the use of the MSIL/Crimson implant and campaigns that are part of Operation Transparent Tribe. Even though the tool may possibly be used by several threat actors, our research indicates that the hundreds of Crimson samples may be clustered into a much smaller set of activity as described below. Cluster 1 - Operation Transparent Tribe and More The first cluster is the largest with activity from over one hundred samples dating as far back as 2012 (Fig. 18). For this cluster, we started our analysis beginning with the email attacks on the Indian embassies and the fake Indian news blog. The activity surrounding those two events uncovered numerous other samples hosted on attacker-controlled C&C that then lead to at least one additional email attack campaign. On one of the C&Cs we discovered a Python-based RAT (Python/Peppy) whose activity very closely clusters to Operation Transparent Tribe. We have also observed this RAT being downloaded and executed along with MSIL/Crimson by Andromeda downloaders. In addition to Crimson and Peppy, we have observed the usage of Luminosity Link RAT, njRAT, Bezigate, Meterpreter, and several custom Figure 18: Maltego graph of cluster 1 activity (click here for the complete graph) The attackers responsible for this activity appear have to used a mixture of compromised infrastructure (e.g., sahirlodhi[.] com) and infrastructure owned solely by them (e.g., bbmsync2727[.]com). In many cases, the attackers used common patterns in naming their domains: • sync in domain name and file name • Repeated use of bb in domain name or filename, mostly bbm • Ending second level domain names in four digits Additionally, this cluster of activity has numerous instances where Contabo GmbH was used for C&C. However we never used that as a sole item to group activity together under this cluster. Next, we will discuss an additional email attack, the attachment.biz activity, and lastly the afowoblog.in domain, all of which we believe fall into this cluster. Email campaign using “2016 Pathankot attack” Lure While researching this activity, we discovered an additional email attack campaign using the 2016 Pathankot attack as a lure (Fig. 19). This attack utilized a URL (hxxp://comdtoscc.attachment[.]biz/?att=1451926252) to deliver a compressed their C&C. Figure 19: email campaign using “2016 Pathankot attack” as a lure The attackers further increased the believability of their attack by including decoy files with each of the MSIL/Crimson payloads: Original name: “Call Record and Tracking Route.scr” Decoy name: “Call Record and Tracking Route.mp3” Figure 20: Audio file decoy, likely discussing Pathankot attack Original name: “detail behind the scenes.scr” Decoy name: “detail behind the scenes.pdf” Figure 21: Pathankot attack decoy ATTACHMENT.BIZ domain We discovered additional activity surrounding the attachment.biz domain that is being used to deliver malicious documents and payloads. The observed domains include: • fileshare.attachment[.]biz • comdtoscc.attachment[.]biz • ceengrmes.attachment[.]biz • email.attachment[.]biz (no links discovered) All of the domains resolve to the same IP, 91.194.91[.]203 (Contabo GmbH). So far we have detected three separate campaigns, although we’re unsure of the starting point for each of these incidents but are highly confident they exist in this cluster of activity. Link 1: hxxp://ceengrmes.attachment[.]biz/?att=1450603943 Payload name: Accn Letter.scr C&C: 5.189.143[.]225:11114 Link 2: hxxp://fileshare.attachment[.]biz/?att=1455264091 Payload name: Air India Valid Destinations.xls *Same payload as delivered by hxxp://fileshare[.]attachment[.]biz/?att=1455255900 from the attacker’s cdrfox.xyz site Link 3: hxxp://comdtoscc.attachment[.]biz/?att=1453788170 Payload name: Message.zip Decompressed payload name: Message.scr C&C: 193.37.152[.]28:9990 AFOWOBLOG.IN Domain We have uncovered circumstantial evidence indicating that the afowoblog.in domain falls into this cluster of activity. The domain was registered on or near February 24th, 2016 using the email address thefriendsmedia@gmail.com, which is also close to the same day that the “AFOWO Broucher 2016.xls” attachment was uploaded to VT. We have detected potentially connected activity as far back as June 2013 using the domain thefriendsmedia[.]com , where it was used as an Andromeda C&C. In one instance (Fig. 22, maltego graph), we observed an Andromeda payload communicate with brooksidebiblefellowship[.]org to retrieve an additional Andromeda payload from lolxone[.]com that then used thefriendsmedia[.]com as its C&C. The original Andromeda also retrieved a Bezigate payload. Figure 22: thefriendsmedia connection to Andromeda, lolxone[.]com, and Bezigate Furthermore, we have observed lolxone[.]com hosting additional Bezigate payloads as well as the Python/Peppy malware as shown in the graph below (Fig. 23). This activity can be further connected to the overall cluster via the Peppy, Bezigate, and Andromeda C&Cs as shown in the complete Maltego graph (Fig. 25). Figure 23: lolxone[.]com and Andromeda connections to Python/Peppy, Bezigate Cluster 2 - guddyapps/appstertech/sajid Some Crimson SecApp modules we came across did not download the expected RAT or downloader payload when it from 178.238.228[.]113:7861 . Once the downloader was executed, it then downloaded an XMPP library (md5: refer to as Beendoor. Beendoor is a very interesting piece of malware and we were able to gather additional information about this variant's C&C, 178.238.235[.]143. Much like Crimson and Peppy, Beendoor is capable of taking screenshots of the victims desktop. On Beendoor’s C&C we were able to recover a screenshot that appears to have been taken from one of the malware developer’s computer (Fig. 24). In this modified screenshot we are bringing attention to a few key pieces of information: • Identical “Anushka” image on desktop found on Beendoor C&C and used in Beendoor sample • Folder structure similar to that found on the C&C • Same file names used by Beendoor and the XMPP library Figure 24: Screenshot of likely Beendoor developer’s desktop As shown in the figure, it seems likely that the Pakistan-based company Appstertech is somehow connected to the Beendoor malware. Based on the analysis of the folders and files on the Beendoor C&C, we can also conclude that this activity is related to research published by CloudSek late last year. In the Crimson samples that we found connected to Beendoor (Fig. 25), several of them used the same “Binder” dropper that we observed in other clusters, including Cluster 1. Moreover, the C&C for this occurrence of Crimson and Beendoor are both hosted at Contabo GmbH, another similarity with other clusters surrounding the Crimson implant. Figure 25: Maltego graph of Crimson<->Beendoor cluster Cluster 3 - “Nadra attack in Mardan” Lure In addition to the attack using the recent Pathankot attack as a lure, we discovered several samples that may have been used in recent attack campaigns utilizing the December attack in Mardan near a National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) as a lure. Several samples were uploaded to VT in compressed archives containing Crimson payloads along with possible decoys their respective droppers would have dropped. For example, medium/2015/12/56825d6d8f1a5.png which is linked to by an article about the attack: hxxp://www.dawn[.]com/ news/1229406 For this cluster of activity, we’re not currently aware of any droppers and so have decided to cluster it on its own. With that in mind however, the TTPs for this campaign are nearly identical to the “Pathankot attack lure” campaign in Cluster 1. Unsurprisingly, the C&C utilized in this campaign is hosted at Contabo GmbH. Lastly, the port used in these samples, 11100, is the same port used by some of the samples we have grouped in Cluster 1. Threat Insight | Operation Transparent Tribe Cluster 4 - DDNS and Pakistan The final cluster we would like to discuss include several samples all using DDNS for their C&C pointing to Pakistan IP (according to Whois) addresses. The majority of this activity is from 2013. Based on the slightly different TTPs (purely DDNS usage) and no use of Contabo GmbH, we have clustered this separately from other activity, even though we have observed DDNS usage in Cluster 1 and the obvious overlap in tool usage. This activity is graphed in Figure 26 and included in the IOCs section. Figure 26: DDNS and Pakistan IP address Maltego graph One Cluster to Rule Them All, Nothing Yet to Bind Them There are numerous overlaps between the clusters, including usage of the “Binder” dropper, attack lures, and most obvious, the usage of Contabo GmbH. Unfortunately we lack information regarding some of the found samples as far as how they were used and in what campaigns, and so we have decided not to tie all the activity together. As we continue to research these incidents, we would not be surprised to find additional information linking all clusters together. Crimson is modular in the sense that additional payloads downloaded by the main RAT module are often utilized to perform functions such as keylogging and browser credential theft. Crimson infections also typically occur in stages. Crimson’s first stage is a downloader component whose primary purpose is to download a more fully featured RAT, typically being the Crimson RAT component. The RAT component will then send system information to the C&C while the C&C will likely respond with additional module payloads. Crimson utilizes a custom TCP protocol for communicating to C&C (Fig. 27). Some of Crimson’s optionally downloaded modules have no C&C capability and instead rely on the RAT component for information exfiltration. Figure 27: Crimson custom TCP C&C protocol Crimson-infected victims may be spied on by their attackers via invasive methods such as through their webcam, stealing email from Outlook, and recording their screen. Some Crimson RAT variants support at least 40 individual commands, while all the individual commands throughout the different versions of the RAT we researched are listed and described in Table 1.

These modules include keylogging, browser credential theft, automatic searching and stealing of files on removable drives, and two different payload update modules. Lastly, there appears to be a module referred to as “remvUser” that we have not been able to locate. URLDownload When executed, this module will first check for the existence of a registry key: HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\ CurrentVersion\last_edate . If the key does not exist then it will be created by the module and assigned a DateTime.Now string. This key is periodically checked for how many days have passed. Once the malware detects that at least 15 days have passed, a HTTP GET request is sent to a hardcoded location to retrieve a text file that should point to another HTTP contained a hardcoded URL: hxxp://sahirlodhi[.]com/usr/api.txt. So far we have observed the attackers modify api.txt twice, first containing a link to: hxxp://bbmsync2727[.]com/upd/secure_scan.exe and then: hxxp://bbmsync2727[.]com/ ccmb/ssm.exe . In the module that we analyzed, the downloader logic was configured to request a file from a hardcoded URL: hxxp:// sahirlodhi[.]com/usr/api.txt , which is likely a compromised website. The module expects that another URL will be stored at the previously retrieved URL, which initially we found to be the following: hxxp://bbmsync2727[.]com/upd/secure_scan. executed, will begin the MSIL/Crimson lifecycle all over again by downloading a new controller/orchestrator. secApp initial downloader, however the initial beacon that is sent to the C&C was doupdat rather than updatc and was configured to connect to the same hardcoded C&C but to a different port. In addition to supporting the updatc command issued by the C&C, this module also supports the following commands: info, upsecs, and upmain. The info command supports the same functionality that the main RAT module supports while upsecs and upmain allows the controller to modify the path and application names for both the secApp and mainApp. Credential Stealer The pssApp is a password harvesting module that initially appears to support retrieving saved credentials from the Chrome, Firefox, and Opera browsers. Successfully harvested credentials are stored in a hardcoded location such as: %APPDATA%\Roaming\chrome\chrome_update . If no credentials are found, the credential log will simply contain “Not Found> > <” while an example of successfully stolen credentials are shown in Figure xx. In our very limited testing, this module was not able to retrieve passwords from Opera 35.0.2066.68 or Firefox 44.0.2 but was successful with Chrome 48.0.2564.116 m. Figure 28: Successfully harvested credentials by the pssApp module Windows Live, FileZilla, Vitalwerks’ Dynamic Update Client (DUC), and Paltalk. Keylogger The keylogger module is a basic keylogger that stores keylogs in a plain text file (Fig. 29) in a hardcoded location. The “nvidia” in the following location: %APPDATA%\NVIDIA\ . Figure 29: Data stored in “nvidia” keylog If either the updatu or usbwrm commands are issued, a USB drive module may be downloaded and set to execute on next startup. In the payload that we analyzed, the purpose only appears to search for potentially interesting files in removable storage and copy them to the local disk, likely so they may be exfiltrated at a later time. This payload may be configured with a set of file extensions (Fig 30) that are used to search for matching files on any USB drives. If any files are found, they are copied to a configured directory on the local disk while a running list of copied files are stored in a separate log so duplicate files are not copied. The anti-duplication method, however, only utilizes filenames so in the event that an already copied file is later modified, a newer copy will not be saved for exflitration. Despite one of the commands that may be used to download this payload may indicate this payload to contain “worm” functionality, that does not appear to be the case. remvUser During our research, we were not able to locate this module; so we are not sure what its functionality is. A best guess is that it could be a clean-up/implant removal utility. Python/Peppy Peppy is a Python-based RAT with the majority of its appearances having similarities or definite overlap with MSIL/ Crimson appearances. Peppy communicates to its C&C over HTTP and utilizes SQLite for much of its internal functionality and tracking of exfiltrated files. The primary purpose of Peppy may be the automated exfiltration of potentially interesting files and keylogs. Once Peppy successfully communicates to its C&C, the keylogging and exfiltration of files using configurable search parameters begins (Fig. 30). Files are exfiltrated using HTTP POST requests (Fig. 31). Figure 30: Peppy configurable search parameters Figure 31: Peppy exfiltrating files In addition to keylogging and the exfiltration of files, Peppy is also capable of accepting commands from its C&C to update itself, disable itself, exfiltrate a specific file, uninstall itself, execute a shell command, take screenshots, spawn a reverse shell, and download a remote file and execute it. was possibly written by the author(s) of Peppy based on code overlap between the downloader’s functionality and Peppy’s download_exec routine (Fig. 32, 33). Figure 32: Python downloader code Figure 33: Peppy download_exec routine and MyURLOpener class Conclusion As we described, there are clearly a number of common threads throughout these attacks. We have been able to connect campaigns, vectors, payloads, and, in some cases, infrastructure, but additional details continue to emerge. In the short term, this serves as an important reminder that wars are no longer waged solely on the ground or in the air. Rather, threat actors (whether from nation-states or private parties with interests in international conflicts) will use a variety of cyber tools to achieve their goals.
