Among other features, the malicious app can also capture the device screen and take pictures from the device’s camera, etc. Technical Analysis APK Metadata InformationApp Name: The China Freedom Trap Package Name: com.emc.pdf permissions are listed below.Description Allows the app to view information about network connections Allows access to phone state, including the current cellular network information, the phone number and the serial number of this phone, the status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any Phone Accounts registered on the device Access phone messages Allows the app to modify or delete SMS Access phone contactsnumberPermissions PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS Allows the app to process outgoing calls and modify the dialing WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE Allows the app to write or delete files to the external storage of ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION Allows the app to get the approximate location of the device network sources such as cell towers and Wi-Fi Allows the app to get the precise location of the device using ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION the Global Positioning System (GPS) GET_ACCOUNTS Allows the app to get the list of accounts used by the phone READ_HISTORY_BOOKMARKS Allows the app to read the Browser’s history and bookmarksthe device Access phone call logs Allows the app to record audio with the microphone, which can be misused by attackers2/10Source Code ReviewOur static analysis indicated that the malware steals information from the infected devices based on the commands received from the TA’s Command and Control (C&C) server.While launching the application for the first time, the malware checks the android device SDK version. If the version is below 29, the malware hides its icon from the device screen and runs silently in the background. The code snippet below is used to hide the app’s icon.Figure 2 – Code to Hide App IconIf the Android device version is more than 29, it opens the rd.pdf file present in the APK resources.Figure 3 – App Opens PDFThe file rd.pdf contains the cover page, the introduction of the book and the author, and a condolence letter, as shown in figures 4 and 5.3/10Figure 4 – rd.pdf File4/10Figure 5 – Condolence LetterAfter execution, the malware checks for internet connectivity in the device and fetches information, such as Wi-Fi, DHCP, etc.Figure 6 – Code to Get Internet Connectivity InfoThe image below contains the code through which the malware can get phone information such as network operator details and device location from GSM or CDMA connection. Most importantly, the malware has a code that can fetch the neighboring cell information, including Received Signal Strength and Cell ID location.Figure 7 – Code to Get Phone Info5/10The malware also reads the phone information including the SIM’s IMEI, serial number, sim operator information, etc., as shown in the figure below.Figure 8 – Code to get SIM InformationThe code snippet below depicts the malware’s ability to get the details of the running processes in the device.Figure 9 – Code to Get Information of Running ProcessesThe malware uses the code below to collect the victim’s SMS data. Attackers can use stolen SMS data to perform various malicious activities such as stealing contact details, bypassing two-factor authentication, etc.Figure 10 – Code to Collect SMSesThrough the code showcased below, the spyware collects the contact information saved on the victim’s device. After collecting the contact data, TAs can further extend their target or execute various malicious campaigns on those contacts.Figure 11 – Code to Collect Contacts DataThe code snippet below shows the malware’s capability to collect call logs from the victim’s device.6/10Figure 12 – Code to Collect Call LogsThe malicious app can also make outgoing calls from the victim device without the user’s knowledge, as shown in the figure below.Figure 13 – Code to Make CallThrough the spyware, TAs can send SMSes to other numbers with SMS content provided from the C&C server. TAs can use this feature to send spam messages or extend their campaign by sending malicious links.Figure 14 – Code to Send SMSThe code snippet shown below is used by the malware to delete SMSes and call logs from the victim device.Figure 15 – Code to Delete SMS and call logs7/10Furthermore, the malware captures the screen of the victim device and sends it to the TA’s C&C server.Figure 16 – Code to Capture Device ScreenThe code below is used by the malware to check if the camera is present in the device. In cases where the camera is available, this code enables the malware to take pictures and upload them to the TA’s C&C server.Figure 17 – Code to Capture Image Using CameraThe malware connects to the TA’s server to receive commands and send data from the victim’s device.Figure 18 – Command & Control URLConclusion8/10TAs are leveraging various methods, including regional and biogeographical conflicts, to fulfill their malicious intents. In this case, they are seen taking advantage of the Uyghur–Chinese conflict to target unsuspecting individuals.According to our research, this type of malware is only distributed via sources other than Google Play Store. As a result, practicing basic cyber hygiene across mobile devices and online banking applications is a good way to prevent such malware from compromising your devices. Our RecommendationsWe have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:How to prevent malware infection?Download and install software only from official app stores like Google Play Store or the iOS App Store. Use a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices, such as PCs, laptops, and mobile devices. Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible. Enable biometric security features such as fingerprint or facial recognition for unlocking the mobile device where possible. Be wary of opening any links received via SMS or emails delivered to your phone. Ensure that Google Play Protect is enabled on Android devices. Be careful while enabling any permissions. Keep your devices, operating systems, and applications updated.How to identify whether you are infected?Regularly check the Mobile/Wi-Fi data usage of applications installed on mobile devices. Keep an eye on the alerts provided by Anti-viruses and Android OS and take necessary actions accordingly.What to do when you are infected?Disable Wi-Fi/Mobile data and remove SIM cards – as in some cases, the malware can re-enable the Mobile Data. Perform a factory reset. Remove the application in case a factory reset is not possible. Take a backup of personal media Files (excluding mobile applications) and perform a device reset.What to do in case of any fraudulent transaction?In case of a fraudulent transaction, immediately report it to the concerned bank.What should banks do to protect their customers?Banks and other financial entities should educate customers on safeguarding themselves from malware attacks via telephone, SMS, or emails.MITRE ATT&CK® TechniquesTactic ExecutionTechnique ID Technique Name T1575Deliver Malicious App via Other Mean.
