This data is provided to help cyber security professionals and system administrators guard against the persistent malicious actions of cyber threat actors. This FLASH was coordinated with DHS/CISA. This FLASH has been released TLP:WHITEWE NEED YOUR HELP! If you identify any suspicious activity within your enterprise or have related information,please contact your local FBI Cyber Squad immediately with respect to the procedures outlined in theReporting Notice section of this message.*Note: By reporting any related information to FBI Cyber Squads, you are assisting in sharing information that allows the FBI to trackmalicious actors and coordinate with private industry and the United States Government to prevent future intrusions and attacks.Indicators of Compromise Associated with Diavol RansomwareSummary The FBI first learned of Diavol ransomware in October 2021. Diavol is associated with developers from the Trickbot Group, who are responsible for the Trickbot Banking Trojan. Diavol encrypts files solely using an RSA encryption key, and its code is capable of prioritizing file types to encrypt based on a pre-configured list of extensions defined by the attacker. While ransom demands have ranged from $10,000 to $500,000, Diavol actors have been willing to engage victims in ransom negotiations and accept lower payments. The FBI has not yet observed Diavol leak victim data, despite ransom notes including threats to leak stolen information.TLP:WHITETLP:WHITETechnical Details Diavol creates a unique identifier for victim computers via the generation of a System or Bot ID with the following format:[hostname]-[username]_W[windows_version].[32CharacterString] (example BOT ID follows:)EXAMPLEHOSTNAME-EXAMPLEUSERNAME_W617601.6A8DA4GEEV11E43V85556FE984GG94W1GThe Bot ID generated by Diavol is nearly identical to the format used by TrickBot and the Anchor DNS malware, also attributed to Trickbot. Once the Bot ID is generated, Diavol attempts to connect to a hardcoded command and control (C2) address. If the registration to the botnet is successful, the infected device connects to the C2 again to request updated configuration values. Diavol encrypts files and appends the “.lock64” file extension to the encrypted files. The file contents are encrypted using Microsoft CryptoAPI functions and then written to the new encrypted file. Diavol can also terminate processes and services.Indicators Once files are encrypted, the desktop background color is changed to black, and the following message is stored in a BMP file and displayed: “All your files were encrypted. For more information see README-FOR-DECRYPT.txt.” Files are encrypted with the “.lock64” extension and the ransom note is dropped into the folders. A readme file dropped on victims’ machines directs them to a TOR website to obtain a decryption key.After successful execution of the malware, Diavol can be found in the following directories:Diavol indicators as of 12/2021 DirectoriesWhitelisted File Extensions Whitelisted Files .restorereadme_for_decrypt.txt %WINDIR% locker.txt unlocker.txt%ProgramData% %UserProfile%Whitelisted Paths%PROGRAMFILES% %PROGRAMW6432% %TEMP%Diavol’s malicious executables further contained the following PDB path: D:\Development\Master\onion\locker.divided\LockMainDIB\Release\LockMainDIB.pdbTLP:WHITETLP:WHITEThe following is an example of a ransom note used by Diavol, as of December 2021:### W h a t h a p p e n e d? ###--------------Your computers and servers were L O C K E D----------------------------You need to buy decryption tool for restore the network.-----------Take into consideration that we have also downloaded data from your networkThat in case of not making payment will be published on our news website.----------------# How to get my f i l e s back? #----------------1.

The FBI does not encourage paying ransoms. Payment does not guarantee files will be recovered. It may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. However, the FBI understands that when victims are faced with an inability to function, all options are evaluated to protect shareholders, employees and customers. The FBI may be able to provide threat mitigation resources to those impacted by Diavol ransomware. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to promptly report ransomware incidents to your local field office. Doing so provides the FBI with critical information needed to prevent future attacks by identifying and tracking ransomware attackers and holding them accountable under US law.TLP:WHITETLP:WHITERecommended MitigationsImplement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud). Implement network segmentation and maintain offline backups of data to ensure limited interruption to the organization. Regularly back up data, password protect backup copies offline. Ensure copies of criticaldata are not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the data resides. Install and regularly update antivirus software on all hosts, and enable real time detection. Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as updates/patches are released. Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new orunrecognized user accounts. Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls withleast privilege in mind. Do not give all users administrative privileges. Disable unused ports.  Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.  Disable hyperlinks in received emails.  Use multifactor authentication where possible.  Use strong passwords and regularly change passwords to network systems andaccounts, implementing the shortest acceptable timeframe for password changes. Avoid reusing passwords for multiple accounts. Require administrator credentials to install software.  Only use secure networks and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks. Consider installing andusing a VPN. Focus on cyber security awareness and training. Regularly provide users with training on information security principles and techniques as well as overall emerging cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities (i.e., ransomware and phishing scams).Additional Resources For additional resources related to the prevention and mitigation of ransomware, go to url as well as the CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.
