It is in use by the Molerats (aka Gaza cybergang), a politically motivated group whose main objective, we believe, is intelligence gathering. Operating since 2012, the group's activity has been reported by Norman 1, Kaspersky2,3, FireEye4, and PwC5.This report revolves around a campaign that includes a new malware developed by a member of the group or on behalf of the group. Based on dozens of known attacks and the vast infrastructure in use - we estimate that a wave of targeted malicious email messages has been sent on a weekly basis.These attacks are targeted, but not spear-phished. I.e., malicious email messages are sent to selected targets rather than random mass distribution, but are not tailored specifically to each and every target. Dozens of targets may receive the exact same message. The email message and the lure document are written in Hebrew, Arabic or English - depending on the target audience.Targeted sectors include governmental and diplomatic institutions, including embassies; companies from the aerospace and defence Industries; financial institutions; journalists; software developers.The attackers have been targeting software developers in general, using a fake website pretending to be a legitimate iOS management software, and linking to it in an online freelancing marketplace.Most targets are from the Middle East: Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Iraq. The United States and countries in Europe are targeted as well.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank our colleagues for their ongoing information sharing and feedback, which have been crucial for this research: security researcher Infra; PassiveTotal analyst team; Tom Lancaster of PwC; Team Cymru; Security researcher Sebastián García; Menachem Perlman of LightCyber; Other security researchers who wish to remain anonymous.1 url 2 url 3 url 4 url ivy.html 5 url© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.comPage 3 of 42Tactics, Techniques and ProceduresDeliveryThe attackers would usually send a malicious email message that either links to an archive file (RAR or ZIP compressed) or has one attached to it. Below are malicious email messages that have been sent to multiple targets on September and December 2015.______________________________________________________________________________© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.comPage 4 of 42The link may include these parameters:Id - the ID of the current wave of malicious email messages, composed of a plaintext word, a plus sign, and a number. For example: Rand+281 token1 - same as id, but Base64 encoded token2 - Base64 encoded email address of the target to which the malicious message was sent.  C - the word Click or openexeThe following regular expression matches the structure of malicious links:\/[A-Za-z]+\.php\?((?:id|token1|token2|C)=[A-Za-z0-9\/=+%]*={0,2}&?){4}For example: spynews.otzo[.]com/20151104/Update.php?id=>redacted>&token1=>redacted>&token2=>redacted>&C=Cli ckThe archive contains an .exe file, sometimes disguised as a Microsoft Word file, a video, or another file format, using the corresponding icon. For example:Lure content and sender identityIf the victim extracts the archive and clicks the .exe file, the lure document or video are presented while the computer is being infected with DustySky.In recent samples the group used Microsoft Word files embed with a malicious macro, which would infect the victim if enabled. Note, that these infection methods rely on social engineering - convincing the victim to open the file (and enabling content if it is disabled) - and not on software vulnerabilities.The subject line of the malicious email message, as well as the name and content of the lure document, are usually related to recent events in diplomacy, defense, and politics. Sometimes lure topics are gossip or sex related and might even include a pornographic video. In recent samples, fake invoices and a copy of the public Google privacy policy were used.The content of the lure document is always copied from a public news item or other web content, and is never an original composition of the attackers.The “from” field in malicious messages is usually set to be related to the lure document, such as “Latest Israel news”, “Israeli Hot Stories”, “Israel Defense Forces“, تاسايسلل تاراملإا زكرم Policy Center organization6).” (impersonates the Emirates"6 “The center undertakes the task of foreseeing the future of region, regional and international policy trends and the impact of different geopolitical projects on the region. It aims at providing strategic analysis, policy papers, studies, and research to serve the decision makers at any institution or country in the region with a priority given to UAE.”______________________________________________________________________________© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.comPage 5 of 42When linked from the malicious message, the malware would be hosted either on a cloud service (many times in copy.com, a legitimate file hosting service), or on a server controlled by the attackers.PhishingWhen the malware is hosted on a server controlled by the attackers, the User-Agent string of the target’s browser is checked when they click the malicious link. If the target is using Windows, DuskySky is served. If the operating system is different than Windows, the target is served a Google, Microsoft, or Yahoo phishing page:______________________________________________________________________________© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.comPage 6 of 42The source code of the phishing page is made up of a single JavaScript block, which at runtime decodes a single variable into HTML:After the victim fills in and sends the fake login form, they are redirected to a legitimate website. For example, in one case the victim was redirected to a news item7 in the Israeli news website NRG. Only the news item was old (from one year prior to the attack) and unrelated to the original subject of the malicious email message. It was probably used in previous attacks, and the attackers did not care enough or forgot to 2015:The fake website, similarly to the legitimate one, offers visitors to download the iMazing software. However, the version on the fake website is bundled with DustySky malware. Upon execution of the malicious version marketplace website freelancer.com. In the posting, the attackers claim they are looking for someone to9 url© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.comPage 8 of 42build “an application like that this website [sic]” and entice the viewer to “download application and take an overlook [sic]” from imazing[.]ga and “Let me know if any idea is missing or…”.This behavior deviates from the attackers’ usual pattern of sending malicious email to selected (albeit many) individuals. It is unclear to us why they would go after random infections, but we can imagine various reasons, such as access to computers which would be used as proxies for attacks, or access to licenses for software owned by the victims.Post infectionThis section describes the actions performed by the attackers on infected computers we have investigated.After infecting the computer, the attackers used both the capabilities of DustySky, and those of public hacking tools they had subsequently downloaded to the computer.______________________________________________________________________________© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.comPage 9 of 42They took screenshots and a list of active processes in the computer, and sent them to their command and control severs. They used BrowserPasswordDump10, a public and free-to-use tool that recovers passwords saved in browsers. Below is the log file (empty in this case) that we recovered after the attackers had deleted it:The malware would also scan the computer for files that contain certain keywords. The list of keywords, in base64 format, is retrieved from the command and control as a text file. For example:Below are the encoded strings from the above image, decoded and translated:Base64 string .pfx10 url© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.comPage 10 of 42These words teach us what the attackers are after: personal documents; credentials, certificates service called privatetunnel.com (in previous incidents, emails were sent from a nearby address - August 2015. It is composed of a DustySky dropper, DustySky core, and the DustySky keylogging component.DustySky dropperThe DustySky dropper tries to evade running in a virtual machine. Once sure the computer is not a VM, it extracts, runs and adds persistency to DustySky Core. It extracts basic information about the operating system and checks for the existence of an Antivirus. It also extracts and opens the lure document.The dropper's resources are two components that are dropped at run time. One is the lure document (internally called “news”), which is presented to the victim once the dropper is executed. The other is DustySky Core, a Trojan backdoor, (internally called “log”).The dropper uses the following function to obfuscate the name of functions and other parts of the malware virtual machine (vboxmrxnp.dll and vmbusres.dll which indicate vitualbox and vmGuestlib.dll which indicates vmware).______________________________________________________________________________© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.comPage 12 of 42If the dropper is indeed running in a virtual machine, it will open the lure document and stop its activity:The dropper uses Windows Management Instrumentation11 to extract information about the operating system and whether an antivirus is active.DustySky Core is dropped to %TEMP% and runs using either cmd or the .NET interface.11 url© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.comPage 13 of 42A registry entry is created for persistency after computer restart:DustySky coreDustySky Core is a Trojan backdoor and the main component of the malware. It communicates with the command and control server, exfiltrates collected data, information and files, and receives and executes commands. It has the following capabilities: Collecting information about the OS version, running processes and installed software.  Searching for removable media and network drives, and duplicating itself into them.  Extracting other components (such as the keylogging component) or receiving them from thecommand and control server, and running or removing them. Evading virtual machines.  Turning the computer off or restarting it.  Making sure only a single instance of the malware is running.The keylogging log file is uploaded to the server every 50 seconds. The files are uploaded via a POST request to a URL that ends with key.php.______________________________________________________________________________© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.comPage 14 of 42DustySky keylogging componentOne of the components contained in DustySky core is a keylogger (for example Worm\obj\x86\Release\MusicLogs.pdbpdb strings from 23 samples are presented in “Appendix B - Indicators”. In the table below we present a breakdown of folders and file names comprising the pdb strings, to reflect the ongoing development cycle of altered).DustySky has two hardcoded domains of command and control servers. It starts by checking if the first one is alive by sending a GET request to TEST.php or index.php, expecting “OK” as response.

It's worth noting that all IP addresses have been active in the past several weeks with many of the domains resolving to them being a combination (green squares) of dynamic DNS providers (blue squares) and registered domains (brown squares). These heatmaps allow us to identify December 23rd. On that day, the actors seem to remove the registered domain and strictly use dynamic DNS. It's unclear why this would occur, but it's possible that the server changed functions in the attack or when both dynamic DNS and registered domains are in use. This occurs from September 23rd to December 17th and has a number of days where new domains are associated to the IP address. While not entirely known, this period could reflect the actors going live in their operation. Based on emails sent and compilation dates, there were plenty of phishing campaigns going on during this period of time. It's also Graph One, we can see an increase in domains around the November timeframe with a drop-off in December. Again, not entirely clear, but November may have been a point where the attackers felt the need November 9th, the actors introduced four unique, registered domains before then adding dynamic DNS providers. What's most interesting about this IP address is that the content for both dynamic DNS urls and registered domains lead to the same download page that hosts a Windows executable. It's unclear why the attackers continue to use both, but the move from registered domains to also using dynamic DNS domains could suggest the actors are beginning to wise up. The use of dynamic DNS infrastructure makes attribution registered domains. Given the recent activity and a large amount of domains being pointed at this IP address, it's plausible that this server may be the most current of the actors. In fact, it could be involved in on-going operations that we have seen into this year.______________________________________________________________________________© Clearsky - Cyber security. clearskysec.comPage 22 of 42Threat actor and AttributionWe attribute the DustySky attacks, with medium-high certainty, to the same group that FireEye12 called Molerats and Kaspersky13 called Gaza cybergang.
