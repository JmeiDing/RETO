NANHAISHURATing the South China SeaTLP: WhiteSUMMARY This whitepaper details a malicious program we identify as NanHaiShu. Based on our analysis, the threat actor behind this malware targets government and private-sector organizations. Notable targets of the malware include the Department of Justice of the Philippines, the organizers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit and a major international law firm.We believe these entities were targeted for their involvement in a dispute centering on the South China Sea. The conflicting territorial claims at the heart of the issue were addressed by an international tribunal on 12th July 2016[1]. Based on the specific selection of organizations targeted for attack by this malware, as well as indications revealed in our technical analysis of the malware itself, we believe the threat actor to be of Chinese origin.We saw the first sample of NanHaiShu in the wild for the last couple years, and as of March 2016, it is still being actively distributed. Technically speaking, the malware is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that is spread in spearphishing email messages which contain the malware as a malicious file attachment. The contents of the email message include, among other things, industry-specific terms that indicate they were deliberately designed with the specific targets in mind.The attached file contains a VBA macro that executes an embedded JScript file. It is likely that the threat actor knew the targets use VBA macros in their business environment, since the attack only works if the default security setting in Microsoft Office is modified to allow macro execution.Once installed on a machine in the target network, NanHaiShu sends information from the infected machine to a remote command and control (C&C) server.CONTENTS Attack overview 3 Infection vector 3 Target details 3 Timeline 4 Attribution & links 5 Consequences 5 Technical analysis 6 Infection sequence 6 Obfuscation 9 Network traffic 9 Other notes 10 Sources 12 Appendix A | Samples 13 Appendix B | IOCS 14F-SECURE LABS WhitepaperPublished: July 20162INTELLIGENCEATTACK OVERVIEWInfection vector The threat actor uses spearphishing email messages to deliver the malware to their targets, with the text contents of the emails carefully crafted (or ‘socially engineered’) to the recipients. For example, the content of the email messages used to target the law firm included text related to salary or financial matters (Image 1).The care displayed in crafting the contents of the spearphishing emails indicates the level of effort made by the threat actor to convince recipients that the emails were legitimate.Target details The common denominator among the targets selected is that they have some relation to the territorial dispute revolving around the South China Sea.Targets included the Department of Justice of the Philippines, the organizers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit and an international law firm representing one of the involved parties.Philippines Department of Justice The Department of Justice of the Philippines has been involved in the arbitration case filed by that country against China[2].APEC organizers A sample we recently encountered used a theme related to the Economic Leader’s Meeting (AELM), an event tied to the APEC Summit that was held in the Philippines in November 2015[3]. In the leadup to the event,news reports had indicated that the South China Sea dispute was expected to be tabled and addressed by the ministers[4,5].Major international law firm This major international law firm represents nation states in arbitration cases involving the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Since 2013, this firm has been representing one of the parties in its dispute[6].Prior to publication, we made an attempt to reach out to the organizations that we identified as targets and notified them of this threat. Per request, some details have been withheld from inclusion in this public report.IMAGE 1: SPEAR FISHING EMAIL TARGETING LAW FIRM EMPLOYEES3TIMELINEMultiple NanHaiShu samples were discovered over the course of the investigation. Of the samples collected, a particular subset was tasked with gathering intelligence related to the South China Sea arbitration case.Distribution of this subset of samples started from January 13th 2015. The file “DOJ Staff bonus January 13, 2015. xls” was seen just a month after the Permanent Court of Arbitration posted a third press release about the arbitration case between the two countries[7].The press release announced that the Philippines (represented by the law firm) had until March 15th 2015 to submit supplemental arguments on their case, while China had until June 16th 2015 to provide a response to the submission.Two attacks happened between the two aforementioned deadlines:y After the Philippines’ deadline, a document filewith a filename that referenced the company name was sent to the law firm.y Another file that also targeted the lawyers usedthe name “Salary and Bonus Data.xls” and was released on May 22th 2015, or barely a month before China’s deadline.We saw another sample of this threat also being distributed using a file named “AELM Entertainment budget and Attendance allowance.xls”.This file was seen in the wild on October 2nd 2015, more than a month prior to the actual event in the Philippines. The event was attended by, among others, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama; one of the main topics that was expected to be tabled during the event was the South China Sea dispute[4,5].On October 26th 2015, there were multiple news reports about the movement of US military ships in the South China Sea[8,9]. In the exact same time frame, there was a notable change in the C&C servers contacted by the malware (see Attribution & Links section).4TIMELINE OF NANHAISHUMALWARE DISCOVERYNovember 2015APEC Summit takes place in the PhilippinesOctober 2015Samples seen in the wildC&C servers switch IP addressAELM allowance.xlsOctober 2015 News on US shipmovementsJune 16 2015Deadline for China to submit responseMay 2015Samples seen in the wildSalary and Bonus Data.xlsMarch 2015Samples seen in the wildThe draft Foley Hoag reform of the distribution of shares and remuneration system.xlsMarch 15 2015Deadline for Philippines tosubmit supplemental argumentsJanuary 2015Sample seen in the wildDOJ Staff bonus January 13, 2015.xlsDecember 2014Permanent Court of Arbitration announcement on Philippines-China arbitration caseIMAGE 2: VARIABLE NAMES ATTRIBUTIONSearch results for the variable names in NanHaiShu’s base64 decoder functionIMAGE 3: CODE COMPARISONNanHaiShu’s VBA base64 decoder (top) vs.publicly available JavaScript base64 decoder (bottom)ATTRIBUTION & LINKSThe malware’s VBA base64 decoder function seems to be popular among Chinese programmers - searching for the variable names on the Internet leads to a handful of Chinese websites (Image 2).The variables initialization used by the VBA malware script appears to be a forked version of the Javascript base64 decoder. This latter code was publicly available in a blog post from the Chinese Software Developer Network (CSDN) website (Image 3), as early as 2005.NanHaiShu samples initially had most of their C&C servers resolve to IP addresses hosted in the United States (specifically, to cloud computing service providers). On October 26th 2015 however, all of the malware’s C&C 4), an IP hosted from a Chinese AS, coinciding with news reports of US ship movements in the South China Sea [8,9].Our technical analysis indicates a notable orientation towards code and infrastructure associated with developers in mainland China. In addition, we also consider it significant that the selection of organizations targeted for infiltration are directly relevant to topics that are considered to be of strategic national interest to the Chinese government. Based on these points, we believe that the threat actor is of Chinese origin.CONSEQUENCESNanHaiShu is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and thus is able to send system information from an infected machine to a remote C&C server. It is capable of receiving and executing additional JScript and VBScript code. The RAT can also download any file the attacker pleases. The downloaded files or scripts may then be used for exfiltration of data that is likely to be highly sensitive, service providers and as with most such messages, use socially engineered text content to entice the user into opening the attachment. The file is usually an XLS, but may also be a DOC file. Regardless of format, the attached document contains a malicious macro.In most major business environments today, the ability to run macros is disabled by default in the security settings for Microsoft Office programs. If this setting has been modified however, or if the individual user is permitted to enable macros, it is still possible for macro code to be launched.Office will display a notification message before the macro code can be executed:IMAGE 5: MACRO SECURITY WARNINGThe user must actively enable the macros in the document for the attack to continue. If the user unwittingly does so, the VBA macro decodes and runs.IMAGE 6: VBA MACRO DECODES AND EXECUTES THE JSCRIPT6In most of the samples, two sets of Base64 encoded files are embedded in the VBA macro. For the recent sample, the VBA macro will decode and first write JScript data to “%appdata%\Microsoft\Network\network.js”, then execute it.IMAGE 7: VBA MACRO DECODES & OPENS DECOY XLS FILEThe macro then decodes a decoy XLS file, which it saves to the current directory using the same filename as the malicious XLS. The decoy is then loaded. Finally, the macro creates a VBScript file that will delete the original file.Meanwhile, the network.js modifies the %regrun% registry to point to itself as its autostart mechanism.The code will proceed to retrieve the following system information (Image 8, next page) and upload it to the C&C server:1. Volume Serial Number 2. IP Address 3. Computer Name 4. User Name 5. Operating System 6. Proxy ServerAfterwards, it waits for instructions from the server for a maximum interval of 10.584 seconds (or 6 * 0x6e4 ms).7IMAGE 8: INFORMATION GATHERING ROUTINE8OBFUSCATIONThe VBA macro uses base64 encoding to embed the decoy XLS and JScript file. For the recent sample, the URL string used inside the JScript code was obfuscated in two layers; it had to be decoded using base64, then decrypted using a routine that extracts and converts a Unicode number to a character.IMAGE 9: ADDITIONAL OBFUSCATION ON TOP OF BASE64 ENCODINGNETWORK TRAFFICThe attackers utilize dynamic DNS providers for their C&C server; the server that the malware contacts is already included the malicious JScript code. For the most recent sample, the communication between the malware and C&C server uses this data structure before encoding:md5(Volume Serial Number) | IP Address | Computer Name | User Name | Operating System | Proxy Server | Malware Version |Below is the POST data example from an infected VM image:action=aaa&data=N2RkZjMyZTE3YTZhYzVjZTA0YThlY2JmNzgyY2E1MDl8MTkyLjE2OC4xLjF8Sm9obkRvZS1QQ3xKb2huRG 9lLVBDXEpvaG5Eb2UoYWRtaW5pc3RyYXRvcil8TWljcm9zb2Z0IFdpbmRvd3MgWFAgUHJvZmVzc2lvbmFsfHxqc25lWzEuNF 0saW1wdCxwcnw=The malware uses HTTP POST to upload the encoded system information and uses HTTP GET to download and execute JScript and VBScript code.IMAGE 10: THE FUNCTION THAT UPLOAD DATA, DOWNLOAD FILES AND EXECUTE SCRIPTS9OTHER NOTESThe JScript contains a constant variable named “gVersion”. The variable seems to be the malware name/version used by the threat actor to identify the source of data.The variable “gVersion” contained variations of the following strings:1. hta[1.1]doj.m 2. jsne[1.3.3]PP 3. jsne[1.4],impt,prIMAGE 11: GVERSION VARIABLEThe gVersion of the recent JScript is “jsne[1.4],impt,pr”.The HTA file dropped by the “DOJ Staff bonus January 13, 2015.xls” sample has the same JScript routines that exists in later samples, but they are encapsulated inside an HTML format. The file is loaded using the MSHTA.EXE program, which opens up the Internet Explorer. Compared with HTML, the HTA has more privileges that can create, edit and remove files and registry entries[10].IMAGE 12: HTML TAGS ENCAPSULATING THE MALWARE CODE10The first SCRIPT tag moves the IE window outside the viewable area and hides it using the resizeTo command. The second SCRIPT tag contains the JScript routine that are common among NanHaiShu samples.The only difference between the HTA and the JScript files is that the C&C is not encrypted and it contains the SafeIE function, which modifies the “Internet Settings” and “Internet Explorer” registries to avoid any prompt related to running unsafe ActiveX.IMAGE 13: SAFEIE FUNCTION USED TO PREVENT ANY ACTIVEX PROMPT11SOURCES[1] Washington Post; Beijing’s claims to South China Sea rejected by international tribunal?; published 12 July 2016;url sea-tribunal-ruling-looms/2016/07/12/11100f48-4771-11e6-8dac-0c6e4accc5b1_story.html[2] CNN Philippines; De Lima on The Hague hearings: The world is watching; published July 15 2015;url APEC2015; Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit 2015 Economic Leader’s Meeting (AELM);url Reuters; Obama puts South China Sea dispute on agenda as summitry begins; published 17 Nov 2015;url Wall Street Journal; Obama Sets Tone for APEC Forum With Focus on South China Sea; published 17 Nov 2015;url GMA News Online; PROFILES: Can these foreign lawyers help PHL win its arbitration case vs. China?; published July 17 2015; url phl-win-its-arbitration-case-vs-china[7] Permanent Court of Arbitration; Press Release: Arbitration between the Republic of the Philippines and the People’sRepublic of China; published 17 December 2014; url No_3%20%28ENG%29dac6.pdf?fil_id=2846[8] Reuters; U.S. Navy destroyer nears islands built by China in South China Sea; published 26 Oct 2015;url The Guardian; US navy to send destroyer in serious challenge to China territorial claims; published 26 Oct 2015; url Wikipedia; HTML Application; url A | SAMPLESTable 1.
