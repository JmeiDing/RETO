To date, more than 1330 messages have been sent to the e-mail addresses of public institutions.Owners of .md domains are informed by e-mail about the expiration of the domain name's validity period and are asked to initiate the procedure for extending it, requesting access to a link to make the payment.STISC recommends avoiding accessing such links, as well as blocking, reporting the sender.1/2At the same time, in the context of the continuation of the wave of scam and phishing cyber attacks during the holidays, we urge you to always check the real source of the message and respect the rules of cyber hygiene.We inform you that phishing is one of the most common cyber attacks, through which criminals on the Internet try to steal money, personal information, banking information, card or account numbers, PIN codes, etc. Cybercriminals usually pretend to be reputable companies, friends, or acquaintances and send emails or SMSs that draw attention to technical malfunctions or errors and request re-introduction of personal data or even payment.Scam attacks are an example of payment fraud. Email messages sent by criminals contain true information about the institution and request payments by not following the usual/legal payment authorization procedure, but by accessing a link.We note that cyber attacks can have dire consequences and we urge you to follow the minimum cyber security rules.Photo:2/2
