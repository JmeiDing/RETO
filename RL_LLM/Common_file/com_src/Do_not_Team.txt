11/30/2019Positive Technologies - learn and secure : Studying Donot TeamStudying Donot Teamblog.ptsecurity.com/2019/11/studying-donot-team.htmlAPT group called Donot Team (aka APT-C-35, SectorE02) has been active since at least 2012. The attackers hunt for conﬁdential information and intellectual property. The hackers' targets include countries in South Asia, in particular, state sector of Pakistan. In 2019, we noticed their activity in Bangladesh, Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and outside of Asia, in places like Argentina, the United Arab Emirates, and Great Britain.For several months, we have been monitoring changes in the code of this group's malicious loaders. In this article, we will review one of the attack vectors, will talk about the loaders in more detail, and will touch upon the peculiarity of the network infrastructure.Attack chain At the early stage of infection, the victim receives an MS Word document in Ofﬁce Open XML format. Even though we do not have clear evidence, we are sure that the initial penetration vector is a targeted phishing message with MS Ofﬁce attachment. The document itself is not malicious, but it abuses the external elements autoloading capability to launch the next stage document.Communicating with a linked external objectThe loaded ﬁne is an RTF document exploiting vulnerability CVE-2018-0802 in Microsoft Equation. The main shellcode is preceded by a chain of intermediate ones, each decrypting the subsequent slice with a single-byte XOR with keys 0x90 and 0xCE.blog.ptsecurity.com/2019/11/studying-donot-team.html1/811/30/2019Positive Technologies - learn and secure : Studying Donot TeamFirst shellcode decrypting the second oneSecond shellcode decrypting the third oneThird shellcode decrypting the main oneThe main shellcode performed the following actions:Uses a single-byte XOR with key 0x79 to decrypt binary data from ﬁle %TEMP%\one. Creates executable ﬁles C:\Windows\Tasks\Serviceﬂow.exe and C:\Windows\Tasks\sinter.exe. These are the group's malicious loaders. We will talk more about them later. Creates ﬁle C:\Windows\Tasks\S_An.dll, containing two bytes 0x90. Creates ﬁle C:\Windows\Tasks\A64.dll. Depending on the system bit capacity, this is a modiﬁed x64-bit or x86-bit version of UACMe utility escalating privileges in the system. In addition to bypassing UAC control, the library creates and launches BAT script %TEMP%\v.bat. The script will use the following commands to register one of the loaders created earlier as a service:sc create ServiceTool displayname= "ServiceFill" binpath= "C:\Windows\Tasks\Serviceﬂow.exe" start= "auto" sc start ServiceToolblog.ptsecurity.com/2019/11/studying-donot-team.html2/811/30/2019Positive Technologies - learn and secure : Studying Donot TeamDecrypting BAT scripts in modiﬁed UACMe librariesCreates and launches JScript script C:\Windows\Tasks\bin.js. Its task is to launch library A64.dll via RnMod export using rundll32. Creates shortcut WORDICON.lnk in the startup folder. Its task is to launch loader sinter.exe after system restart. Creates shortcut Support.lnk in the startup folder. Its task is to launch bin.js JScript script after system reboot.blog.ptsecurity.com/2019/11/studying-donot-team.html3/811/30/2019Positive Technologies - learn and secure : Studying Donot TeamDecompiled code of the main shellcodeSo, at that stage there are two loaders with a ﬁrm foothold in the System. We will discuss their operation later on. Lo2 loaders Despite their classiﬁcation, the trojans have different objectives. For instance, ﬁle Serviceﬂow.exe acts as a watchdog. It collects the following information about the system:Username Computer name Contents of \Program Files\ and \Program Files (x86)\ OS version Data about the processorThe watchdog records the results in ﬁle log.txt. It also checks Windows\Tasks\ for ﬁles A64.dll and sinter.exe. If necessary, it downloads the ﬁles from control server skillsnew[.]top and launches them on behalf of the current user. The corresponding token is extracted from process winlogon.exe. Trojan sinter.exe lets the attackers know about the infection by sending a request to hxxps://mystrylust.pw/conﬁrm.php, and sends the collected information about the system to skillsnew[.]top. Then, if the attackers are still interested in the victim's computer, the trojan obtains contents of customer.txt ﬁle at hxxp://docs.google.com/uc? id=1wUaESzjGT2fSuP_hOJMpqidyzqwu15sz&export=download. The ﬁle contains the name for control server car[.]drivethrough.top, with which the trojan communicates further. Downloaded ﬁles are placed in folder \AppData\Roaming\InStore\, and launched with task scheduler.blog.ptsecurity.com/2019/11/studying-donot-team.html4/811/30/2019Positive Technologies - learn and secure : Studying Donot TeamDecrypted strings of command fragments and task templateAs a result of malicious loaders' activity, components of framework yty are inserted into the system, allowing the attackers to get more details about their victim, including ﬁles with a certain extension, intercepted input strings, list of processes, and screenshots. We will not discuss plugins in this article. When we studied other similar samples, we found some paths and project names left in the debugging information including the following:D:\Soft\DevelopedCode_Last\BitDefenderTest\m0\New_Single_File\Lo2\SingleV2\Release\BinWork.pdb D:\Soft\DevelopedCode_Last\BitDefenderTest\m0\New_Single_File\Lo2\SingleV2_Task_Layout_NewICON\Release\BinWork.pdb D:\Soft\DevelopedCode_Last\BitDefenderTest\m0\New_Single_File\Lo2\SingleV2_Task_Layout_NewICON_N_Lnk\Release\BinWork.pdb D:\Soft\DevelopedCode_Last\BitDefenderTest\m0\New_Single_File\Lo2\SingleV3\Release\WorkFile.pdb D:\Soft\DevelopedCode_Last\BitDefenderTest\m0\Off\Off_New_Api\Release\C++\ConnectLink.pdb D:\Soft\DevelopedCode_Last\BitDefenderTest\m0\Off\Off_New_Api\Release\C++\TerBin.pdb D:\Soft\DevelopedCode_Last\BitDefenderTest\m0\yty 2.0 - With AES Chunks LOC FOR XP Just Bit- Change_Name\Release\TaskTool.pdb D:\Soft\DevelopedCode_Last\BitDefenderTest\yty 2.0 - With AES Chunks OFFS Just Bit\Release\C++\MsBuild.pdb D:\Soft\DevelopedCode_Last\yty 2.0\Release\C++\Setup.pdbIn addition to substring yty 2.0 connecting the trojans with the framework, we also noticed substring Lo2, which may be an abbreviation from Loader 2.In loaders versions before mid-2018, all used strings were stored in the ﬁle in cleartext. In subsequent builds, the attackers started encrypting the strings. In different versions, the following changes were made to the algorithm:Since May 2018: reverse the string and encode with Base64 Since April 2019: perform the previous actions twice.blog.ptsecurity.com/2019/11/studying-donot-team.html5/811/30/2019Positive Technologies - learn and secure : Studying Donot TeamSince January 2019: encrypt the string with AES in CBC mode and encode with Base64. Sample of Python code for decryption:import base64 from Cryptodome.Cipher import AESaeskey = (0x23, 0xd4, 0x67, 0xad, 0x96, 0xc3, 0xd1, 0xa5, 0x23, 0x76, 0xae, 0x4e, 0xdd, 0xca, 0x13, 0x55)def aes_decrypt(data, aeskey): iv = bytes(list(range(0, 16))) key = bytes(aeskey) aes = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv) return aes.decrypt(data).decode().strip('\x00')def base64_aes_decrypt(data, aeskey): data = base64.b64decode(data) data = aes_decrypt(data, aeskey) return dataSince June 2019: perform symbol-by-symbol circular subtraction with the set array of bytes, encode with UTF-8, and encode with Base64. Sample of Python code for decryption:subgamma = (0x2d, 0x55, 0xf, 0x59, 0xf, 0xb, 0x60, 0x33, 0x29, 0x4e, 0x19, 0x3e, 0x57, 0x4d, 0x56, 0xf)def sub_decrypt(data, subgamma): o = '' length = len(data) subgamma_length = len(subgamma) for i in range(length): o += chr((0x100 + ord(data[i]) - subgamma[i%subgamma_length]) & 0xff) return odef base64_utf8_sub_decrypt(data, subgamma): data = base64.b64decode(data) data = data.decode('utf-8') data = sub_decrypt(data, subgamma) return dataSince October 2019: perform symbol-by-symbol circular modiﬁed XOR with the set array of bytes, and encode with Base64 twice. The peculiarity of XOR algorithm is that if the string symbol value matches the value of the symbol in the set array of bytes, XOR is not required. Sample of Python code for decryption:xorgamma = (0x56, 0x2d, 0x61, 0x21, 0x16)def modxor_decrypt(data, xorgamma): o = '' length = len(data) xorgamma_length = len(xorgamma) for i in range(length): c = data[i] if c != xorgamma[i%xorgamma_length]: c = data[i] ^ xorgamma[i%xorgamma_length] o += chr(c) return odef base64_modxor_decrypt(data, xorgamma): data = base64.b64decode(data) data = modxor_decrypt(data, xorgamma) return datablog.ptsecurity.com/2019/11/studying-donot-team.html6/811/30/2019Positive Technologies - learn and secure : Studying Donot TeamWhen we were writing the decryption script, we found that some strings couldn’t be decrypted. But then we found that these lines can still be decrypted with one of the decryption methods mentioned earlier. After we veriﬁed that each sample uses only one decryption method, we concluded that the attackers had simply forgotten to delete unused strings or replace them with those correctly encrypted for the next version of the malware.Strings in one of the loader samples were encrypted with various methods, but only one is used in the executable ﬁle.Such mistakes are always advantageous for the researchers. For instance, the strings left by the attackers often contained the attackers' control servers which we did not know about before. Network Infrastructure peculiarities To complete the picture, we want to point out some typical features which can help you make a connection between the group's attacks in the future.Most of the control servers are rented from DigitalOcean, LLC (ASN 14061), and are located in Amsterdam. The attackers do not use the same servers for different DNS names. They prefer reserving a new allocated host for each new domain name. In most cases, domain owners' registration information is hidden with privacy services. The attackers can use the following services: WhoisGuard, Inc.; Whois Privacy Protection Service, Inc.; Domains By Proxy, LLC; and Whois Privacy Protection Foundation. In some cases the data is accessible, and we can see the common approach to ﬁlling the ﬁelds.blog.ptsecurity.com/2019/11/studying-donot-team.html7/811/30/2019Positive Technologies - learn and secure : Studying Donot TeamWHOIS information about domain burningforests[.]comWHOIS information about domain cloud-storage-service[.]comMost commonly, the attackers use .top, .pw, .space, .live, and .icu TLD.Conclusion Donot Team is known to use their own tools at every stage of the attack. On the one hand, the group uses various techniques to make code analysis more difﬁcult, but on the other hand, it does not attempt to hide or disguise their actions in the system. Multipleattacks on the same targets can be indicative of particular interest in the chosen range of victims. This can also mean that the used tactics and techniques are not very efﬁcient.Author: Alexey Vishnyakov, Positive Technologies IOCs hxxp://plug.msplugin.icu/MicrosoftSecurityScan/DOCSDOC skillsnew[.]top hxxps://mystrylust.pw/conﬁrm.php hxxp://docs.google.com/uc?id=1wUaESzjGT2fSuP_hOJMpqidyzqwu15sz&export=download car[.]drivethrough.top burningforests[.]com cloud-storage-service[.]comblog.ptsecurity.com/2019/11/studying-donot-team.html8/8
