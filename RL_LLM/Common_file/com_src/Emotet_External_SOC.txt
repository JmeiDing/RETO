While the infection schema looks alike from years; the way the group tries to infect victims improves from day to day. Today I’d like to share a quick analysis resulted by a very interesting email which claimed to deliver a SOC “weekly report” on the victim email. First of all the attacker knew the target organization was protected by a SOC (Security Operation Center) so she sent a well crafted email claiming to deliver a Microsoft document wrapping out the weekly SOC report as a normal activity in order to induce the victim to open-it.SOC report 10 12 2019.doc ( ﬁle sent on Oct 11, 2019, 11:06:09 PM from grecia@ambientehomedecor.com . I believe that ambientehomedecor.com is not a malicious domain but mostly a new compromised one. Word document Dropper (Emotet) First stage of Emotet campaign targeting organization with Security Op‐ eration Centers 6144:tkPNPASKUzSRnLx3Q4td9pB8LGme764XNNHBly:tkPNPAfU‐ GRt3b3B8LGL6CNJFollowing the original eMail headers from grecia@ambientehomedecor.com to victim’s email box it is possible to ﬁgure-out the attacker used a SMPT client who left trace about the original related to a very nice town in northern France: Thury-Harcourt, France.url Emotet gang targeting companies with external SOC? – Marco Ramilli Web CornerThury-Harcourt, France. Sender IPThe attached document is a well obfuscated Microsoft Word document which asks to enable macros in order to view its content. The autoopen function begins a complex obfuscated chain which tries to deter analyst by introducing junk code, junk variable assignments and fake apparent real comments. The following image proves the adopted obfuscation technique. The function c878cxx90590 is the “Real Code” by meaning is not part of junk code but actually is the function who really performs malicious actions. As you might see being in the middle of hundreds similar lines of code it gets hard to spot.Obfuscated MacroThe obfuscated macro creates on-memory objects and runs them without passing through temporary ﬁles. The following image shows the auto-run created object before the Drop’n Execute. The analysed variable in the following image is the c0639047895c6 which, in that speciﬁc run, holds the Win32_ProcessStartup created Object for fulﬁll persistence on the victim machine.url Emotet gang targeting companies with external SOC? – Marco Ramilli Web CornerObject BuildingOnce the dropper assured the persistence and to run during the start-up, it carves from itself the following powershell script. The script runs an encoded string hiding the dropping ULRs. The base64 decoded string shows a romantic foreach statement looping through a list of compromised websites hosting the real payload : ﬁnally saves the dropped ﬁle in a userproﬁle location as placed in the variable xc0x57b38b2x7 , before running it. The following image shows the powershell script before and after the encoding by giving a quick description on it.Final Deobfuscated Dropperurl Emotet gang targeting companies with external SOC? – Marco Ramilli Web CornerAccording to VT, the ﬁnal run looks like Emotet, a banking trojan who steals credentials, cookies and eCoin wallets. Emotet is also able to access to saved credentials of the major browser like Chromium, Firefox, Opera, Vivaldi to exﬁltrate cookies, and to send back to command and control found victim information. But let’s try to quickly check it. Analysis of dropped and executed ﬁle (emotet)Hash Emotet. Data Exﬁltration Dropped and Executed by previous stage3072:2xUIvﬂ2nnKJFddS2TZGjRurmOEfRtaG/70Jfm4JuLYwO9/+Tl:2lvfUn‐ KJFddhAjYrmOEpzcﬂQu1+The dropped ﬁle (VT 12/69), grabbed from the dropping URLs inside the previous powershell script, is an executable packed by internal functions which uses several techniques to avoid static and dynamic analysis. For example it deletes the original ﬁle once executed, it resolves an unusual very high number of APIs and it dynamically resolves functions avoiding static analysis.Emotet DepackedDuring the running phase the analyzed sample records many information on the hosting machine, it asks for local public IP address by querying an external resource: http[://185[.42[.221[.78:443/whoami.php and ﬁnally it pushes out those information to external Command and Control (please refer to IoC section for the complete C2 list).url Emotet gang targeting companies with external SOC? – Marco Ramilli Web CornerRecorded InformationThe sample starts a local service called khmerdefine and assures its persistence by adding that ﬁle in c:\Windows\SysWOW64 and setting up a system service in autorun. AV and plenty static trafﬁc signatures conﬁrm we are facing a new encrypted version of Emotet trojan. Conclusion Emotet gang is getting smarter and smarter in delivery artifacts. That time they addressed companies having an external Security Operation Center (SOC) pretending to simulate an external SOC operator who sends periodic reports to the company. The delivery content was a Microsoft word document within heavily obfuscated Macros who eventually drops and executes Emotet Malware.
