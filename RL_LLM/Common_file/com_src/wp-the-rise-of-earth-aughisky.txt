The group constantly updates5 malware routines tomanage security solutions’ developments and remain a formidable threat as the group improves6 itstactics. In the last decade, Earth Aughisky has deployed a number of associated malware to facilitate theirattacks, noted in their varying levels of sophistication.The group’s targets7 are primarily entities found in Taiwan,8 with our solutions’ sensors detecting 95%of their targeted victims located in the country. In recent years, however, we noticed Earth Aughisky’sactivities extending to Japan beginning in late 2017 and 2018.9Our sensors caught the first activities targeting Japan towards the end of 2017, matching public reportsof observed deployments in 2018. This additional targeting can also be seen to support the organizationalchanges discussed in the latter part of this research. Earth Aughisky mostly targets government institutions,followed by a significant number of enterprise victims10 in critical industries.11Government 57.7%Technology 4.3%Telecommunication 11.1%Transportation 3.7%Manufacturing 9.2%Heavy 6.7%Healthcare 1.2%Others 6.1%Figure 1. Earth Aughisky’s targets distributed by industry4 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor StartedSimilar to other APT groups, Earth Aughisky’s cyberespionage activities have been closely monitored andtracked. The group uses spear phishing as a common means of entry. Once inside their target’s systems,we observed varied efforts at evading detection, such as abusing legitimate user accounts and functions,leveraging weak network architecture designs, and deploying later-stage backdoors, to stay for as longas possible. While some agencies discuss the sensitivities and types of information the group exfiltrates,12others have kept these details confidential.Since then, a number of malware families associated with Earth Aughisky have been disclosed or discussedby different sources, while some have yet to be attributed, documented, or noticed. The following tablesummarizes the malware families we attribute to Earth Aughisky:NameBriefRoudan (also known as Taidoor)Earth Aughisky’s first attributed backdoor13Taleret (also known as Dalgan)Backdoor capable of searching for configurations on blogs or other repositories using the following formats:14, 15 • XXXXX[encrypted configuration]XXXXX • ARTEMIS[encrypted configuration]ARTEMISSerkdes (also known as Yalink)Backdoor identified in incidents involving Japanese organizationsDropNetClient/BuxzopKuangdao (also known as KD)Taikite (also known as Svcmondr)SpecasLuckDLLGrubbyRATK4RATASRWEC DownloaderIllitat DownloaderComeon downloaderSiyBotAbuses DropBox API to perform command and control (C&C) communication16Backdoor disclosed in 2020 by the name “Taidoor” loaded by a custom loader, MemoryLoad17, 18Mentioned in a report on CVE-2015-2545, this backdoor is dropped in the system by an executable file named svcmondr. exe.19Backdoor sometimes identified as Taleret or RoudanWe found this new backdoor and observed it as active since 2020.Backdoor with a separate configuration file, often observed in attacks involving critical industriesBackdoor that only contains some basic functionsDownloads the final malware payload from a blog (hxxp:// sites[.]google[.]com/site/yswbatthisurl/gua) or other repositories, and the encrypted payload follows the format yxyyyxyy[encrypted payload]yxyyyxyyCalls back to control server with path fc.asp and dw.html to download actual payloadDownloads actual payload from blog (kaiwanxiao[.]pixnet[.] net/blog/post/366093431) or other repositories following the format *****[encrypted payload]*****We discovered this backdoor abusing legitimate applications, such as Gubb or 30 Boxes, to perform C&C communication.5 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor StartedNameBriefTWTRATGOORATWe discovered this backdoor abusing social media Twitter’s direct message feature to perform C&C communication.We analyzed this backdoor searching for a command on blog or other repositories, with the format XXXXX[encrypted command]XXXXX.Table 1.

Observed malware usage per campaign target7 | The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor StartedMalwareThis section details our analysis for every malware, including their routines and significant characteristics.Roudan (Taidoor)Roudan is the classic Earth Aughisky malware that was disclosed over 10 years ago. Over the years,different formats have been used for callback traffic, which basically contains an encoded MAC addressand some random data. Detailed malware analysis are available in previous reports.Figure 3. Roudan network traffic, wherein 121212121212 is the encoded MAC address for010101010101. INTERNET_FLAG_SECURE is sometimes enabled since April 2018Although the name “Taidoor” has been adopted widely for years, threat actors actually name this malware“Roudan.” The term can be observed in looking at both backdoor and backdoor builder. A few samples contain a simplified Chinese version of Roudan, which is “肉弹” or “肉蛋” (although not exactly the same, found a special string in the C&C domain named “kuangd” or “kuangdao” (狂刀, meaning “madness 2 3Roudan41PittyTigerSiyBotASRWEC/Illitat/ComeonGOORATFigure 41.
