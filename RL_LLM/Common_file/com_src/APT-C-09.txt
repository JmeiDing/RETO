8/28/2019奇安信威胁情报中⼼ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/apt-c-09-reappeared-as-conﬂict-intensiﬁed-between-india-and-pakistanTIOverview Recently, an XLSM decoy document is captured by the RedDrip team of QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center by utilizing public intelligence. After taking a deeper analysis, we ﬁgure out that the C2 conﬁgurations are located on Github and Feed43. Multiple Github spaces have been exposed through correlation analysis and the earliest one could trace back to July 2018. The relevant accounts were still in use when the report was completed.Decryption algorithm for conﬁgurations retrieved from Github will be described in detail and the portrait of the attacker is partially based on statistics of the The related attack vector is an XLSM ﬁle, created on August 8 and uploaded to VT on August 13, that leverages CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability to release MSBuild.exe to the %AppData% directory and then add registry Run key to stay persistent. To obtain C2 address, it reads data from Github and Feed43 where the content could be controlled by attackers. HTTP/HTTPS protocols are used while communicating with available C2s. Dropper Analysis The sample was uploaded to VT at 5:05 on Aug 13, 2019 with below details:MD5 India makes Kashmir Dangerous Place in the World.xlsm 2019-08-13 05:05:15After opening, a blurred picture shows up to lure the victim to enable macro. After that, a clear picture titled "India has made Kashmir the most dangerous place in the world" gets displayed.Figure 2.1 Images before and after enabling macro In fact, the clear picture is covered with a vague one. When macro is enabled, the above picture will be deleted so that the clear one will be displayed:Figure 2.2 Content of the macro There is an OLE object embedded inside, and it seems that the attacker packed the .bak ﬁle by mistake:urlﬂict-intensiﬁed-between-india-and-pakistan/1/98/28/2019奇安信威胁情报中⼼Figure 2.3 The ole objects packed inside Shellcode inside the OLE object performs below functions:1.Correct the MZ header located at offset 0x558 of the shellcode entry point (add “MZ”)2.Drop the PE ﬁle to "%AppData%\MSBuild.exe".3.Add registry run key (key value: lollipop) to make "%AppData%\MSBuild.exe" persistent.Figure 2.4 Shellcode to correct the header MSBuild.exe Analysis MSBuild.exe is released to the %AppData% directory, and the compilation time is August 8th, 2019 which coincides with the XML creation time on Github that will be described later on:Name MD5 Compile TimeMSBuild.exe 2019-08-08 14:00:32The main purpose of this sample is to obtain C2 conﬁguration from the attacker's Github and feed43 space, and then performs decryption and connects to C2 for further communications.After the malicious code is executed, it will “sleep” for a period of time. This is implemented by executing function in a loop for 80,000 times, to delay execution in the sandbox:urlﬂict-intensiﬁed-between-india-and-pakistan/2/98/28/2019奇安信威胁情报中⼼Figure 3.1 Executing function in a big loop to achieve sleep purpose It checks network connectivity by connecting to “url", then retrieves C2 conﬁguration from two hard coded addresses (one works as a backup). The hard coded address is encrypted, each byte need to be subtracted by one to obtain the decrypted URL:Figure 3.2 Code to decrypt C2 conﬁgurationSource feed43 URL Github URLDecrypted Content url url Github account used by the attacker is created on August 7th, 2019, which matches the compilation time of the sample:urlﬂict-intensiﬁed-between-india-and-pakistan/3/98/28/2019奇安信威胁情报中⼼Figure 3.3 The attacker's Github home page The C2 conﬁguration is located inside the “description” ﬁeld after encryption:Figure 3.4 Github conﬁguration ﬁle content The Base64 encoded data get decoded ﬁrst, then performs ROL1((v11 + 16 * v9) ^ 0x23, 3) operation. After that, Base64 decode again and ﬁnally uses System information of the compromised computer will be collected and then exﬁltrated, AES encryption and Base64 encoding will be performed before sending out the collected data:urlﬂict-intensiﬁed-between-india-and-pakistan/URI Content uuid unID generated by GetCurrentHwProﬁle System info4/98/28/2019奇安信威胁情报中⼼cn Malware version, here it is 1.0After that the malware enters a while loop, to perform actions according to HTTP response:URI The following table is a comparison table of the received tokens and the functions to be performed:Token Function Upload keylog ﬁle Upload screen capture ﬁle Upload collected list of ﬁles for a speciﬁc sufﬁx Upload local ﬁle Extract EXE download link from URL, then download and execute.The attacker uploads the ﬁles generated after executing remote commands to the C&C server.

All C2s have been decrypted and extracted for investigation. From the time of ﬁle creation, the attacker started working at least as early as July 2018. The earliest created account was on July 3, 2018, and continued to August 2019 when the document was completed. In terms of the statistics of monthly creations, the number of creations in July 2018 is much higher than the follow-up. We give the following reasonable speculations based on the data distribution.The attacker may conduct a concentrated attack from July to September in 2018. Accounts are created on demand when the sample gets updated or related Github link is blocked.Figure 4.1 Conﬁguration ﬁle distribution Some extracted Github user names are listed as follows. We found that the names are generated based on some family names. So the attacks may be completed by multiple attackers considering the different names being used. Many IDs can be found on social media, and most of them are located in India and Pakistan:malikzafar786,Zunaid- zunaid1,a1amir1,Alaeck,aleks0rg0v,alexboycott,alfreednobeli,chrisyoks,dawoood,ehsaankhan,fakheragainfkhr,fangﬂee,habrew,hazkabeeb,husngilgit,imranikhan17,imrankhKeywords such as “android” and “mobile” are used in the Github directory, perhaps it indicates there are samples for Android phones.urlﬂict-intensiﬁed-between-india-and-pakistan/testy,test,amnigomestro,android,blch,cartoon,fashion,harrypotter,haz,helbrat,huric,husnahazrt,introduction,Joncorbat,kjhlkjhjkl,likingd,mdfs,metest,mobileapp,mobilegame,m6/9Most of the C2s are located in Ukraine while there are 2 IPs in China:8/28/2019奇安信威胁情报中⼼Figure 4.2 C2 distribution Statistics of XML creation time is provided in the below (the horizontal axis is the time of UTC+0, and the vertical axis is the number of occurrences).Figure 4.3 Attacker's 24-hour activity distribution Conclusion The link to feeds.rapidfeeds.com left in its XML conﬁguration ﬁle was also mentioned by Kaspersky’s report in the reference section, which conﬁrms that the APT-C-09 group keeps updating its C2 conﬁguration channel and the recent one reserves some past features.In the perspective of cyber wars, the conﬂict between India and Pakistan over the territory of Kashmir has lasted for decades, which makes it a perfect topic in target attacks. For example, Donot and Bitter disguised as Kashmiri Voice to attack Pakistan, Transparent Tribe attacked India with decoy document regarding terrorist attacks in Kashmir. These combats have proved that national power plays an important role in defending the national sovereignty and in the mean while spying on the military intelligence.India’s attempt to abolish India-controlled Kashmir is to detonate the conﬂict between the two countries. The two sides exchanged ﬁre and some soldiers have died because of this. In terms of cyber attacks, related incidences will continue to rise up. Considering APT-C-09, Bitter and Donot have carried out targeted attacks against China, we must take actions in advance and keep a close eye on their recent activities.QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center will provide customers with the latest attack trends in the ﬁrst time, helping government and enterprises to resist network intrusions from foreign enemies.
