Their campaigns are generally known for targeting Ukrainian government institutions. From late 2019 to February of this year, researchers published several reports on Gamaredon, tracking the group’s activities. In March, we came across an email with a malware attachment that used the Gamaredon group’s tactics. Some of the emails used the coronavirus pandemic as a topic to lure victims into opening emails and attachments. These campaigns targeted victims in European countries and others. A brief history of Gamaredon In 2015, researchers from LookingGlass published the ﬁrst report on Gamaredon. According to that report, the early campaigns used Microsoft Word documents that, when inspected, showed that its most recent user went by the name of Armagedon (a misspelled “Armageddon”), which became the basis of the group’s namesake. The report also described Gamaredon’s political beginnings, particularly its ties to the Ukrainian revolution in 2014. Before the revolution they had targeted Ukrainian government ofﬁcials, opposition party members, and journalists. They moved on to Ukrainian government institutions after the revolution. In 2018, CERT- UA published an advisory against the malware Pterodo, which the group allegedly used. The group remained active, with several Gamaredon-related activities reported in February 2020. In March, they were among the threat groups that were identiﬁed taking advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to trick targets. Gamaredon and Covid-19-related cover emailsurl… 1/74/27/2020Gamaredon APT Group Use Covid-19 Lure in Campaigns - TrendLabs Security Intelligence BlogFigure 1. The infection chain of the Gamaredon campaignThe case we found arrived through a targeted email that contained a document ﬁle (in docx format). Opening document starts a template injection technique for loading the document template from the internet. The downloaded document template contains the malicious macro codes, which executes a VBScript (VBS). We found a mechanism for decrypting, executing, and downloading an additional payload from the C&C server. During the time of the analysis however, the C&C server was not accessible, which made us unable to get additional payloads. The attacks we found all arrived through targeted emails (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1193). One of them even had the subject “Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).” The use of socially relevant topics is a common practice for attackers who wish to make their emails and documents more tempting to open. The email that used the coronavirus-related subject came with an attached document ﬁle. Opening this ﬁle (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1204) executes the template injection method (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1221).Figure 2. Code for downloading the document template with the malicious macroThe downloaded document template (in dot format) could differ slightly depending on each download. However, its Exif info or metadata remains consistent and shares the following details: Identiﬁcation: Word 8.0 Language code: Russian System: Windows Author: АДМИН (“Administrator” in Russian) Code page: Windows CyrillicFigure 3. A sample of malicious macro in the downloaded template documentAs mentioned, the template contains malicious macro (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1064), which exports VBS (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1064) to execute itself. More speciﬁcally it drops “%USERPROFILE%\Documents\MediaPlayer\PlayList.vbs,” which is hardcoded in the macro, and then executed in “wscript.exe //b %USERPROFILE%\Documents\MediaPlayer\PlayList.vbs.”PlayList.vbs contains the obfuscated codes (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1140), which it executes after decrypting the obfuscations. This particular behavior is a slight departure from previously reported attacks by Gamaredon, which did not use this technique.Figure 4.

The routines it follows are enumerated below.Figure 5. A sample of executed VBS1. Register the RUN key in the registry below, so that the VBS ﬁle is executed every time the machine starts (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1060)Registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce\MediaPlayer wscript.exe //b ％USERPROFILE%\Documents\MediaPlayer\PlayList.vbsT1043, T1071, T1082) framework ID T1105) decrypted result is saved as “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies.exe” (T1001)2.

If the downloaded ﬁle size in the ﬁrst step exceeds 10,485 bytes, then the ﬁle is saved as “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies.txt” (MITRE ATT&CK 4.

If the ﬁle size of “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies.exe” exceeds 4,485 bytes, it is executed. 6. Both “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies.txt” and “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies.exe” are then deleted (MITRE ATT&CKframework ID T1107)The observed routines of this VBS closely follow the other reports published on Gamaredon, such as the one from SentinelOne. However, the macro generated VBS was obfuscated in this case, likely as an additional evasive tactic. Interestingly, after decoding the VBS, we saw what appeared to be a programming mistake by the attacker. Lines 53 and 54 in ﬁgure 6 are for closing those downloaded and decoded TXT and EXE ﬁles, which are variables deﬁned right before the IF statement. If, however, these lines do not pass through this IF statement, an error would occur. It shows that this malware is not tested enough, and may still be under development. Our analysis found several URLs of the network destinations for both template injection and VBS. While resolving them to IP addresses to understand their attack bases, we also found that they were all linked to the following IP addresses.Network destination for template injection: 176[.]119[.]147[.]225 Network destination for VBS: 176[.]57[.]215[.]115These IP addresses are from Russian hosting companies. Most likely, the attackers rented Virtual Private Server (VPS) as their attack base. Their URL for VBS (shown below) likely includes the data when they conducted the attack.hxxp://{FQDN}/{computer name}_{hexadecimal volume serial number}/help_{day}_{month}[.]phpConclusion Gameradon is not the ﬁrst group to take advantage of the Covid-19 topic. Some cybercriminals have taken to indirect means of proﬁting, such as by targeting communication platforms that have increased in popularity after organizations shifted to work from home setups. In this case, they used Covid-19 as a cover for their relatively typical APT routine. We recommend these countermeasures to prevent similar APT attacks in the future:url… 3/74/27/2020Gamaredon APT Group Use Covid-19 Lure in Campaigns - TrendLabs Security Intelligence BlogCheck the email sender, subject, and body for anything suspicious before downloading and opening email attachments. Be especially wary of unsolicited emails, that come from unknown senders. Check the ﬁle extension of the attached ﬁle and make sure it is the intended ﬁle format. Avoid activating macro for any attached Microsoft Ofﬁce ﬁles, especially for emails that request macro activation using an image of the body of the opened ﬁle or those that don’t show anything. Watch out for spoofed domains embedded in emails before opening them.
