NOBELIUM’s EnvyScout infection chain goes in the registry, targeting embassiessekoia.io/en/nobeliums-envyscout-infection-chain-goes-in-the-registry-targeting-embassies6 January 2022NOBELIUM is another name for the APT29 intrusion set¹, operated by a threat actor allegedly linked to the SVR (the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation)². NOBELIUM has historically targeted government organizations, non-governmental organizations, think tanks, military, IT service providers, health technology and research, and telecommunications providers.Despite the low sophistication level of its phishing campaigns targeting Windows, NOBELIUM is well known for its agility once inside the victim’s network. Its operators are careful, patient and masterize cutting edge intrusion techniques against the latest Microsoft technologies and services such as AzureAD. For example, NOBELIUM used an home made passive implant dubbed FoggyWeb to exfiltrate authentication tokens from ADFS servers in a stealthy way³.NOBELIUM made the headlines a little over a year ago, following the discovery of a sophisticated supply chain attack against the Solarwinds software, compromising thousands by a validator dubbed “SunBurst”⁴. Beyond its impact and its sophistication, the attack – as disclosed by Kaspersky – had an interesting overlap with a backdoor used by TURLA⁴, an intrusion set that has been active for years and known to be allegedly linked to the Russian FSB. Joint operation between two Russian threat actors or NOBELIUM had access to the same code base? The question remains unanswered today but it is not the first time that overlaps between these two intrusion sets emerge⁵.Throughout 2021 and following the SolarWinds attack, NOBELIUM engaged spear phishing campaigns by using mails and social media messaging. These campaigns didn’t use any exploit to compromise Windows endpoints. They simply relied on malicious HTML attachments – called EnvyScout by Microsoft⁶– with a pinch of social engineering. By opening the attachment, the HTML file extracts from itself an ISO file by using a technique dubbed HTML Smuggling. The ISO is then downloaded by the victim and automatically mounted on the victim workstation, leading at the end of the exploitation chain to execution of a CobaltStrike beacon.New EnvyScout infection chain analysis. On October 21st, 2021, a new EnvyScout HTML file related to the NOBELIUM intrusion set ratio of 1 on 56. The rule was done on the possible obfuscated variants of a JavaScript loop used in the with the same MOTW comment⁷, such as:Extract 1. Headers in 32e0940e’ and 3d18bc4b’ filesAs seen during other phishing campaigns reported in open-source, this file uses “HTML Smuggling” technique to extract a malicious ISO file. By looking at its content, this file seems to have been targeted at content may have been deleted by the submitters in order to prevent victim identification. However, the next infection chain stage revealed that it targeted at least one Turkey Embassy. It is worth noting that these EnvyScout files don’t contain any SMB trap, web bug, telemetry script or redirection to some 0day exploit targeting iOS as previously seen by Google TAG⁸.2/9If we take a look at the ISO files metadata, the ISO volume name is the HTA file title and there are some interesting timestamps such as the “Root Directory Create Date” or the “Volume Create Date”. In the first (UTC time). Whereas in the second sample, which was uploaded a bit later on VirusTotal, the timestamps values are 2021:11:12 09:28:40-08:00 (UTC time).These dates indicate the last time that the volume was mounted. Which is quite interesting as the ISO files were actually simply extracted and decoded from the HTML files. It seems therefore likely that NOBELIUM built the payloads (or tested its whole attack chain) at these dates. If that is indeed the case, was uploaded to VirusTotal.Unlike the previously described NOBELIUM spear phishing attacks disclosed by Microsoft, the downloaded ISO files no longer contained a malicious DLL and a shortcut aimed to launch that DLL. In both cases, the ISO simply embeds a malicious HTML Application (HTA) file, executing the rest of the exploitation chain. For the HTA file corresponding to the first HTML file registry values. The first registry value carries out a shellcode loader written in PowerShell dedicated to decode and load a shellcode, contained in the second registry value. Once the values are saved in the registry, the HTA launch a Powershell command line which will load and execute the content of the first are deleted, a nice try to prevent forensic analysis. Furthermore, the registry key names differ in the two samples (Javasoft and MSOffice). In the two cases, the shellcode loads and executes in memory a DLL embedded in it. Both DLLs contain dozens of dead exports, are heavily obfuscated in the same manner with a lot of junk code and fake calls to the Windows API. They are used to decrypt and load an encrypted CS beacon splitted in seven different parts inside the DLL. To resume, they seem to act as the loader dubbed NativeZone (variant 1) as described by Microsoft in their blogpost⁶. to note that the public keys and the user-agent are the same. Furthermore, the user-agent should not be used often in real corporate environments as it is associated with Windows 8 and you could therefore look for that on your networks for hunting purposes.Two different C2s have been extracted, midcitylanews[.]com for the sample targeting Iran and dom- news[.]com for the sample targeting Turkey.Infrastructure analysis5/9The domains midcitylanews[.]com and dom-news[.]com retrieved from the CobaltStrike beacons have been registered more than a year prior their use by the threat actor which could indicate that NOBELIUM tried to prevent malicious domains detection based on their creation date.These domains resolved VPS IP addresses having their 80 and 443 ports open. They seem to have been configured by using an Nginx forwarder configuration for CobaltStrike C2 dubbed “cs2nginx” and available for anyone on Github⁹.However, even if the domains were registered a year ago, the associated C2 servers were setted up around the end of september, 2021. Therefore, this time delta, the use of cs2nginx and the pattern of the typosquatting domains (e.g. the use on “news” keyword for many of them) can lead to some infrastructure illumination. Here is the infrastructure which can be grabbed by using this heuristic.Table 3. Infrastructure discovered possibly linked to NOBELIUMIt is interesting to note that as the infrastructure disclosed by the CERT-FR in December, 2021¹⁰, this cluster is distributed between several autonomous systems, which seems also to be one characteristic of NOBELIUM.During this investigation, we found other C2s servers using the same technique and potentially linked to other threat actors or red teams. We decided to publish this list in the appendix for threat hunting purposes in your network.Conclusion The infection chain and the indicators shown above suggest that NOBELIUM is associated with this attack campaign. After having burned EnvyScout against occidental targets, NOBELIUM seems to reuse6/9this infection chain against other countries. However, due to the low complexity of the infection chain and the previous blog posts covering EnvyScout, it could be, although we write this with very low confidence, just another threat actor copycatting NOBELIUM.External references ¹ Alert (AA21-148A) Sophisticated Spearphishing Campaign Targets Government Organizations, IGOs, and NGOs, CISA, May 28, 2021 ² Further TTPs associated with SVR cyber actors, NCSC, May 7, 2021 ³ FoggyWeb: Targeted NOBELIUM malware leads to persistent backdoor, Microsoft, September 27, 2021 ⁴ SUNBURST Additional Technical Details, Mandian, December 24, 2020 ⁵ Sunburst backdoor – code overlaps with Kazuar, Kaspersky, January 11, 2021 ⁶ Breaking down NOBELIUM’s latest early-stage toolset, Microsoft, May 28, 2021 ⁷ Mark of the Web, Microsoft, May 11, 2015 ⁸ How we protect users from 0-day attacks, Google TAG, July 12, 2021 ⁹ Cs2modrewrite’s source code on Github ¹⁰ Phishing campaigns by the Nobelium intrusion set, CERT-FR, December 6, 2021 Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) T1583.001 – Acquire Infrastructure: Domains T1583.003 – Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server T1566.001 – Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment T1566.003 – Phishing: Spearphishing via Service T1059.001 – Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell T1204.002 – User Execution: Malicious File T1027.006 – Obfuscated Files or Information: HTML Smuggling T1071.001 – Application Layer Protocol: Web ProtocolsRelated IOCs The IOCs are provided “as is”.
