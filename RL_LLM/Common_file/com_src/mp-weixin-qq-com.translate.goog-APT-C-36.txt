Relying on 360 Security Brain's tens of billions of samples, trillions of protection logs and other massive security data, it integrates 360 vulnerability mining, malicious code analysis, and threat intelligence tracking. and other teams' security capabilities to produce high-quality security threat intelligence to drive security defense, detection, and response.APT-C-36 blind eagle APT-C-36 (Blind Eagle) is an APT organization suspected to be from South America. Its main targets are located in Colombia and some areas in South America, such as Ecuador and Panama. Since its discovery in 2018, the organization has continued to launch targeted attacks against Colombian government departments, financial, insurance and other industries, as well as large companies.APT-C-36 often uses harpoon attacks recently, using PDF files as entry points to induce users to click malicious links in the documents to download RAR compressed files. Most compressed files need a password to decompress. The password is basically a 4-digit pure number. After decompression, it is a VBS script disguised as a PDF file name. After the VBS script is clicked and executed by the user, it will start a complex and multi-stage fileless attack chain. The final loader is an obfuscated AsyncRAT or NjRAT Trojan, and the code to bypass the AMSI mechanism is added, which shows that the organization is constantly optimizing its attack weapon.1. Attack activity analysis 1. Attack process analysis1/9The figure above shows the complete attack flow of some payloads of this attack. The attacker induces the user to download the malicious compressed package file, executes the VBS script in it, and loads the first-stage DLL downloaded from the remote end into memory, and the DLL continues to load the second-stage DLL in memory. In order to hide the final malicious code, the second-stage DLL will inject the AsyncRAT or NjRAT Trojan into the puppet process RegAsm or AppLaunch.exe for execution. The last loaded Trojan program establishes communication with the C2 server to realize the remote control function. It should be noted that attackers often use mail servers or text storage service websites (such as Paste.ee) to save the payload in order not to be intercepted when downloading the attack payload. 2. Load delivery analysisMost of the samples captured this time are compressed files, and some samples require a 4-digit pure digital password to decompress, and the functions of the decompressed files are similar.The following takes one of the malicious sample files as an example to introduce its attack chain in detail.Radicado%20%231-2022- file name is very long, and the suffix is pdf.rar, so users can easily click on it without paying attention to get tricked. In addition, the content of the VBS file is full of a large amount of useless data and obfuscated malicious code, and the word "Updated" can be clearly seen. It can be speculated that the attack took place after September 15, 2022.The key codes obtained by de-obfuscation are as follows:Malicious code downloads the encoded DLL data from the address url , calls the Fiber.Home.VAI method, implements reflective loading of the DLL, and passes in parameters, the parameters are in reverse order of the URL (URL: url .cmconcretos.com/home/cartera@cmconcretos.com/Briefcase/prueba4.txt?disp=a&ver=1) as the first stage loader. from url , replaces the specified string and decodes it to get the second-stage DLL file. Then call the Fsociety.Tools.Ande method of the second stage DLL, the parameter is "C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework \\v4.0.30319 \\RegAsm.exe " (injected program) and the final malicious redeveloped and obfuscated by SmartAssembly. AsyncRAT is an open source remote control Trojan horse program written in C# language. Its functions include process monitoring, file management, remote desktop, keylogging and other remote control functions. It also includes anti-virtual machine, anti-debugging, anti-sandbox, etc. a countermeasure technique.After the payload is executed, first call Settings.InitializeSettings to load the configuration information, obtain the Key through Base64 decoding, and then use the AES algorithm to decrypt to obtain important configurations such as Ports, Host, Version, Install, MTX, Anti information.4/9configuration strekhost2043.duckdns.org 0.5.7B F610C7F4363913D3C16EAccording to the Anti attribute of the configuration file, it is decided whether to detect the environment, mainly to detect Vmware and VirtualBox virtual machines, anti-debugging, sandbox, hard disk capacity, and whether it is an XP system.Determine whether PasteBin is empty, if it is empty, take the host information (domain name/IP) and port from the configuration information, check the validity of the host, and then connect. If PasteBin is not empty, use ":" as the separator to connect to the host information and port respectively. It can be seen that the C2 of the RAT has strong scalability and flexibility.5/9After the SSL connection is established between the client and the server, the HWID (hardware ID), User (user name), OS and other host information of the controlled machine are collected by calling the IdSender.SendInfo() method.In addition, the remote control Trojan program contains multiple functional modules, mainly including file management, file search, keylogging, process management, remote desktop, remote camera, etc. These functions exist as modules alone, and do not exist in the client program. According to the required functions, different modules are sent to the client, and the corresponding functions are executed on the client.module Chat.dll Extra.dllFileManager.dll Miscellaneous.dllOptions.dll Pop-up window, access Url, close USB, DOS, torrent, Shell, DotNet code execution exit, restart, reportWindow memory loadIt is important to note that when analyzing other attack components, we found that some AsyncRAT payloads have added codes to bypass AMSI, mainly by hooking the AmsiScanBuffer function in amsi.dll to return a normal result, thereby bypassing detection and allowing Its malicious program executes normally.6/92. Correlation analysisThis attack sample is very similar to the attack samples we captured in the first half of this year, and both belong to the APT-C-36 organization. The attack payload information discovered in the first half of the year is as follows:file name File size MD5multas transit-jpg.bz2 9.09KB attack process of this attack. It also adopts the method of multi-stage loading of the final open source RAT. The difference is that the DLL in the first stage is decrypted locally, not loaded from the remote end, and the open-source Trojan horse NjRAT is finally injected.In addition, it should be noted that the RAR decompression password and download links are often provided through PDF disguised documents. As shown in the figure below, the victim is induced to click on the URL that is actually a malicious short link (url to download the RAR compressed file, and reminds the compressed file that the password is 2022, inducing the user to open the malicious file.7/9Combined with the previous delivery methods of the APT-C-36 organization, there is every reason to believe that the delivery of this payload is also through such documents to lure users to click and download the compressed package. Unfortunately, this time it is not completely related to the relevant decoy files. In addition, a malicious program hosted by the organization on the cmconcretos.com mail server was discovered during this sample traceability analysis. These programs were uploaded around September 22, 2022, and are constantly being updated, indicating that the attack occurred just before the time at this stage.The RAR compressed package in the server basically needs a password (4-digit pure number) to open, and the file name is in Spanish, and after decompression, it is also a VBS script with a long file name with the word PDF. Through analysis, we found a download link url in one of the compressed packages, indicating that the malicious code was placed on the paste.ee platform, and the organization once hosted the malicious code on the pastebin platform , the difference being that the former is used without restriction. In addition, the mailbox server and C2 are basically located in Colombia, and the source of some samples is shown as Colombia. Combined with the entire attack chain of the sample, it is consistent with the attack characteristics and goals of the APT-C-36 organization. In summary, we have reasons to attribute it to the APT-C-36 (Blind Eagle) organization.SummarizeThe APT-C-36 (Blind Eagle) organization has been attacking Colombia and surrounding countries for a long time, and hosts some malicious codes on public service platforms such as paste.ee and mail servers to hide the traces of the attack. At the same time, in response to the ever-improving security defense detection system, the organization modified and confused various types of open-source Trojans (such as NjRAT and SyncRAT) to meet the needs of different scenarios. The Trojans used in this attack were confused by SmartAssembly , and part of the payload added code that bypasses the AMSI mechanism, which all indicate that the organization is continuously updating the function and form of the malicious code, and presents the characteristics of functionalization and modularization.In addition, the relevant malicious code and C2 disclosed in this article are only the latest weapons used in some attacks by the APT-C-36 (Blind Eagle) organization, and we will continue to pay attention to the attack activities of this8/9organization in the future.Appendix IOC URL:url [ . ] com/attachments/958218348804587533/963037127979958332/1988ENVIOS.txt Domain:remcosos.duckdns.org:1988strekhost2043.duckdns.org:4203strekhost2043.duckdns.org:42059/9
