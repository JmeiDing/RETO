The Operations of Winnti group Threat Detection NTT Ltd TLP: WHITE .29 April 2021The Operations of Winnti Group Threat Detection NTT Ltd.1. OverviewThreat actor Winnti Group tracked by NTT Security Threat Intelligence analysts as Entity-1 (ENT-1) is a highly active group with many parallel operations mainly targeted towards entities in Asia. The definition and classification of activity originating from the Winnti group diverge between various security companies, what we label as ENT-1 in this report overlaps activity classified by ESET and Dr Web as Winnti group in recent reporting [1][2][5].The aim of this report is to offer a glimpse into the continuous Threat Intelligence efforts NTT Security are committed to on behalf of our clients , while also reporting on previously unreported aspects of the EN T-1 group in contribution to the security- communities effort of laying the puzzle of ENT-1 activity.This research has been possible by harnessing NTT’s owned and operated global tier- 1 IP backbones, together with correlation of data from targeted customers, internal research and open source intelligence (OSINT) .The timespan of this research is from December 2020 to April 2021 where the following countries and regions has been observed as targets:Figure 1 Targeted countries and regions December 2020 to April 2021© NTT LimitedPage 2 of 10The Operations of Winnti Group Threat Detection NTT Ltd.2.Daily operationsAnalysis of traffic towards ENT-1 infrastructure shows that the group is active during office-hours in time zone UTC+6. Weekends normally lack any activity implying that the group is truly a full-time funded APT group.Figure 2 Intensity of ENT-1 activity in UTC+6The groups daily operations include the exploitation of servers running the GlassFish Server software version 3.1.2 and below as means for easy infrastructure expansion. The exploited servers are then utilized during their operations:Figure 1 ENT-1 GlassFish WorkflowCommonly deployed software includes the Web Vulnerability Scanner Acunitex and the command-and-control product CobaltStrike.3.Acunitex activityThe web vulnerability scanning activity covers geographical sectors and industries typically associated with the ENT-1 interest sphere. Our observation is a strong focus on the Media sector located in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan. Travel and© NTT LimitedPage 3 of 10The Operations of Winnti Group Threat Detection NTT Ltd.Transportation companies operating out of Hong Kong. Government infrastructure in Australia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Vietnam, Japan and Macao. Universities and telecom operators in Bahrain and Kuwait have also been targeted.Figure 3 Targeted industriesWhile the scanning is targeted in respect to sector and geographical location it also appears to be opportunistic. Organisations which have been scanned by any of the Acunitex IPs listed in the IOC section should expect and protect from further intrusion attempts performed by ENT-1 and/or related APT groups which possibly have been provided with the same target list.4.CobaltStrike infrastructureThe CobaltStrike infrastructure shows different variations of customization where publicly available (malleable) or default profiles are sometimes used but also more advanced methods are observed. Typosquat domains and certificates are commonly utilized to make the traffic blend in. For example, a self-signed certificate imitating Glassfish servers. This could be due to CobaltStrike being utilized as the first layer backdoor during campaigns where the more well -known ENT-1 utilized backdoors such as Shadowpad, Spyder and the Winnti backdoor are deployed as a second stage payload on interesting victims. This behaviour indicates that the Glassfish servers are seen as use-and-throw away C2s.More ambitious efforts of CobaltStrike usage is a custom stager called Fishmaster according to the embedded PDB path:© NTT LimitedPage 4 of 10The Operations of Winnti Group Threat Detection NTT Ltd.Figure 5 PDB path for Browser_Plugin.exeAvast classifies the sample as “Win64:BidenHappy-A [Apt]”, likely due to the embedded string:Figure 6 Embedded string in Fishmaster sampleThe sample were hosted at hxxps://jquery-code[.]ml/Download/Browser_Plugin.exe and at the index page of the domain the html loads an iframe of code.jquery.com in order to appear legitimate:Figure 7 Observed iframe usageThe stager will request a pdf from a Cobalt Strike C2 on the URL path hxxp://37.61.205[.]212:8880/dow/Aili.pdf and store it to “C:\Users\Public\Aili.pdf”. The pdf holds a job-application in Mandarin for a Vietnamese individual:Figure 8 Job application© NTT LimitedPage 5 of 10The Operations of Winnti Group Threat Detection NTT Ltd.Secondly the stager will request the CobaltStrike related destination hxxp://micsoftin[.]us:2086/dow/83.dmp, part of the response is XOR encoded with the key “misgat_mg” which the stager will decode and executed as shellcode. We have been unable to download the 83.dmp payload but explain the payload structure below:Figure 9 Format of likely CobaltStrike beacon payloadThe use-case behind the downloaded pdf is unknown and we encourage fellow researchers to explore it in depth for the possibility of it holding command and control traffic. The adoption of Fishmaster still appears relatively low and it remains to be seen if it will become an integral of the groups toolset.5.Shadowpad, Spyder and Winnti backdoor utilizationENT-1 extensively use Shadowpad, Spyder and the Winnti backdoor for long-running operations. It is not unseen that the group keep on using domains and IPs even after they have publicly been reported, for example the following domains are still actively used even though they are publicly reported:--livehost[.]live (Reported by ESET 31th Jan 2020 [1], still utilized Apr 2021)symantecupd[.]com (Reported by PTSecurity Jan 2021 [3], still used Apr 2021)ENT-1 has also utilized snoc.hostingupdate[.]club which is reported by Dr Web as a Spyder C2, Spyder is a backdoor reported to be utilized by Winnti Group [5].Given the large infrastructure overlaps and shared toolset utilization NTT Threat as hosting-grounds for ENT-1 payloads. On Virustotal some samples are uploaded, among them a malicious lnk shortcut named “Business Registration_JHUAN SHUN MOTOR CO., LTD.pdf.lnk” targeted towards a Taiwanese entity.© NTT LimitedPage 6 of 10The Operations of Winnti Group Threat Detection NTT Ltd.Another clue towards Taiwanese targeting is a previously hosted self-extracting archive with “TW” in the filename:Figure 10 flashplayerpp_install_tw.exe execution flow7.ConclusionENT-1 shows signs of being a full-time funded APT group with a continuously diversified toolset and a growing network infrastructure to support their operations.8.How NTT Can helpNTT Security Threat Intelligence researchers are monitoring telemetry of suspicious traffic traversing our Global IP Network Service global tier -1 IPv4/IPv6 backbone network for threat indications. Correlating such findings with the insights of our global Advanced Threat Detection (ATD) and Managed Detection and Response (MDR) services enable a truly unique and global perspective of the continuously evolving cyber security threat landscape.Research findings on threat actors and campaigns, such as ENT-1, are continuously being feed from our Threat Intelligence analyst back into our services as Machine- Learning capabilities, Behaviour models, Indicators -of-Compromise(IOC)’s and Threat Intelligence.
