To fulfill the demands of offensive cyberattacks, an industry has emerged that can sell tools, services and training to governments, corporations, organized crime and even wealthy individuals. Cybermercenaries are part of this industry, and in return for their services, they get monetary rewards or other benefits.The problems that these cybermercenaries cause are getting more profound and are gaining more attention in recent years. While the services of cybermercenaries may theoretically be of use in the fight against terrorism and organized crime in well-established jurisdictions that have democratic control mechanisms and export controls in place, in practice, we see that the services of these cybermercenaries are being used to attack political opposition, dissidents, journalists, and human rights activists. 1, 2Offensive tools are used to spy on these targets — and this can have devastating consequences. For example, some politicians and journalists who saw no other option than to flee their home country became the target of aggressive cyberattacks around the same time they decided to go into exile.3 These attacks might have been the final straw that forced them to flee the country.The problem with selling cybermercenary services goes deep, even when they are intended for use in narrow, ultra-targeted campaigns. Offensive tools and methodologies may become widely available when advanced malware and knowledge of vulnerabilities are stolen in hacks and then leaked. For example, in 2015, a well-known hacker-for-hire organization in Italy became the victim of a hack and its tools were made available to anybody who wanted to learn how to use them.4To mitigate the risks to society that these cybermercenaries’ actions cause, there have been calls to regulate the cybermercenary industry with international agreements and laws.5, 6 These proposals, however, are difficult to implement because countries with different points of view would have to come to an agreement about what such regulations would look like and how it gets enforced. Even when worldwide regulations are in place, there will still be large gray areas where all kinds of actors can offer their services. Moreover, nations might view cybermercenaries that have headquarters in their own country as a national asset. Not only can these cybermercenaries be used for attacks that are aligned with the interests of their home country, but they can also be used as a political tool for foreign policy, just like conventional weapons.This research looks into a threat actor group that can be considered a cybermercenary, but one that prefers to stay in the shadows. To our knowledge, this hacker-for-hire group does not operate out of a physical building, nor does it have a shiny prospectus that describes its services. The group does not try to wriggle out of a difficult position by justifying its business, nor is it involved in lawsuits against anybody attempting to report on their activities. Instead,this group is quite open about what it does: breaking into email accounts and social media accounts for money. This threat actor is also involved in selling highly sensitive personal data like cell tower phone logs, passenger flight records, banking data, and passport details.The group advertises its services in Russian-speaking underground forums such as Probiv, where cybercriminals gather to do business with each other. At first glance, it seems that this hacker-for-hire mostly has customers whose main motive is financial gain. However, we can also attribute significant political attacks against human rights activists and politicians in about a dozen countries to this group.The Russian-speaking threat actor calls itself Rockethack. While we do not know this group’s whereabouts, we have a good knowledge of its working hours. We suspect that Rockethack possesses detailed knowledge of how telecommunications and ISPs work in Russia and neighboring countries.Rockethack has a massive associated intrusion set with thousands of indicators, which we are tracking under the name Void Balaur. We chose this name because Balaur is a monstrous multiheaded legendary creature in Eastern European folklore. It is fittingly symbolic for the multiple purposes for which Void Balaur is being hired: spying on a local shop in Moscow, on journalists, human right activists, politicians, scientists, doctors working in a few dozen IVF clinics, genomics and biotechnology companies, Telco engineers with deep knowledge of mobile operators’ networks, and business aviation companies. Void Balaur also dabbles in corporate espionage, is suspected to be selling data to cybercriminals in order to fight their fellow cybercriminals over disputes, and has conducted attacks against cryptocurrency users.We have uncovered more than 3,500 of the group’s targets, some of whom have suffered long-lasting and repeated attacks. Our research revealed a clear picture: Void Balaur goes after the most private and personal data of businesses and individuals then sells that data to whomever wants to pay for it. This business model is perhaps best illustrated by the mottos the group has been using on the now defunct website, rockethack[.]me. The actor group used a couple of remarkable mottos in this website. One was:Деньги не главное в свободном интернете. Главное – власть, которая принадлежит тому, кто контролирует потоки информации.This translates to:Money is not the main thing on the free internet. The main thing is the power that belongs to the one who controls the flow of information.The motto is taken from the book “Code of Durov. The Real Story of the Social Network “VKontakte” and its Creator (2012),” written by the Russian journalist Nikolay Kononov. This book is about Pavel Durov, the founder of the Russian social networking site Vk.com and the messenger platform Telegram.Later, the group used a different motto:Вся информация мира — это сплетни. Если умеешь их слушать, то можно научиться и вычленять истину.Which translates to:All information in the world is gossip. If you know how to listen to them, then you can learn and isolate the truth.This motto comes from another book, “False Mirrors,” by Sergey Lukyanenko. Lukyanenko is a Russian science fiction author who has voiced political views on Ukraine and Russian countermeasures against the Magnitsky Act.Both mottos reflect the nature of Void Balaur’s business: the cybermercenary not only will steal highly sensitive information from individuals and businesses on demand, but it also seems to be hungry for data itself. Before a customer asks for a new service, Void Balaur may already be thinking about how it can get more personal and private data. Throughout various industries, we saw that Void Balaur targets key employees of corporations who probably have access to large amounts of personal data.The Starting Point of Our InvestigationWhile many countries around the world were in lockdown during March 2020 to combat the rapidlyincreasing Covid-19 infection numbers, we were contacted by a long-time target of Pawn Storm, anAdvanced Persistent Threat (APT) group also known as APT28.7 This person told us that his wife, whoworks as a scientist, had received a dozen phishing emails on her Gmail account.Figure 1. Gmail phishing emails that the spouse of a long-time Pawn Storm target received in 20206 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s ActivitiesFigure 2. Credential phishing email stating that the recipient must pay off a debt andmust appear in courtWe were immediately alarmed: this would not be the first time Pawn Storm targeted the spouses of theiractual targets.8 However, a closer look at the phishing emails did not show any of the usual indicatorsand modus operandi that we have attributed to Pawn Storm during the intensive research we have beenconducting on the group since 2014. The phishing emails, which the spouse received in March 2020, didnot point to Pawn Storm, but they did lead us to another attribution set that we later named Void Balaur.In this attribution set, we found the domain name rockethack[.]me, which belonged to a hacking servicethat advertises in underground forums such as Probiv under the name “Rockethack.” Throughout the restof this report, we will refer to this hacking service as Void Balaur.Void Balaur offers services for hacking into the email mailboxes of several email providers and socialmedia accounts for money (and possibly other benefits). For some email providers like rambler.ru andmail.ru, the group offers services at a premium rate where complete copies of mailboxes are stolenwithout any user interaction. We have no reason to believe that the latter is not a real business offering.This means that in some cases, Void Balaur can access mailboxes without the user noticing it. How theydo this will be discussed in a later section.DomainRegistrantDescription27g4dwjallqnzu0[.]spacePrivacy protectedSpam URLaccount-googl[.]compoxxpoz@pm.meSender domainbflqj2xmpbwqkzpwg[.]funPrivacy protectedSpam URLizwg17taoz9noedve[.]xyzPrivacy protectedSpam URLmyaccount.mail.sessionverify.com[.]ruPrivacy protectedPhishing siteoapjiyfybhj0jszll[.]funPrivacy protectedSpam URLwnppid4qunpuwuvqk[.]funPrivacy protectedSpam URLyen9y2flnrcbwsvy9[.]funPrivacy protectedSpam URLTable 1.

A small selection of domains in the large intrusion set of Void Balaur8 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s ActivitiesTable 3 suggests that the targets of Void Balaur are quite diverse. We see hostnames that look likegeneric phishing hostnames, a domain name that resembles a well-known cryptocurrency exchange, twodomains that are related to business aviation companies in Russia. and a domain that was mentioned ina report by eQualitie on notable attacks against human right activists in Uzbekistan.11The next sections will show that these apparent low-confidence relations are not a coincidence, butpart of Void Balaur’s long-term campaigns. We will show that Void Balaur is not only into hacking emailmailboxes but is also in the business of selling the sensitive private information of its targets. This includescell tower log data, passport details, SMS messages, and more. In addition, Void Balaur appears to targetmany organizations and individuals that are likely to have access to highly sensitive data on people.9 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s ActivitiesVoid Balaur in the UndergroundThe earliest reference to Void Balaur we could find in underground forums dates back to September 8,2017. On that day, complaints about spam advertising Void Balaur’s services (under the name Rockethack)were posted on the underground forum exploit.in. The actual contents of the spam message from 2017stated that Void Balaur had already been selling its services via resellers in the past, so it is likely that VoidBalaur was in the hacker-for-hire business before 2017. This corresponds with digital traces we were ableto find that pointed to the group’s activities in September 2015 (see Appendix C).It took another six months before Void Balaur started placing paid advertisements in underground forumslike Darkmoney and Probiv. Probiv, which was established in 2014, acts as an underground marketplacewhere malicious actors gather to offer specialized services mostly aimed at providing access to data,making it an ideal place for Void Balaur to advertise. Darkmoney, meanwhile, is an underground forumfor carders. Void Balaur also advertised their services on Tenec, an underground forum specializing inmonetizing stolen credentials, and Dublikat — yet another underground forum.The feedback that Void Balaur receives on underground forums is unanimously positive. Posters mentionthat the hacking service delivers the requested information on time, while others commented positivelyon the quality of the delivered information from mailboxes. Yet others posted about passport details theyhad requested.To our knowledge, Void Balaur has never advertised in underground forums that were not Russianlanguage-oriented. However, there used to be a website on rockethack[.]me that was registered onFebruary 21, 2018 and was available on its bare IP address 139.60.163[.]53 until at least December2020. On the website, Void Balaur listed services such as hacking into mailboxes or flooding them withspam, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and flooding phone numbers (in Commonwealth ofIndependent States or CIS countries only).10 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s ActivitiesEmail providerGmailProtonmailMail.ruRambler.ruAmount in March2021 (RussianRubles)Amount inSeptember 2017 (Russian Rubles)> 40,000 (US$550)> 25,000 (US344$)> 50,000 (US$688)-10,000 (US$138)4,000 (US$55)12,000 (US$165)4,000 (US$55)Rambler.ru (no hack)-60,000 (US$826)Yandex.ru12,000 (US$165),5000 (US$69)Yandex.ru (no hack)> 20,000 (US$275)> 30,000 (US$413)Vk.com10,000 (US$138)8,000 (US$110)Vk.com (hijacking without password change)> 20,000 (US$275)> 80,000 (US$1,101)Telegram150,000 (US$2,064)-Corporate email> 30,000 (US$413)>10,000 (US$138)Table 4.

The website of Void Balaur (under the name Rockethack) in 2020 when it was still available on its bare IP address. At the time we took a screenshot, the website had a motto in Russian that isattributed to Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO and founder of Facebook. We have not been able to verify theauthenticity of this quote.11 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s ActivitiesFigure 4. Offerings from the website of Void Balaur in 2020The main activities of Void Balaur that were initially advertised on underground forums were breaking intofree webmail, social media, and corporate email accounts. Copies of mailboxes were being offered bothwith and without user interaction. Most likely, the option to deliver data with user interaction happensvia credential phishing, and when needed, includes two-factor authentication. For some Russian emailproviders, copies of mailboxes are offered without any user interaction. We have no reason to doubtthat this is a real business offering, because we have not seen negative feedback on Void Balaur inunderground forums. We don’t know how customer data like emails are stolen without user interaction,but there are some scenarios where this would be possible. Note that these are only our conjectureson how the information is stolen; Void Balaur could have used other methods to gather data from theirtargets without user interaction.• Key employees of email providers are knowingly selling data — either directly or indirectly — to theactors behind Void Balaur.• Key employees who have legal access to mailboxes have been compromised.•Law enforcement personnel who may have legal access to mailboxes are compromised.• The computer systems of the email provider have security issues or have been breached.• The group uses databases with leaked credentials to access mailboxes without user interaction.12 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s ActivitiesNaturally, the service that retrieves emails without user interaction is offered at a premium rate. We wereunable to establish how they can offer this kind of data.Starting in 2019, Void Balaur advertised the sale of very private and sensitive data of individuals fromRussia in underground forums. For example:Type of InformationInformation on Russian passports, foreign passports, marriage certificates, and N1 formsInformation on purchased tickets where a passport is needed (train, bus, airlines, and ferries).

Some of the offerings on sensitive personal data that Void Balaur is advertising in undergroundforums. Starting prices are in Russian rubles. We added equivalent US Dollar amounts based on theexchange rate on September 14, 2021The telecom data that Void Balaur is peddling includes phone call records with cell tower locations thatcould reveal who a person has been calling, the duration of the calls, and the approximate location wherethe calls were made. Knowledge of these details could serve several purposes, including committingserious crimes. Furthermore, blocking phone numbers, a service that Void Balaur also offers, can helpfacilitate serious crimes — for example, by ensuring that someone is unreachable by phone while thecrime is taking place.The price for getting phone call records with or without cell tower information varies a lot between differentRussian providers, up to about a factor of ten. Apparently, getting phone records from some telecomcompanies are much easier than from others.We are not sure how they obtain such sensitive private data — it’s possible that they get it by paying bribesto insiders in the telecom companies. This scenario was supported by a media article that was publishedin 2019 by BBC Russia.12 Other possible scenarios are that key engineers of telecom operators are beinghacked or that the network of telecom companies is being compromised. During our research, we foundsupporting evidence for the former: Void Balaur has been targeting key engineers and management ofvarious mobile telco companies, as shown in Table 6.14 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s ActivitiesTargetCountryDeputy director of core telco networkSenior manager of telecom companySenior telco network engineerRussiaRussiaRussiaSenior telco network engineerUS/RussiaDateAug 2021May 2021Mar 2021Nov 2020Senior telco network engineerUS/Russia/Israelbefore Jun 2020Founder of a mobile virtual network operatorUK/RussiaMobile satellite communications operatorManufacturer of cellular equipment 1Manufacturer of cellular equipment 2Radio navigation company 1Radio navigation company 2Radio navigation company 3Radio navigation company 4RussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaMay 2021May 2021Dec 2020Oct 2021Jul 2020 – May 2021Apr 2021May 2021May 2021Table 6. Noteworthy Void Balaur targets in the telecom industry. For one target, we only have anapproximate target dateIn December 2020, reports were released on the investigative journalism website Bellingcat alleging thatthere are direct relations between persons working for an intelligence agency and attempted assassinations.As part of their investigation, Bellingcat journalists bought private flight data from a service that advertiseson Probiv.13 We do not know the exact data sources that these investigative journalists used, but wedo know that Void Balaur offers telecom and passenger flight record data, which was possibly one ofthe sources used by the journalists (and we also know that Void Balaur advertises on Probiv, which wementioned earlier).Naturally, the allegations generated a lot of attention in international media. In addition, the news reportswere discussed in underground forums as well. In a posting on an underground forum, Void Balaurexpressed concern about the allegations, as they could be a threat to its business.One message posted by Void Balaur roughly translates to “Do you think they [Russian LE] will try to discoverthe whole chain, or just calm down the noise [generated by the media reports]?” This shows that VoidBalaur was concerned about potential backlash. However, we did not notice any visible consequences.To our knowledge, Void Balaur did not slow down its services during the time international media showeda higher interest in underground forums like Probiv.15 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s ActivitiesFigure 5. A Void Balaur post in the underground forum Probiv published on December 18, 2020. Theposter expressed concerns about an investigative journalists claims of being able to buy airlinepassenger and cell tower data on Probiv.16 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s ActivitiesVoid Balaur’s TargetsDuring our research we were able to collect a significant amount of information on Void Balaur’s campaigns.We found more than 3,500 email addresses for individuals and companies that the group targeted.We do not have a list of the users of Void Balaur’s services, but we do know about customers whocommented positively on the group’s services in semi-public underground posts. These customerswere satisfied with the services that Void Balaur provided, such as breaking into email boxes, providinginformation on passports, breaking into Telegram accounts, and offering sensitive telco information.These customers were active participants in underground forums like tenec.cc, Probiv and Darkmoney.We suspect, however, that the more important customers of Void Balaur are not active participants offorums like Probiv. We started to realize this when we read a report published in 2019 by the Canadiannonprofit organization eQualitie.14The report describes various phishing and web attacks that have been launched against human rightsactivists and journalists in Uzbekistan since 2016. It also shows attacks against the websites of mediaoutlets between 2016 and 2017. The phishing campaigns were done over nearly a year, from March 2018to February 2019. The report mentions that a threat actor was using professional vulnerability scanningtools such as Acunetix, NetSparker, and WPScan against three websites that cover political news inUzbekistan. EQualitie also reported that it suspects that the same threat actor sent 14 phishing emails totargets who are either journalists or human right activists in Uzbekistan. In 2020, Amnesty Internationalpublished a follow-up report that linked the campaigns that eQualitie originally reported to both Windowsand Android malware.15 Moreover, Amnesty International was able to find an additional 170 targetedaccounts in Uzbekistan and neighboring countries.Amnesty International and eQualitie clearly indicate that the attacks in Uzbekistan had a serious impacton the lives of some individuals. This is a telling example of a cybermercenary providing services for apossibly larger campaign that is causing significant harm to human lives.While both reports do not attribute the attacks to a particular threat actor, we attribute the attacks with amedium confidence level to Void Balaur based on the following:• An overlap in infrastructure between Void Balaur and the indicators that were posted by eQualitie andAmnesty International.17 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s Activities• The hostnames that were used in known Void Balaur cases we are tracking and the attacks describedby eQualitie have a form that is virtually unique in an enormous database of multibillion records ofpassive DNS data spanning 10 years.• Some of the Uzbek targets we found to have been targeted by Void Balaur in 2020 are the same asthe targets described in the eQualitie and Amnesty reports.• The editor in chief of a media website that was attacked in 2016 and 2017 according to the eQualitiereport was targeted by Void Balaur in 2020 through his private email address.• We found one of the email addresses that was mentioned in the eQualitie report as a sender ofcredential phishing emails was back on the group’s target list.Appendix B provides a more detailed explanation on why we think Void Balaur was behind the campaignsas described in the eQualitie report and the Amnesty International report.We do not know who paid Void Balaur to target Uzbek-related media and civil rights activists. Apparently,the client was able to buy Void Balaur’s services even before the group started actively advertising inunderground forums. The campaigns against Uzbek targets started as early as 2016 and were still ongoingas of 2020, according to our data (and probably even extended to 2021). This shows that Void Balaur isbeing hired for long-term campaigns, something we have seen for other targets as well.TargetUzbek journalist platformFirst attackLast attackNov 3, 2020Nov 11, 2020Sender email address mentioned in the Deflect reportNov 5, 2020Dec 23, 2020Individual who signed a political petition in UzbekistanNov 5, 2020Nov 9, 2020Editor-in-chief of a media organization focused on UzbekistanNov 5, 2020Nov 7, 2020Uzbek human rights activistUzbek political partyNov 7, 2020Nov 9, 2020Nov 5, 2020Nov 5, 2020Table 7. Uzbek media and human rights activists that Void Balaur targeted in 2020. The indicatedtimeframes are conservative; these attacks likely occurred over longer periods.While Void Balaur advertises in underground forums where criminals gather to do business, its servicesare not only used for typical cybercrime but for political reasons as well. This shows that Void Balaur isknowingly or unknowingly facilitating attacks in which human rights may be violated, a pattern we havealso seen in a couple of other campaigns. A significant part of these campaigns look like the work of anAPT attacker with long-term goals.Some of Void Balaur’s campaigns are quite brazen. For example, we found that in September 2021,the group targeted the private email addresses of a former head of an intelligence agency, five activegovernment ministers (including the minister of defense) and two members of the national parliament ofan Eastern European country.18 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s ActivitiesWe also found presidential candidates for the 2020 Belarus elections on Void Balaur’s target list.TargetCountrySectorDatePresidential candidatePresidential candidateBelarusBelarusMember of the opposition partyBelarusPoliticsPoliticsPoliticsSep 2020Sep 2020Sep 2020Table 8. Void Balaur targeted high-profile Belarusian political personalities in 2020Aside from political targets in Uzbekistan and Belarus, Void Balaur also targeted politicians and governmentofficials in the Ukraine, Slovakia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Norway, France, and Italy. Some of theseattacks were part of a larger campaign and not necessarily restricted to attacks over the internet alone.Some of the victims felt so threatened that they left their home countries and went into exile.TargetCountrySectorDatePoliticianPoliticianArmeniaUkraineParliamentDec 2020ParliamentOct 2020Spouse of politicianUkraineNov 2020DiplomatMinisterPoliticianRussiaRussiaGovernmentOct 2020GovernmentSep 2021KazakhstanGovernmentJan 2021Table 9.

Void Balaur very likely targeted four politicians in France, Italy, and Norway for the first time on the same day in August 2021. Another French former politician was targeted in September 2021. Thetargets are from different countries, but they shared similar political views.19 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s ActivitiesJournalists and media organizations are also frequent targets of Void Balaur. We have seen the grouptarget more than 25 journalists, although we expect the actual number of targeted journalists to be higher.Some phishing attacks by Void Balaur that, at first glance, look to have a financial motive may actuallybe associated with large-scale disruptive attacks. For example, the group launched attacks against acryptocurrency exchange for years, targeting not only their customers, but executives as well throughtheir corporate and personal email addresses. The website of the company has been a regular victimof DDoS and hacking attacks and one of their employees was even kidnapped for ransom in the past.16While we do not know whether Void Balaur had anything to do with the kidnapping and the DDoS attacks,this is again an example where a Void Balaur victim also suffered from larger-scale attacks with real-lifeconsequences.Several of the group’s targets are from Russia and other neighboring countries, But the group is alsoactive in other countries, including the US, Israel, Japan and European countries.Figure 6. Countries in which Void Balaur email targets were located (companies were targeted viacorporate email addresses; individuals were targeted via private email addresses)Some of the threat actor’s campaigns span a long period of time. The timeline in Figure 8 illustrates along, ongoing campaign against the companies of one of the most successful conglomerates in Russia.From at least September 2020 to August 2021, Void Balaur has been targeting board members, directors,executives and family members — all associated with the same commercial conglomerate.20 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s ActivitiesFigure 7. The timeline of a campaign launched against one of the largest conglomerates in Russia. Several board members, executives, directors and even family members of the billionaire owner were targeted over a year. This shows that for corporate espionage-related attacks, the campaigns of VoidBalaur can be persistent and long lasting.21 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s ActivitiesTargets with Access to a Large Amount of Private InformationWhile investigating the campaigns of Void Balaur, we noticed that the threat actor was targetingorganizations and individuals who potentially have access to a large amount of individuals’ sensitive data.Some of these targets align with Void Balaur’s offerings in underground forums, while others are new.We have observed Void Balaur targeting organizations and individuals in the following sectors:• Mobile and core telco companies• Cellular equipment vendors• Radio and satellite communication companies• ATM machine vendors• Point-of-sale (POS) system vendors• Fintech companies and banks• Business aviation companies• Medical insurance organizations in at least three regions of Russia•In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) clinics in Russia• Biotechnology companies that offer genetic testing servicesThe campaigns are often conducted over an extended period. We do not know exactly why theseorganizations and individuals are being targeted. The size and lucrativeness of the industry may play arole — take for example the IVF market, which has grown into a multibillion industry and could be a reasonfor Void Balaur’s interest in IVF clinics (likely for corporate espionage). Besides targeting IVF doctors, VoidBalaur is also taking aim at academic researchers who study human and animal reproduction, whichcould also support corporate espionage motives.However, we also suspect that Void Balaur is hungry for data and information on individuals and couldbe looking to expand their current business offerings and explore new methods of providing services tocustomers. Offering individuals’ medical data is one example of this. Between May 23, 2020 and April 1,22 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s Activities2021, Void Balaur targeted more than 50 employees of over 20 Russian IVF clinics. Furthermore, the groupmost likely targeted employees of at least four other companies that offer genetic testing services. Thethreat actor also showed an interest in compulsory health insurance companies in at least three republicsof Russia. Finally, the group also targeted medical test labs, general physicians, and companies thatsell medical equipment. Doctors and medical service providers possess a sizeable amount of sensitiveinformation on their patients and there is likely a demand for this kind of data. Offering medical data wouldbe a natural addition to the services that Void Balaur is advertising today.We already mentioned that Void Balaur offers sensitive telco data of individuals in some CIS countries,including text messages and cell tower log files. We also discussed possible ways Void Balaur couldhave retrieved this kind of data, such as compromising either a telco company or some of their keyemployees. For this, we have supporting evidence (shown in Table 6): the threat actor has targeted keyengineers and managers working for mobile telco operators in Russia and Kazakhstan. The group hasalso targeted two manufacturers of cellular equipment as well as companies that specialize in mobilesatellite communications and radio navigation (multiple times for the former).In May and June 2021, Void Balaur added four Russian vendors of ATM and POS (Point of Sale) vendorsand two Russian virtual cash register service providers to their target list. A couple of Russian fintechcompanies that offer innovative products were targeted as well. In our paper on the risks of open banking,we warned that new fintech startups would be interesting targets for cybercriminals, because they haveplenty of information on the finances of individuals and sales data from shops and malls.17In Table 5, we mentioned that Void Balaur offers data on purchased plane tickets, except for chartersand private planes. We also observed that the group has been targeting executives of various businessaviation companies. The reason why these executives were targeted could have been to fill the gap ofVoid Balaur’s offerings on passenger details of charter flights and private planes.23 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s ActivitiesCryptocurrency Account PhishingVoid Balaur has been consistently trying to get access to wallets of various cryptocurrency exchangeservices. For this activity, Void Balaur narrowly targets people who are interested in cryptocurrencies.Stealing cryptocurrency is profitable and interesting to cybercriminals as the virtual money that isassociated with cryptocurrency can be transferred to wallets controlled by the criminals, where there islittle chance of recovering the stolen goods.Since at least 2018, Void Balaur has set up numerous phishing sites related to various cryptocurrencyexchange and cryptocurrency wallet sites. There is one service that stands out, however: EXMO. Someof Void Balaur’s phishing sites for EXMO user, like exmo[.]ms, were used for about three years, which isa rather lengthy time. Besides this domain, Void Balaur set up several other domains for EXMO phishing.Figure 8.

Phishing domain names of Void Balaur, targeting various cryptocurrency platforms25 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s ActivitiesWorking Times of Void BalaurWe were curious about the working habits of Void Balaur. We collected enough data to gain an idea ofthe actor’s working hours. We plotted statistics on hours, weekdays, and months when Void Balaur wasactive (Figures 9-13). We did this for both attacks on email addresses of Russian service providers andattacks on the email addresses of a major international email provider.It appears that Void Balaur usually starts the working day around 6 a.m. GMT and works until around7 p.m. We saw hardly any activity from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. GMT. While Void Balaur is less active duringweekends, the actor often works seven days a week and does not take long vacations such as duringChristmas or in the summer. This is in contrast with an actor like Pawn Storm (APT28) who works duringChristmas holidays, but often takes a break in the summer and during a period from the end of Decemberuntil around mid-January.10%9%7%7%8%8%8%8%8%7%5%2%5%4%4%7%3%0%0%4567891011121314151617181920Time (GMT)Figure 9.

Comparing credential phishing attacks by Pawn Storm from 2014 to 2016 and Void Balaurfrom 2020 to 2021. Since 2020, Pawn Storm has been using brute force attacks on a wider scale.In total, we have observed a dozen email addresses that were targeted by both Pawn Storm during theperiod of 2014 to 2015, and by Void Balaur from 2020 to 2021. Besides the religious leaders, we also sawattacks on diplomats, politicians and a journalist from both Pawn Storm and Void Balaur.Generally, there is a clear overlap in the sectors that are being targeted by both groups as we haveillustrated in the table above. However, there are clear differences as well: Based on our observations,Void Balaur has targeted sectors that Pawn Storm is not active in. For example, Void Balaur has had longrunning campaigns against cryptowallet users and even some cryptoexchange platforms. In our researchon Pawn Storm, we never saw any significant targeting of cryptocurrency platforms.SectorReligious leadersDiplomats (Ukraine)JournalistsOtherPawn Storm 2014Void Balaur 2020to 20165ManyManyN/Ato 202112SeveralManyN/AExact overlap5312Table 13. Overlap in targets for Pawn Storm and Void BalaurAs we reported in 2020, Pawn Storm is still using the classic technique of sending credential phishingemails to gain access to mailboxes.20 It also does large scale brute force attacks and password sprayattacks via Tor, VPN networks, and occasionally, dedicated IP addresses. We don’t know if Void Balaur isalso trying to use brute force attacks on email account credentials.32 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s ActivitiesOutlook for the Cybermercenary IndustryThe reality is that regular internet users cannot easily deter a determined cybermercenary. More thanonce, media outlets have reported on advanced offensive tools in a cybermercenary’s arsenal being usedagainst journalists and human rights activists. Some of these tools include so-called zero-click zero-dayexploits, which do not require any user interaction to infect the target with malware.21 While these toolsmight be meant to be used in the fight against terrorism and organized crime, the reality is that they —knowingly or unknowingly — end up in the hands of threat actors who use it against unwitting targets.The core issue that causes these recurring problems is that some countries may view cybermercenarieswithin their borders as strategic assets that can be used in multiple ways. First, the services and toolsof cybermercenaries can be used in offensive attacks against terrorism and organized crime, and fortargeting foreign assets. Second, they can also be sold to other countries and used as an economic orpolitical tool in foreign policy. Though this might benefit some countries, it also poses a tremendous riskof possible backlash when malicious elements use these tools. Even worse, tools that have been soldoverseas might end up being used against citizens of the country that originally exported these tools.Citizens can pressure national lawmakers into implementing better regulations for the development andexport of cyberweapons for its national industry of cybermercenaries. This is not an easy task, but it’slikely one of the few solutions that can better protect the public against cybermercenary attacks at thegovernment level. Cybermercenaries could also be made accountable for both their actions and thecyberweapons they export, as was advocated in a Microsoft blog post in 2020.2233 | Void Balaur: Tracking a Cybermercenary’s ActivitiesDefending Against NSO Israeli spyware.” Accessed on Oct. 14, 2021, at url human-rights-defenders-targeted-using-malicious-nso-israeli-spyware/.2Jack Stubbs and Christopher Bing.
