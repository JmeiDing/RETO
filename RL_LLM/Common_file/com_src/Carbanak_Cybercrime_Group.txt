Carbanak Group Targets Executives of Financial Organizations in the Middle EastMarch 14, 2016 Authors: Aleksey F, Darien Huss, Chris Wakelin, Chris I, and Proofpoint StaffThe Carbanak group is infamous for infiltrating various financial institutions, and stealing millions of dollars by learning and abusing the internals of victim payment processing networks, ATM networks and transaction systems. Recently, we detected Carbanak campaigns attempting to:• Target high level executives in financial companies or in financial/decision-making roles in the Middle East, U.S. and Europe• Spear-phishing emails delivering URLs, macro documents, exploit documents• Use of Spy.Sekur (Carbanak malware) and commodity remote access Trojans (RATs) such as jRAT, Netwire, Cybergate and othersused in support of operations.1.1 Campaign Targeting Middle East (URLs leading to Exploit Docs)On March 1st 2016, Proofpoint detected a targeted email sent to hand-picked individuals working for banks, financial organizations, and several professional service companies and companies selling enterprise software. These targets are high level executives and decision makers such as directors, senior managers, regional/country managers, operations managers. The majority of targets work in the Middle East region in countries such as UAE, Lebanon, Kuwait, Yemen and others.Figure 1: Email sent to executives working in the Middle EastThe email contained a URL to a Microsoft Word document hosted on a compromised site churchmanarts[.]com. The document, CVE-2015-2545 when opened to drop and execute a downloader from the client’s temporary folder. This document drops essentially the same payload every time, but slightly modified, possibly so that every execution results in a dropped file with a different hash.Figure 2: CVE-2015-2545 document dropping the malware downloader2Malware: Downloader and Sky.SekurAfter exploiting the vulnerability, the document drops the payload into %TMP%\1B9D.tmp (SHA256: packed executable (PE) that utilizes the Microsoft JScript library to retrieve the hardcoded HTTP location (Figure 4) and then executes the downloaded payload using WScript.Shell. In this case it retrieved the second-stage payload Spy.Sekur from hxxp://78.128.92[.]49/ retrieving payloadFigure 4: Decompiled MSIL showing hardcoded payload HTTP targetBlesx.exe is a NSIS self-extracting installer. It is signed with a SHA1 digest Time Doctor LLC certificate, serial number 56:0E:89:8E:A6: CE:12:B2:62:57:40:32:80:76:DC:FB and a SHA256 digest Tragon Corporation certificate, serial number 00:C3:A9:04:56:84:D2:9E:75. The excerpt from the extracted NSIS script shown in Figure 6 depicts the basic functionality of this Carbanak/Spy.Sekur dropper. The filenames of the payloads contained in the NSIS-installer are shown in lines 215, 216, 217 and 221 from the NSIS script excerpt (described in Table 1).Figure 5: Certificate used to sign the malware3Figure 6: Extracted NSIS script showing dropped payload names and 4c4d1f085a6575d97c3e892b925da82Table 1: Description of Carbanak NSIS-installer payloadscyan bl 4.ADOEncoded Spy.SekurFervencyPoseuseChitchatEncoded WinAPIsstole.dllSystem.dllDecodes and executes Spy.SekurNSIS System Plug-in, used to execute stole.dllThe basic functionality of the NSIS installer begins first with System.dll, which is used to execute stole.dll with the provided parameters on line 220. Additional WinAPIs needed by stole.dll are decoded from the file FervencyPoseuseChitchat (Table 1). Next, the file “cyan bl 4.ADO” is decoded using the key GurnardScapularyHydrograph provided by the NSIS script, resulting in a Carbanak/Spy.Sekur identical to Malwarebytes research3, however the prev_j value is instead initialized to “key[0] % keylen”.Figure 7: Spy.Sekur HTTP GET command-and-control (C&C) beaconFigure 8: Spy.Sekur TCP C&C beacon4Malware: Java-based RAT, jRATAt the same time they were spreading Spy.Sekur, the attackers also sent emails (with some target overlap) containing URLs linking to jRAT. The email contained a URL to a Java JAR file hosted on a compromised site damianroz[.] com. The malware file, captioned_transactionutrno_fftt16044002829-dtd02032016imagejpg.jar (SHA256: decompiled jRAT codeThis RAT gives the attacker the functionality to chat with the victim, manage files (copy, create, delete, download, get dride listing, move, rename, run), keylogger, manage processes (kill, create), monitor clipboard, monitor webcam by taking images and capture, record sound, reboot, shutdown, logoff, modify registry (read, delete, write keys), read hosts file, get the victim’s geographic location, and other capabilities.The following evidence enabled us to connect this RAT to same group distributing Spy.Sekur:• Similarity in payload URLs. For example, the malicious URL in the email leading to Spy.Sekur is shown first and the malicious URLleading to jRAT is shown below it: hxxp://churchmanarts[.]com/googlesqlz/22t/download.php?file=[base64 string] hxxp://damianroz[.]com/22t/download.php?file=[base64 string]• Overlap in sender email addresses• The jRAT C&C IP address, 185.29.9[.]16 was observed as the first one to download the malicious document from churchmanarts[.]com. We believe that 185.29.9[.]16 was under the control of the attacker and used as a proxy and C&C address.1.2. Campaign Targeting U.S. and Europe (Macro Document Attachments)On March 4th 2016, Proofpoint detected more targeted emails sent to individuals (as well as support and operational aliases) working for financial industry, mass media, and other seemingly unrelated targets in fire, safety, air conditioning and heating. These individuals all worked in financial and helpdesk roles such as account manager, credit controller, and IT support. Unlike the previously described campaign, majority of targets work in U.S.- and Europe-based companies.5Figure 10: Example email sent in March 4th campaign with subject “Balance Confirmation as on March 05 2016”Unlike the March 1st campaign, which contained links to exploit documents, this campaign employed documents attached to email messages. The two observed documents “remitter request_2016-03-05-122839.doc” and “Reverse debit posted in Error 040316.doc” use macros to download the final Spy.Sekur payload from hxxp://154.16.138[.]74/sexit.exe.Figure 11: Attachment “remitter request_2016-03-05-122839.doc”Figure 12: Attachment “Reverse debit posted in Error 040316.doc”6Malware: Spy.SekurOnce the user enables the malicious macros embedded in the document attachment, each document downloads Spy.Sekur payload the March 1st campaign, there is no separate downloader. As before, however, the payload is a NSIS-self extracting installer signed with the same Time Doctor LLC and Tragon Corporation certificates.Once installed and running, Spy.Sekur beacons to the same C&C server www[.]carenty44[.]net and IP address 78.128.92[.]29. Similarly, in the custom TCP C&C beacon, the string “ArabLab0” can be observed; this is a hardcoded value possibly used as the campaign identifier for these attacks.Malware: NetwireWhile we did not observe any emails attempting to infect targets with Netwire in this campaign, we discovered it hosted on hxxp://154.16.138[.]74/vex.exe (SHA256: Spy.Sekur. We believe the Netwire may have been spread as a part of the same campaign.The following evidence enabled us to connect this Netwire malware to the same group distributing Spy.Sekur:• The payload IP address that hosted Spy.Sekur and Netwire at the same time• hxxp://154.16.138[.]74/vex.exe (Netwire)• hxxp://154.16.138[.]74/sexit.exe (Spy.Sekur)Figure 13: Extracted Netwire configuration• The Netwire C&C IP address, 185.29.9[.]16, is once again the same IP that was used as C&C for the previously described jRAT andobserved downloading the malicious document from churchmanarts[.]com.Figure 14: Maltego graph illustrating Spy.Sekur connections to other RATs71.3 Regional Targeting StatisticsAnalyzing a combination of logs (specifically, IP addresses downloading malicious documents, with our best effort to filter out security researchers) and statistics on recipients of the malicious emails, we created a chart showing the targeted countries (Figure 15). Targets in the U.S. heavily outweigh other countries due to the preponderance of financial organizations based. Organizations in Middle Eastern countries such as Oman, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and others were the next most-targeted.Figure 15: Campaign targeting by country2. Additional Carbanak Campaigns and PayloadsWhile searching for additional occurrences of the MSIL/JScript downloader, we uncovered an additional payload URL that was rotated several times producing different payloads. As shown in the Maltego graph in Figure 14, several MSIL/JScript downloaders were pointed at the URL: hxxp://172.98.202[.]171/famzy/final.exe. MorphineRAT, DarkComet, and most notably Spy.Sekur have been observed being hosted at the URL (Table 2).8SHA256Payload familyC&C86c20c0e0417e73b51241a769164ddb contained the hardcoded identifier “TUBOR0”. We have observed additional samples using the same identifier, the same Time Doctor LLC certificate previously mentioned as well as a SHA256 digest MicroHealth certificate, serial number 00:8F:3A:01:E1:C3:EE:AF:CC:BB:E6:22:95:50:7A:4E:20. An additional “TUBOR0” sample (SHA256: was not signed; however, it was configured to use the same C&C (www[.]googlesswe[.]com and 149.202.29[.]77) as the MicroHealth signed Spy.Sekur. Furthermore, an “ArabLab0” sample was found hosted at hxxp://87[.]120[.]37[.]90/fend.png configured with the same C&C as other “ArabLab0” samples, however neither a downloader or an email campaign has been discovered utilizing the fend. png URL. The overlaps in the Spy.Sekur campaigns as well as the DarkComet and MorphineRAT activity are illustrated in the Maltego graph in Figure 16.Figure 16: Maltego graph of TUBOR0. ArabLab0 Spy.Sekur overlap and additional RATs92.2. MorphineRAT / DarkComet ConnectionsFinally, we researchers observed an email campaign utilizing a CVE-2015-2545 attachment (SHA256:a400ef9313199f5795de45cbe6e While the targeting for this campaign is not consistent with previous email campaigns that we have attributed to Carbanak, definite similarities and overlap exist, including:• CVE-2015-2545 exploit attachments with same metadata• Exploit attachments delivering MSIL/JScript Downloader• MSIL/JScript Downloader targets in both instances at some point were Spy.SekurAlthough none has been proven definitively at this time, we have several possible explanations for a connection between the DarkComet/MorphineRAT and Carbanak actors:• DarkComet/MorphineRAT and Carbanak actor(s) are employing the same payload delivery service.• DarkComet/MorphineRAT and Carbanak actor(s) work closely together to achieve their goals (partnership, hired help, etc.).• DarkComet/MorphineRAT activity is conducted by Carbanak actor(s) however the responsible operators are potentially functioningwith different goals in mind as illustrated by the wide range of targeted vertical industries.2.3. Usage of Signed PayloadsAs discussed above, numerous Spy.Sekur payloads have been signed using stolen or fraudulent certificates. In addition to Spy.Sekur, these certificates have been used to sign many other samples belonging to different families, including various crypto ransomware variants (Locky, TeslaCrypt, CryptoWall, Raas, Critroni), Neurevt, and Luminosity Link RAT. It is possible that the Carbanak actor(s) are using signing certificates that are also made available to other groups and actors, therefore observing these certificates is not a strong enough indicator for Carbanak activity.2.4. An Even Older Campaign Delivering Toshliph & CyberGateWhile this RAT was involved in a much older campaign than described in this document, we have previously observed Toshliph (another malware in Carbanak arsenal) downloading Cybergate as a secondary payload. We include this information here for completeness. On August 26, 2015, a document “Application form USD duplicate payment.doc” (SHA256: working at U.S.-based financial organizations. It exploited CVE-2015-1770 and CVE-2015-1641 to drop Toshliph (SHA256: CyberGate (C2: 93.115.38[.]202). It should be noted that the C&C for this old Aug 2015 Toshliph campaign is in the same netblock as the March 2016 Spy.Sekur campaigns.ConclusionThe Carbanak group has been behind a number of attacks since 2013, most characterized by APT-style campaigns targeting multiple groups with a variety of malware. In this case, we saw the group use new exploits, macro documents, and RATs to target new groups outside their usual Russian domains. The group used attachment campaigns, URLs linking to exploit documents, and sophisticated malware to go after targets in the US and Middle East. The group also expanded its targeting from financial institutions to seemingly unrelated targets in fire, safety, and HVAC. However, as we learned from the Target data breach, among others, vendors and suppliers can give attackers a point of entry into their real target.References[1] url [2] url [3] url 3: Indicators of CompromiseIOCIOC TypeDescriptionhxxp://churchmanarts[.]com/googlesqlz/22t/download.php?file= MTMxNzgyMjcyM19fX193cm9uZ19hbW91bi0wMTAzMjAxNi5kb2M=Spy.SekurEncoded Spy.Sekurhxxp://damianroz[.]com/22t/download.php?file=NjA0Mjgx 49d260d18496ecb3d3b90caca0612URLURLURLURLURLSHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256MSIL/Jscript downloader payload“remitter request_2016-03-05-122839.doc” payload Netwire hosted on siteSpy.Sekur, MorphineRAT, and DarkComet hosted on site Spy.Sekur hosted on siteWRONG_AMOUN-01032016.doc exploits CVE-2015-2545“remitter request_2016-03-05-122839. doc”, Macro document sent as attachment, downloads Spy.Sekur “application form usd duplicate payment.doc”, document dropping Toshliph“reverse debit posted in error 040316.doc”MSIL/JScript Downloader dropped by WRONG_AMOUN-01032016.doc“proforma invoice.doc.docx”“MSIL/JScript Downloader dropped by “proforma invoice.doc.docx”PPT likely exploiting CVE-2014-6352 to deliver Spy.SekurSpy.Sekur downloaded by MSIL/JScript downloader from hxxp://78.128.92[.]49/ blesx.exe Sky.Sekur hosted on hxxp://154.16.138[.]74/sexit.exejRAT hosted on hxxp://damianroz[.] com/22t/download.php?file=NjA0MjgxM 041f28004ee667a5683a53532206cSHA256Netwire hosted on 6ed719ef3cbc10e7b4d19172e185.29.9[.]1678.128.92[.]2978.128.92[.]11778.128.92[.]49SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256SHA256IPIPIPIPToshliph that downloads CyberGateCybergate downloaded by ToshliphSpy.Sekur - “TUBOR0”Spy.Sekur dropped by PPT - “TUBOR0”Spy.Sekur hosted as /famzy/final.exe - “TUBOR0”MorphineRAT hosted as /famzy/final.exeMorphineRAT hosted as /famzy/final.exeDarkComet hosted as /famzy/final.exeDarkComet hosted as /famzy/final.exeDarkComet hosted as /famzy/final.exeDarkComet hosted as /famzy/final.exeSpy.Sekur hosted as fend.pngDropper likely exploiting CVE-2015-1701 to deliver MSIL/JScript DownloaderMSIL/JScript Downloader dropped by CVE- 2015-1701 dropper - /famzy/final.exeMSIL/JScript Downloader - /famzy/final.exeSpy.Sekur - “TUBOR0”jRAT C2Spy.Sekur C2Toshliph C2 (that downloads Cybergate)Hosted blesx.exe payloadThreat Insight | Carbanak Group Targets Executives of Financial Organizations in the Middle East12IOCIOC TypeDescription93.115.38[.]202149.202.29[.]77216.170.118[.]136149.202.29[.]114172.98.202[.]171154.16.138[.]7487.120.37[.]90godwin231.zapto[.]orgwww.craptioerne[.]comwww.googlesswe[.]comwww.carenty44[.]netwww.fenticpayrt[.]comIPIPIPIPIPIPIPDomainDomainDomainDomainDomainCyberGate C2Spy.Sekur C2Spy.Sekur C2Spy.Sekur C2Hosted /famzy/final.exe payloadsHosted sexit.exe payloadHosted fend.png payloadMorphineRAT and DarkComet C2Spy.Sekur C&C, possible diversionSpy.Sekur C&C, possible diversionSpy.Sekur C&C, possible diversionSpy.Sekur C&C, possible diversionMicroHealth (sha256) 00:8F:3A:01:E1:C3:EE:AF:CC:BB:E6:22:95:5 0:7A:4E:20Time Doctor LLC (sha1) 56:0E:89:8E:A6:CE:12:B2:62:57:40:32:80: 76:DC:FBSigning certificateCertificate used to sign Spy.SekurSigning certificateCertificate used to sign Spy.SekurTragon Corporation (sha256) 00:C3:A9:04:56:84:D2:9E:75Signing certificateCertificate used to sign Spy.Sekurabout proofpoint Proofpoint Inc.
