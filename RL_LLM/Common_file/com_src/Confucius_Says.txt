In order to increase the likelihood of their malware successfully communicating home, cyber espionage threat actors are increasingly abusing legitimate web services, in lieu of DNS lookups to retrieve a command and control address. This negates the requirement to make DNS requests for domains that may be considered malicious and are therefore blocked. For attackers, that’s an advantage because it allows their initial communications channel to be obscured amongst other trafﬁc to legitimate services.This blog post examines two similar malware families that utilize the aforementioned technique to abuse legitimate websites, their connections to each other, and their connections to known espionage campaigns. The ﬁrst of which we call ‘CONFUCIUS_A’, a malware family that has links to a series of attacks associated with a backdoor attack method commonly known as SNEEPY (aka ByeByeShell) ﬁrst reported by Rapid7 in 2013. The second of which we call ‘CONFUCIUS_B’, which has a loose link to the series of attacks associated with Operation Patchwork and The Hangover Report. Confucius says… resolve your command and control domains using web services. In 2013, Rapid7 reported on a series of relatively amateur attacks against Pakistani targets. For a long time after the report was published, little changed in how the attackers operated. Although many of the attacks we see today from the group remain the same, we began observing a new backdoor, CONFUCIUS_A, being dropped by the attackers starting in early 2014. Speciﬁcally, the command and control addresses used across multiple SNEEPY samples were being used by CONFUCIUS_A samples. In the case of just one or two samples, without temporal overlap, this may not be deemed a strong link to CONFUCIUS_A, however it occurs across a great deal of the infrastructure we have observed.In most cases where we have been able to identify the droppers, the attack begins with an executable ﬁle being sent directly to targets via e-mail. Occasionally the attackers leverage builders for known document exploits, but most of the time they still use self- extracting binaries. The themes of the phishing e-mails vary according to the target, but invariably the ﬁle is compiled with an icon that matches the expected content. Examples of the themes used in attacks using CONFUCIUS_A and the surrounding cluster of activity include:url Says Malware Families Get Further By Abusing Legitimate WebsitesInvitations to events relevant to the recipients Pornographic material Fake updates to popular software products News content Political contentWe have limited evidence of who the targets are, but they appear to primarily be based in the Middle East and parts of Asia, with a focus on Pakistan. In addition to those targets, there are occasional targets seen at enterprises across the globe.Early samples of the CONFUCIUS_A malware did not use any legitimate web services for DNS resolution; however, more recent samples of the CONFUCIUS_A malware use a range of legitimate web services to resolve command and control addresses, the highest proﬁle of which are Yahoo and Quora. The malware was given its name based on the content of one of the ﬁrst pages we saw being retrieved to determine a command and control address, which is written in the style of a ‘Confucius says’ joke. See Figure 1.Figure 1 – An example of Quora page contacted by the malware.Sometimes malware communicates with legitimate web services simply to perform a connectivity check, but in this case the page was too speciﬁc to suggest that was what the attackers were doing. So we decided to investigate how the malware processed the resulting content. If this is the question, what is the answer? For the purposes of illustrating how the command and control address is decoded we will look at the sample with SHA256: sample of the malware requests the page shown below in order to determine what IP to POST to.url Says Malware Families Get Further By Abusing Legitimate WebsitesFigure 2 – The Quora page contacted by the malware to retrieve its command and control address.Reading through the answer, it all makes sense until the section highlighted is reached. By looking at the underlying code, we found that CONFUCIUS_A is looking for keywords between the phrases “suggested options are” and “hope it will help” and decoding the interim phrase. The decoding is done using a simple lookup table, as shown in Figure 3.Figure 3 – A memory dump from a CONFUCIUS_A sample showing the lookup table used by the malware, the table is truncated for presentation purposes.url Says Malware Families Get Further By Abusing Legitimate WebsitesThe lookup table begins with the marker for the beginning and end of the useful content, and then contains 255 words, each of which corresponds to a number (for example prudent == 255). Using this lookup table in memory it can then derive the command and control address from the text between the markers, “ﬁll plate clever road” becomes 91.210.107[.]104.Figure 4 – HTTP POST request made to command and control server Additional malware contacting Yahoo and Quora During our investigation into the CONFUCIUS_A malware, one of the ways we tried to identify variations of the backdoor was by looking for samples that communicated with the same legitimate services as known CONFUCIUS_A samples. In doing so, we encountered another set of samples exhibiting very similar behavior, which we refer to as CONFUCIUS_B, due to their similarity, and their likely similar origins. Unfortunately, we have fewer details about how CONFUCIUS_B malware is delivered or the targets it intends to hit.For the purposes of this write-up we will follow the chain of dropped ﬁles from the dropper with SHA256: At ﬁrst glance CONFUCIUS_B looks very similar to CONFUCIUS_A, and they are also packaged in plain SFX binary ﬁles. The CONFUCIUS_B executable is disguised as a PowerPoint presentation, using a Right-To-Left-Override (RTLO) trick and a false icon. When executed, the self-extracting RAR package drops four ﬁles to the %AppData% folder, as shown in Figure 5.Figure 5 – The ﬁles dropped by CONFUCIUS_BFancy.vbs executes fancy.bat, which in turn opens the presentation and runs the second stage executable svchost.exe. As with CONFUCIUS_A, the initial beacons from this svchost.exe are also to Yahoo and Quora, but the pages contacted, whilst odd did not contain any obvious markers, rather they appeared to be entirely gibberish:url Says Malware Families Get Further By Abusing Legitimate WebsitesFigure 6 – An exemplary Quora page contacted by the malware.So far, the execution chain, involving an SFX RAR and multiple scripts is similar to some samples of SNEEPY, which we associate with CONFUCIUS_A, but this is where the similarities between CONFUCIUS_A and CONFUCIUS_B begin to diverge. Svchost.exe has a custom obfuscation scheme not seen in CONFUCIUS_A. This obfuscation allows us to quickly identify all of the CONFUCIUS_B variants; their hashes are included at the end of this post. The obfuscation routine is given in Figure 7.url Says Malware Families Get Further By Abusing Legitimate WebsitesFigure 7 – The obfuscation routine shared across all CONFUCIUS_B samples.url Says Malware Families Get Further By Abusing Legitimate WebsitesUnderneath that custom obfuscation lies a UPX packed executable which contains the Yahoo and Quora functionality that originally piqued our interest. After unpacking the UPX code, we began reverse engineering the resulting binary to see how CONFUCIUS_B interacted with the Yahoo and Quora pages it initially requested. We discovered that CONFUCIUS_B pieces together its DNS resolution from keywords in the Yahoo and Quora posts similar to that of CONFUCIUS_A.CONFUCIUS_B takes certain keywords in the Quora and Yahoo pages and applies them to a lookup table in memory. Using that lookup table an IP address to POST to is derived. The way this is done can be seen in a memory dump from the running process when it contacts a relevant address, for example as shown in Figure 8.Figure 8 – A memory dump of a CONFUCIUS_B illustrating the lookup table and initial beacon address.The lookup table takes key words and assigns them numbers, or a ‘.’ character, in order to build an IP address, and is arranged as shown in Table 1.love 7url Says Malware Families Get Further By Abusing Legitimate Websitesnatural .Table 1 – Lookup table used by the malware to determine it’s command and control address.By applying the lookup table to the Quora page shown in Figure 6, we can derive the IP the malware will POST to next for further communications.Using our lookup table, giving us an address of 149.202.110[.]2:This method of substituting words for components of an IP address, and the repeat use of Yahoo and Quora are novel, which suggest it is likely that the same malware author, or group of malware authors, authored both backdoors. Link to Patchwork and test samples The domain “com-account-jfnjkr[.]xyz” is linked to the CONFUCIUS_B attacks as it was a C2 for the sample downloads CONFUCIUS_B. On May 24, 2016, the same domain hosted the sample ﬁle stealer malware associated with the Patchwork attackers, via a shared mutex: Pivoting through samples in Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus, we were able to ﬁnd what appears to be an early test sample of the malware that creates the same mutex; the SHA256 of the sample is believe it is a test sample, as the conﬁgured command and control domain for this sample is ‘breachframework[.]com’. This can also be linked back to known CONFUCIUS_B sample via a shared SSL certiﬁcate. Breachframework[.]com previously 104.23.35[.]15, a known command and control address for CONFUCIUS_B. These relationships are summarized in Figure 9.Figure 9 – An overview of the link to the test infrastructure. Conclusion In this blog post, we discussed two separate malware variations that behave in very similar ways and use similar techniques to acquire a C2 address, with both using Yahoo Answers and Quora to evade traditional mechanisms for blocking command and control domains. Although we cannot link the two clusters of activity by their infrastructure, the technique used to resolve domains is unusual. We also believe that both clusters of activity have links to attacks with likely Indian origins, the CONFUCIUS_A attacks are linked to the use of SNEEPY/BYEBYESHELL and the CONFUCIUS_B have a loose link to Hangover. The two malware families themselves are also very similar, and therefore we think that the shared technique is an indication of a single developer, or development company, behind both CONFUCIUS_A and CONFUCIUS_B. It is likely that the two clusters of activity are operated by two different operators; however, as the command and control infrastructure used by each cluster differs in the choices of hosting providers.Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus customers can further explore these malware families and related campaigns with the tags:Confucious_A SneepyAll samples discussed in the blog and those in the appendix are detected as malicious (early)url Says Malware Families Get Further By Abusing Legitimate Websites2f3005a06cf6819690da987414e7d‐ me-you-like-or-couple-weed-or-hate-weed-with-deedy-love-claggy-1 url hxxps://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20160229024628AA4XQ7r hxxp://www.nefuri.com/hi_is_bingle_hate_and_love_the_green_or_it_ﬁre_couple_ﬁre_tell _me_you_like_or_couple_weed_or_hate_weed_with_deedy_block_claggy_1562153.html hxxp://www.answerlib.org/qv/20160229115557AAXc2Ib.html hxxps://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20160229115557AAXc2Ib hxxps://www.question.com/what-are-the-precautions-for-diphtheria-tetanus-998506.html hxxp://ﬁndnerd.com/list/view/How-to-make-a-simple-settings-page-in-android/15891/ hxxp://able2know.org/topic/312620-1 hxxp://bs71.blog.com/2016/03/01/performing-namaz/ hxxp://www.linkibl.com/l/deﬁne-simple-support-boundary-condition-of-a-beam-solid- hxxp://www.education.com/question/working-model-depict-buoyancy/ hxxp://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-ﬁnd-Port-de-Vaire hxxp://www.ﬁxya.com/support/t25556697-intel_desktop_board_dh67cl_having_vga hxxp://www.education.com/question/scientist-calculate-distance-planets hxxp://technology.blurtit.com/4492774/import-mri-ct-and-microct-data hxxp://bs71.blog.com/2016/03/01/performing-namaz/ hxxp://www.linkibl.com/l/deﬁne-simple-support-boundary-condition-of-a-beam-solid- hxxps://www.quora.com/Is-bingle-hate-and-love-the-green-or-it-ﬁre-couple-ﬁre-tell- me-you-like-or-couple-weed-or-hate-weed-with-deedy-love-claggy-1 hxxps://www.quora.com/How-fertilization-takes-place-in-Plants C2 Addresses: adhath-learning[.]com ns1[.]b3autybab3s[.]com mail[.]cooperednews[.]info ns2[.]cooperednews[.]info ns2[.]softwares-free[.]comurl Says Malware Families Get Further By Abusing Legitimate Websiteswww[.]ﬁerybarrels[.]com ns1[.]cooperednews[.]info znaniye-onlayn[.]com www[.]templetom[.]com ns2[.]didlynews[.]info ns1[.]didlynews[.]info purple-banana[.]com uchitel-nitsa[.]com trk[.]greatleonidas[.]com www[.]cutedazzle[.]com www[.]gallopingroses[.]com ns2[.]b3autybab3s[.]com softwares-free[.]com www[.]romanrugby[.]com ns1[.]softwares-free[.]com jobs[.]undp[.]tangyball[.]com news-letters-4u[.]com www[.]tumblebin[.]comurl Says Malware Families Get Further By Abusing Legitimate Websiteslittle-nuts[.]com ftp[.]wond3rfulworld[.]com blog[.]younghogs[.]com ww2[.]younghogs[.]com www[.]younghogs[.]com ww1[.]younghogs[.]com mx2[.]newstodayreviews[.]com mx1[.]newstodayreviews[.]com mx3[.]newstodayreviews[.]com www[.]onepickle[.]com quicktime[.]softwares-free[.]com ns1[.]bidux[.]com[.]avtofrom[.]us www[.]nophoz[.]com com-account-jfnjkr[.]xyz 104[.]219[.]250[.]204 216[.]189[.]148[.]125 149[.]202[.]110[.]2 104[.]219[.]250[.]205 5[.]135[.]85[.]16 78[.]128[.]92[.]101 206[.]221[.]188[.]98 104[.]232[.]35[.]15 5[.]39[.]23[.]192 95[.]211[.]135[.]167 46[.]165[.]207[.]109 95[.]211[.]38[.]134 46[.]165[.]249[.]223 95[.]211[.]135[.]162 46[.]165[.]207[.]140 46[.]165[.]207[.]120 95[.]211[.]107[.]75 94[.]242[.]219[.]203 95[.]211[.]38[.]133 46[.]165[.]207[.]112 95[.]211[.]3[.]135 91[.]210[.]107[.]107 46[.]165[.]207[.]114 91[.]210[.]107[.]108 95[.]211[.]205[.]142 95[.]211[.]107[.]71 46[.]165[.]207[.]116 95[.]211[.]135[.]168 46[.]165[.]207[.]134url Says Malware Families Get Further By Abusing Legitimate Websites46[.]165[.]207[.]98 46[.]165[.]207[.]113 46[.]165[.]207[.]138 94[.]242[.]219[.]199 46[.]165[.]207[.]142 46[.]165[.]207[.]99 95[.]211[.]107[.]72 95[.]211[.]38[.]135 46[.]165[.]207[.]132 46[.]165[.]207[.]108url
