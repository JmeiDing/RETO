THREAT ANALYSISLATEST CYBER ESPIONAGE MALWARE ATTACKS DRAGONFISH DELIVERS NEW FORM OF ELISE MALWARE TARGETING ASEAN DEFENCE MINISTERS’ MEETING AND ASSOCIATESCopyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.THREAT ANALYSISThe well-known threat group called DRAGONFISH or Lotus Blossom are distributing a new form of Elise malware targeting organizations for espionage purposes. The threat actors associated with DRAGONFISH have previously focused their campaigns on targets in Southeast Asia, specifically those located in countries near the South China Sea. These attacks have mainly targeted high-profile government, military and political institutions, but other victims include those operating in the education and telecommunication industries. iDefense analysts have identified a campaign likely to be targeting members of— or those with affiliation or interest in—the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM).This threat analysis provides security operations center (SOC) analysts and engineers with detailed information pertaining to the workings of the Elise malware family and the indicators of compromise (IoCs) to assist them in their own independent analyses. This threat analysis will help to inform organizations and support their decision making on how to better contain or mitigate the threat through monitoring or blocking. They may consider using the information to inform hunting activities for systems that may already have been compromised, or by using the IoCs by adding them to hunting lists or endpoint detection & response (EDR) solutions as well as to network- and host- based backlists to detect and deny malware implantation—and command and control (C2) communication—or whatever mitigations they determine are most appropriate for their environments. Given the inherent nature of threat intelligence, it is based on information gathered and understood at a specific point in time.Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security.

Word document (see • Author: mary • Last Modified by: mary • Created Time Stamp: 2018:01:19 14:56:00 (Jan. 19, 2018, 2:56 p.m.) • Last Modified Time Stamp: 2018:01:19 14:56:00 (JAn. 19, 2018, 2:56 p.m.)Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.3THREAT ANALYSISExhibit 1: Decoy DocumentThe Word document, which includes information on ADMM-Plus members, has a malicious executable file embedded as an OLE object (see Exhibit 2).Exhibit 2: Original Source PathThe embedded file named a.b is dropped to the %temp% folder once the Word document is opened and is executed by exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. The payload is consequently moved to \AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Caches\ as a file named NavShExt.dll and the executable a.b is deleted.This file NavShExt.dll is a PE32 dynamic-link library (DLL), and the filename suggests that the malware author intended to disguise the file as a legitimate Symantec Corp. • Compile Time: 2018-01-12 17:59:58 (Jan. 12, 2018, 5:59 p.m.) • Export Function: SettingCopyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.4THREAT ANALYSISThe malware performs the following set of actions:1. Starts iexplore.exe (Internet Explorer) in a suspended state2. Injects NavShExt.dll into the iexplore.exe process and calls the DLLexport Setting function3. The iexplore.exe process continues to run in the background4. Creates a mutex named donotbotherme (see Exhibit 3) to avoid havingduplicated executions5. Creates a file named thumbcache_1CD60.db inAppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\ where the harvested data is stored6. Sends data to and downloads files and commands from the designated C2server7. Harvests extensive system information from the machine, such as thefollowing: • LAN and WAN IP addresses (for the latter, it uses the free IP addressservice ipaddress.com)Installed software list• Proxy information • • Process enumeration via tasklist • List of all the files on the user’s desktopExhibit 3: Mutex CreationBased on the currently available intelligence we also believe the malware is capable of providing the attacker with a remote shell on the host and can completely uninstall itself.Execution debug messages are stored in the %temp% folder in a file named FXSAPIDebugLogFile.tmp. Example messages include Client Start!, indicating aCopyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.5THREAT ANALYSISsuccessful infection, or an error message such as [2018-1-25 13:35:22] Try All Addr Failed! Sleep For: 10.100000 Minutes!, indicating that the C2 sever cannot be reached and the malware will sleep for a fixed amount of time.Logs are encrypted using the following static AES key: Ss)4:WKsRr(3/VJrQq&2.UIqPp%1-THp.Of particular interest is an embedded, custom application in a .data section that is responsible for loading and executing executables and DLLs from inside the main binary. The application supports the following command-line options:• •runexe 1.exe /c command… rundll 1.dll, DllMainWhen attempting to find more information about this application, iDefense features the same application and was mentioned in a 2015 report titled Operation Lotus Blossom by the Unit42 team at partner organization Palo Alto Networks.Several observations detailed in this report on Elise variant C align with the findings disclosed above:• Similar targeting of Southeast Asia • Same export function name in the dropper DLL: Setting • • Heavy anti-virtual-machine features • Similar obfuscation techniques used to exfiltrate data to C2 server (usingIdentical custom application to load and execute EXEs or DLLsbase64-encoded cookie values)In contrast to the earlier campaigns, debug paths are completely stripped. Persistence is achieved using the Run Registry key with the value name IAStorD:• HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\IAStorDAs mentioned earlier, two hidden DLLs can be discovered that are additionally injected into iexplore.exe and have the export functions named DePatchEntry or EvilEntry. These DLLs provide additional loading and other anti-analysis functionalities.The malware attempts to spoof the host and query non-existing domains, such as the following:• 3qyo4o7.7r7i3[.]info • dtdf5vu.nt7yq[.]info • • 38qmk6.0to9[.]info • ubkv1t.ec0[.]comj.4tc3ldw.g9ml.www0[.]orgCopyright © 2018 Accenture Security.

The real C2 server, 103.236.150[.]14, is actually hardcoded (see Exhibit 4).Exhibit 4: Real C2 Server Hardcoded in the MalwareCopyright © 2018 Accenture Security.
