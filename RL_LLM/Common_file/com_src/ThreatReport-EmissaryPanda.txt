They were exploited by ransomware gangs and hackers for mining crypto currencies. But where have the professional spies, the APT groups been? Did they miss such opportunities and take a vacation from cyber warfare? Surely they didn't. And we have collected evidence. The benefactors of the scatter fire The APT group Emissary Panda (also known as APT27, LuckyMouse) has exploited the Microsoft Exchange vulnerability "ProxyLogon", often publicly referred to as "Hafnium" vulnerability, to carry out targeted industrial espionage. The particularly perfidious aspect of this is that they intentionally acted like "ordinary hackers" in order not to trigger a comprehensive analysis and remediation. With great success. We analyzed several incidents and found that some customers did not seriously follow up on a ProxyLogon compromise because at first glance it looked like an attack by an occasional attacker. This is how Emissary Panda (APT27) managed to run through the classic APT kill chain and steal trade secrets undetected for months. Our report not only provides background and details on the process, the TTPs and the IOCs, but also initial evidence that the OGNL injection in Confluence was and is also being of interest for targeted industrial espionage. The same applies for log4shell. Strategies for Cyber Security 2022 The effects of the global vulnerabilities from 2021 will only gradually come to light. We have to assume that numerous APT and other compromises by ProxyLogon (Exchange), OGNL injection (Confluence) and log4shell (Log4j) are still undetected. Especially for log4shell, the typical detection period of three to six months has not even been reached yet. In addition, global vulnerabilities will again come to light and be exploited in 2022. Anything else would be close to a miracle. Companies are therefore well advised to prepare for this.

Command and Control (C2) traffic and data exfiltration was allegedly observed. After a quick analysis of the firewall logs, the customer was able to verify the suspicion and realize that the traffic had started several months earlier. As a result, the customer decided to investigate further and ask HvS to conduct a situation assessment. In the first step of the investigation, ten internal systems with C2 traffic were identified and compromise scans of them were performed. These scans proofed a clear compromise of these systems and the presence of HyperBro, a Remote Access Tool (RAT), and other typical attack traces. A comprehensive Incident Response (IR) was then initiated with the goal of analyzing the entire infrastructure to determine the level of compromise, identify the entry vector, uncover the actor's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), assess the impact, and finally plan remediation actions.Up to this point, this case was a normal Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) incident with common TTPs. The case became interesting when we correlated the Indicators of Compromise (IOC) of this incident with the IOCs of our previous incidents. This correlation led to unexpected matches between incidents that at first glance appeared to be unrelated, which is described in more detail in section A Spotlight on the Role of APT Groups.One of the first defensive measures was to deploy an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool on all endpoints. This was to increase visibility and provide capabilities for containment and response, which later proved to be crucial. While preparing for remediation, the actor began collecting data again, using the domain administrator privileges it had previously gained. This allowed near real-time countermeasures by the IR team, which are described in detail in Phase 3: Reaction and Last Data Exfiltration. These countermeasures bought management the time to decide on a complete cut-off from the Internet until remediation was finished. The collected IOCs from the forensic analyses, OSINT searches, the observed TTPs, and analogies between the RAT and the HyperBro malware pointed to an attribution to the Emissary Panda1 group, which was also consistent with the authorities' previous assumption.One of the most interesting facts was the determined entry vector: all identified traces date back exactly to March 04, 2021, the day when the large-scale exploitation of the ProxyLogon vulnerability started. The first system to show C2 traffic was the Exchange server, and within less than an hour, additional systems were affected. While the Exchange Server compromise was detected in March and the system was recovered during that time, the other infected systems were not detected, leaving the door open for the actor. The entire sequence of events leads to the assumption that the exploitation of ProxyLogon in this case was not an opportunistic attack. When asked by the customer's top management if they could imagine being on the short list of a Chinese actor, they indicated that they were aware of this risk.1 url aka APT27, TG-3390, Bronze Union, Lucky Mouse, Iron Tiger, UNC215© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 2 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell 2 The Major Vulnerabilities in 2021 As in every year, many vulnerabilities were discovered in 2021, for which vendors released hotfixes, administrators hopefully applied them, and security personnel reviewed infrastructure for successful remediation. Meanwhile, hackers developed exploits and used them to compromise the remaining vulnerable systems and gain an advantage. Business as usual? However, one thing has changed in the last year: The quality of some discovered vulnerabilities was outstanding in terms of the software affected, the ease of exploitation and impact, and the frequency of occurrence was higher than ever before. However, things have also changed on the attackers' side: Some of these vulnerabilities were discovered not with good intentions by security researchers. They were searched for in order to use them for attack campaigns. This resulted in exploits being available early and widespread exploitation by various actors, sometimes even before the affected organizations could react. Looking back at 2021, the following vulnerabilities, among others, immediately come to mind: □ Microsoft Exchange was affected by several security vulnerabilities in 2021, whichbecame very critical mainly due to chaining them in attacks.□In March 2021, ProxyLogon2, often publicly referred to as Hafnium, was finally made public, while rumors of targeted exploitation had already existed since November 2020. Immediately following the disclosure, a previously unseen wave of widespread exploitation followed before most organizations could respond and some were not even aware of the vulnerability. During this time, we analyzed 84 Microsoft Exchange instances from various customers with our preferred APT scanner THOR3 and found that 96% of them were scanned for ProxyLogon and in 44% of the cases the vulnerability was also exploited.Figure 1: Scanning and exploitation of ProxyLogon in Germany.2 CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065 3 url© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 3 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell□ ProxyLogon was just one vulnerability in a whole series of vulnerabilities that put Exchange environments at risk. There were also ProxyOracle, ProxyShell, ProxyToken, and other Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities4 with publicly available exploits, as this collection shows: url We received some customer requests to analyze compromised Exchange servers, claiming to have fixed the ProxyLogon vulnerability and not being able to explain how this could happen.□ Remarkably, the attention of administrators, security experts and the trade press decreased from vulnerability to vulnerability - despite vendor advisories, available exploits, and warnings about active abuse. The Exchange issue became annoying, we heard more than once "I just can't patch Exchange anymore" and reports about it were no longer clickbait.□In August 2021, Atlassian's Confluence was affected by an easy-to-exploit RCE vulnerability5 due to a OGNL injection. Shortly after the disclosure, ready-to-use exploits were available, and widespread exploitation attempts were observed on the Internet. In this case, many publicly accessible environments were also compromised. In contrast to ProxyLogon, we received comparatively few requests for proactive analysis, but more requests for post-breach analysis.□ The RCE vulnerability in the widely used Java library log4j6, also known as log4shell, once again generated a lot of attention on the part of defenders and attackers in December 2021. Again, it took only a few hours before the first widespread scans for affected systems and exploitation attempts began. With the previously mentioned vulnerabilities, it was easy to assess whether an organization was affected, and the scope of analysis was limited to individual systems. In the case of log4shell, on the other hand, the effort was higher, and especially the proof of successful exploitation was laborious, as it had to be provided for each system individually7. Since it was close to Christmas and many employees were already on vacation, some organizations decided to fix the vulnerability as part of their regular patch cycle and hope that they would not fall victim to an attack. Even though the number of attacks has decreased in early 2022, we and many other security experts8 believe that there are still many undiscovered vulnerabilities whose impact will only become apparent in the coming months, and that many applications will remain vulnerable for a long time.4 ProxyOracle: CVE-2021-31196 and CVE-2021-31195; ProxyShell: CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523 and CVE-2021- 31207; ProxyToken: CVE-2021-33766; another RCE CVE-2021-42321 5 CVE-2021-26084 6 CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-44832 7 url 8 url© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 4 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shellFigure 2: Timeline of release, global attention, and breach detection of selected vulnerabilities in 2021.Looking at the various players who were looking for, and in some cases abusing vulnerable systems, four categories can be distinguished based on their motivation and impact: □ As usual, many security researchers have tried to map the attack surface and/or to warn the affected organizations. Even if they do not compromise systems during scanning, they leave traces. Operators must spend time to figure out the intent of the attack attempt. □ The largest group were script kiddies and hobbyists who tried to exploit these vulnerabilities for fun or to achieve certain smaller goals like deploying crypto miners or web shells9. Since they usually do not try to move laterally, the impact was limited to the compromised system.□ The group with the most attention were opportunistic cybercrime gangs, especially ransomware groups, or professional hackers with the goal of sabotaging and extorting organizations or placing backdoors and selling access to companies on the black market. In case of successful ransomware attacks, high financial and business impact was caused.□ But there is a fourth group, often overlooked, that has benefited from the scatter fire of the previously mentioned attackers: APT groups and advanced hackers. Because their attacks are more targeted, the total number of attacks is lower. The number of unreported cases is also much higher, as the impact is not as obvious to the public as in the case of ransomware. The actual impact through stolen information and intellectual property is also difficult to assess. Since many victims are not aware of the risk of becoming victims of espionage, APT groups are often underestimated as actors.9 IOCs from a ProxyShell exploitation: url© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 5 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell3 A Spotlight on the Role of APT Groups Based on the knowledge that APT groups also exploited these vulnerabilities, which is not at all surprising, we conducted more in-depth research and correlated IOCs with related IR engagements. In doing so, we made an interesting observation. ProxyLogon played a special role among last year's high-profile vulnerabilities, as it was not only widely abused by APT groups. The more prominent name "Hafnium" is not derived from the metal, but from the APT group Hafnium. Shortly after the critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange became public, there were many reports about APT groups actively abusing this flaw: □ Hafnium10, which is suspected being first in detecting and exploiting those vulnerabilities11: □ Emissary Panda12, whose activities we describe in more detail in this document. □ Fancy Bear13, which is known to attack Microsoft Exchange instances for a long time14 and recently newactivities in Germany were observed.□ Tick, Calypso, Websiic, Winnti Group15 and a not precisely specified Iranian government-sponsoredAPT actor16 and certainly, many groups more.As for the critical RCE in Confluence, the situation seems to be completely different. If you search reports, blogs, and other security feeds, you will mainly find information about abuse to deploy crypto miners. For the time being, we can confirm this observation, as we have also found this behavior in various investigations of compromised Confluence servers. In addition, there are single reports that ransomware groups also occasionally abuse this vulnerability. To our knowledge, there have been several instances where attackers exploited this vulnerability shortly after its disclosure, installed RAT tools, and waited for a highly privileged administrator to log in. Once control over the infrastructure was established, all the victim's systems were started to be encrypted. So far, nothing has been found in the public about the connection between APT groups and the use of the OGNL injection vulnerability to gain a foothold in victims' infrastructures. During malware analysis of the Emissary Panda incident mentioned earlier, we found an additional C2 IP in the configuration. This IP has never been reported as malicious or abused and appears to be part of Emissary Panda's dedicated infrastructure and not a compromised third-party system.10 url aka Operation Exchange Marauder 11 url 12 url aka APT27, TG-3390, Bronze Union, Lucky Mouse, Iron Tiger, UNC215 13 url aka APT28, Sofacy, Pawn Storm, Strontium, Tasr Team 14 url 15 url 16 url© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 6 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell Thanks to the detailed tracking of all IOCs of our incidents in a MISP17, the correlations between the events were easily identified due to the C2 IP. These events belong to analyses of compromised Confluence servers that were previously performed and revealed crypto miner infections, but no evidence of RATs or lateral movement. In a few analyses, we identified this IP as a node scanning for vulnerable Confluence systems. Knowing that this IP is part of Emissary Panda's infrastructure and was rarely used in their campaigns suggests that Emissary Panda was also scanning for vulnerable Confluence instances. Thus, the tactic of “flying under the radar” was a complete success.Figure 3: Correlation of a so far unknown Emissary Panda C2 IP to IR engagements of compromised Confluence servers.In contrast, the log4shell vulnerability in log4j received more attention from the security community, IT organizations, and the press - not just the specialist press. But all kinds of attackers were also attracted to this vulnerability. One reason for this could also be that the effort required to identify and mitigate the vulnerability is much higher for the affected organizations, making it more likely for attackers to benefit from exploitation capabilities over a longer period. Reports and alerts were published very quickly18, reminding again to take preventive measures, as almost the same APT groups as ProxyLogon were seen actively exploiting the vulnerability: □ Charming Kitten - an Iranian government-sponsored actor □ And many groups more Although there have not yet been any incident response deployments where the entry vector has been identified as a log4shell misuse, we expect this to happen within the next few weeks or months, which is still the average time to breach discovery.17 url 18 url turkey/ and url 19 url© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 7 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell 4 Lessons Learned from 2021 Looking ahead to 2022 and the following years, we do not assume that there will be fewer critical vulnerabilities and attacks. Rather, the opposite will be the case! Therefore, every organization must think about how it is going to deal with the threat situation in the future. Prediction: It becomes more and more important to be in front of the wave! □ This can be achieved by implementing mechanisms that provide early warnings about newly discovered vulnerabilities, remediation actions, and hotfixes. The most reliable source are the manufacturers' advisory feeds, since relying on the specific press or warnings from authorities naturally entails a certain time delay and should therefore only be the fallback solution. In order to quickly assess whether and to what extent you are affected by a vulnerability, a good knowledge of your infrastructure and especially the publicly accessible parts - regardless of whether they are on-premises or in a cloud - is crucial, i.e., a well-filled Configuration Management Database (CMDB) / asset management is a must. In addition, it is helpful to be aware of the threat situation, incorporate it into your risk analysis, and plan appropriate countermeasures. While any company can fall victim to opportunistic cybercrime, assessing the likelihood of targeted attacks is more difficult. Despite all the challenges, it is negligent to ignore these risks. Even if protection against targeted attacks is not the primary goal, early implementation of protective measures is an investment in the future, as cybercriminals often mimic the TTPs of APT groups.□□Protection: Defined processes and workflows for rapid reaction are key! □In order to be able to act quickly in the event of a newly discovered threat, a coordinated and tested processes must be in place. While normal patch management processes often allow a grace period of a few days or even several weeks before patches must be applied, emergency processes must be in place to react within a few hours in such cases.□ A patch is not always immediately available or applicable, so a range of containment measures must be prepared, for example in the case of ProxyLogon, which blocks Internet access to Outlook Web App and ActiveSync. The impact on business processes must be considered, and appropriate Business Continuity Management (BCM) plans with decision criteria and authorities must be defined. Especially when critical business services are affected, it is difficult to make the decision between business impact and IT infrastructure compromise without being prepared.□ Another important aspect is to be able to act at any time. Many vulnerabilities become known shortly before the weekend or during the vacation season. Attackers are distributed all over the world and sometimes specifically wait for such off-peak times. You must be able to react to a changed threat situation at any time - both on the technical and on the management level.□ As the handling of ProxyOracle, ProxyShell, and to some extent the Confluence vulnerability has shown, the resources of many IT departments were overloaded, which delayed remediation or even led to resignation. As with operational incidents, time reserves must be planned for security incidents, both in the security teams and in IT.© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 8 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell □ Not all attackers exploit vulnerabilities immediately, sometimes they wait until the first waves are over and thus the attention dies down. Even if there are no exploits available for every vulnerability or active exploitation has been observed, the reverse conclusion does not apply here that these are less critical. Every high-rated or critical vulnerability must be equally important to you.Detection and response: Be prepared for the next high-profile vulnerability! □ Capabilities are needed to determine appropriate strategies and techniques for detecting potentially compromised assets, identifying exploitation attempts, evaluating whether they have been successful, and recommending next steps or even directly initiating forensic investigations. Such capabilities should be considered sovereign tasks, as the resources of security service providers are also limited. Similar events such as ProxyLogon or log4shell may cause bottlenecks, especially if no contracts have been concluded beforehand.□□ The average time to detection of successful attacks needs to be shortened, as huge spread and damage can occur within a period of three to six months. For opportunistic attacks, the time periods are much shorter, but the past has shown that with a quick and rigorous response, even ransomware attacks can successfully be stopped before encryption begins. If systems have been compromised or suspicions have been raised, a thorough analysis of the level of compromise of the entire environment is critical. At a minimum, the analysis objectives must be If you underestimate this step, you may miss the chance to get ahead of the attackers and stop them at the beginning of the attack chain, as the following sections show."Can the known IOCs be detected on other systems?" "What credentials may have been exposed and has data been exfiltrated?"© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 9 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell INSIGHTS INTO AN EMISSARY PANDA ATTACK 5 Timeline of the Attack The attack can roughly be divided in three phases. □ The first phase was the initial compromise and achievement of objectives. The objectives included theprivilege escalation and espionage of intellectual property.□ The second phase was the persistence phase, which lasted for seven months. □In the final phase, the attackers changed their persistence strategy from Phase 2 and attempted to exfiltrate data again. This was likely a reaction to a detection of an attack to another company with the same IOCs.Figure 4: Attack PhasesThe following table describes the timeline of the attack with anonymous hostnames.

It is assumed that the initial compromise occurred shortly before this event. Since the first C2 communication originated from the Exchange Server, and the event occurred very close to the first disclosure of the ProxyLogon vulnerability by Microsoft, the initial access vector is assumed to be ProxyLogon. About an hour after the initial compromise, Emissary Panda moved laterally to the file server as well as to a client. On both of these systems the HyperBro backdoor was dropped, as described in Section 8. On the same day, a file with the name “Rar.exe” was created on the server fileserver. The fact that the fileserver was the first target, and the creation of “Rar.exe”, support the thesis that the main objective of the attack was espionage of intellectual property. With full access to the fileserver the objectives were fulfilled in the first days of the attack.© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 12 of 38Phase 2: PersistenceHvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell After the objectives of initial access and data exfiltration were fulfilled, the next objective of this APT was persistence and remaining undetected (long-term access). These objectives were achieved in Phase 2 of the attack, which lasted from 08.03.2021 to 18.10.2021. During this time, only sparse activity from Emissary Panda was identified. The activity includes regular beaconing to C2 addresses. Furthermore, irregular lateral movement to new systems was identified. This was probably performed to strengthen their persistence and protect their access against system replacements. At least two new systems were compromised during Phase 2.Phase 3: Reaction and Last Data Exfiltration5.3 In the last phase of the attack, something tipped Emissary Panda of, and they started to change their behavior. Our best guess is that they noticed responsive actions in other attack campaigns using the same C2 infrastructure. Since the first activity in this phase was on 18.10.2021, and our IR Kick-off was in the following week, it is unlikely that we tipped them of at this point in the attack. The last phase of their attack lasted from 18.10.2021 to the forced end of the attack on 09.11.2021. which was done before the first response actions of this incident had been performed. Furthermore, they strengthened their foothold in the network by more lateral movement and compromising more critical systems, which is described in Section 6.9. Their last uprising was observed on 09.11.2022. First, they started with reconnaissance by pulling a task list of the File server from the compromised Intranet server (Section 6.8.2). Next, they prepared for data collection by creating “Rar.exe” (WinRar) remotely on the fileserver. It is unclear why Emissary Panda started testing user credentials after the creation of WinRar, since they were already using a working Domain Admin and the collection of data was running as well. Moreover, the operator of Emissary Panda mixed up the order of username and password, which explains why the credentials did not work. Due to the mix- up, the operators probably thought that their stolen credentials have been revoked. Hence, in the following they tried to steal new credentials by executing Mimikatz and exporting the registry. This chaos in operations leads us to the conclusion that different phases of the attack are executed by teams with different capabilities. The initial compromise, privilege escalation, lateral movement and data exfiltration is probably performed by higher-skilled teams, while later phases of the attack such as maintaining persistence are executed by less skilled teams. The mix-up is described in more technical detail in Section 6.8.1. Meanwhile the IR team had detected the activity and taken first measures to stop the data exfiltration. While the Internet cut-off was being prepared, responders started to disrupt the attackers. In order to stop the collection process, WinRar processes were terminated remotely, and the tools used by the attackers were manipulated and therefore “disarmed”. Of course, this was not a permanent solution, but it bought responders and the management more time to prepare the Internet cut-off. As soon as the attackers realized that the process was stopped and they couldn’t launch it again, they moved to the next compromised system and started the collection process from there. Shortly after the last observed activity the attack was stopped by cutting off internet access. This was maintained for two weeks until all remediation measures were implemented.© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 13 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell 6 Description of Observed TTPs The following figure maps the observed Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures (TTPs), observed during the Emissary Panda attack to the TTPs listed by MITRE ATT&CK21:ResourceDev elopmentInitial Modif y Sy stem Modif y Sy stem or Serv iceT1036.005:MatchLegitimate Nameor LocationT1112: AccountsFigure 6: Observed TTPs for Emissary Panda mapped to MITRE ATT&CKThe following subsections explain the observations for each technique and helps to understand the attack in detail.21 url© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 14 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell 6.1 Resource Development 6.1.1 Develop Capabilities: Malware (T1587.001) The attack heavily relied on the use of the HyperBro Remote Access Tool (RAT). According to our knowledge as well as several sources on the Internet22 23, this malware is only used by Emissary Panda. Hence, HyperBro is most likely developed by the threat actor itself. The backdoor relies on DLL Search Order Hijacking and DLL Side-loading, as described in Section 6.4. Furthermore, commands sent by the attacker are executed in-memory and do not create secondary artifacts, which complicates the forensic analysis. A detailed analysis of the malware is performed in Section Malware Analysis of HyperBro.Initial Access Exploit Public-Facing Application (T1190)6.2 6.2.1 The initial access to the victim’s infrastructure was performed by exploiting the ProxyLogon vulnerability. The vulnerability became apparent to the public when Microsoft published a blog post on 02.03.2021 stating that a new critical Exchange vulnerability was being actively exploited by attackers24. The first communication of the victim’s Exchange servers with the C2 IP addresses occurred on 04.03.2021. Furthermore, the Exchange servers were the first systems to communicate with the malicious IP addresses. Although, the initial system could not be forensically analyzed, the Firewall logs, the timing of Microsoft’s publication, and the first communication are sufficient to assume, that the initial access vector was in fact ProxyLogon. This leads to the conclusion that Emissary Panda used the exploitation of the public-facing Exchange server for their initial access.6.3 Execution 6.3.1 Windows Management Instrumentation (T1047) Emissary Panda was observed to utilize the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute malware, scripts, commands, and collection tools. $ wmic /node:<HOSTNAME> process call create "cmd /c c:\perflogs\vfhost.exe" $ wmic /node:<IP> process call create "cmd /c c:\perflogs\vfhost.exe" $ wmic /node:<IP> process call create "cmd /c c:\temp\vfhost.exe" $ wmic /node:<IP> process call create "cmd /c d:\$recycle.bin\bin.bat" $ wmic /node:<IP> process call create " Rar.exe a d:\<PATH>\log "E:\<TARGET_DIR_1>\" "E:\<TARGET_DIR_2>\" "H:\<TARGET_DIR_3>\*.xls*" "E:\<TARGET_DIR_4>\" "H:\ <TARGET_DIR_3>\*.csv" "E:\<TARGET_DIR_5>\" "E:\ <TARGET_DIR_6>\" d:\Users\Homes\<USER>\ -r -y -hpC0yHvnGojFe9aqyM5VqT9ik4tkVnuKkPk8t -v5444M"22 url 23 url 24 url© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 15 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell The first three lines show the remote execution of the HyperBro malware on different systems using different locations. In preparation to this remote execution, the corresponding malware files were dropped over an SMB connection authenticated by a legit domain admin. Following the placement of the malware, it is executed remotely with WMIC by referencing the remote system with its IP or hostname. The fourth command shows the same technique for a malicious Batch script. Last, the collection tool was executed remotely with the same technique. The specified partitions (D:\ and E:\) are located on the target system. Hence, the collection tool was also placed on the target 6.4.1 Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service (T1543.003) The threat actor has utilized Windows Services to achieve persistence of their HyperBro backdoor. The Windows service has the following settings: Name = windefenders Display = Windows Defenders ImagePath = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\windefenders\msmpeng.exe" Type = 0x0 Start = Auto Start Group = The path of the service points to the malware, which was dropped at this location beforehand. Furthermore, the service is set to Auto Start to ensure persistence. Prior to creating this service, the threat actor created a similar service with the name windefende-921919155 but deleted it within a few seconds. This behavior was observed multiple times with variations in numbers. Hence, the service names windefende-[0-9]{9} could also serve as IOCs. 6.4.2 Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys (T1547.001) Another observed way of persistence was the utilization of a Registry run key for the current user. The key being used for persistence had the following name: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\windefenders This is a backup mechanism for the establishment of persistence, if the compromise account does not have enough privileges for the creation of a Windows Service 6.4.3 Valid Accounts: Domain Accounts (T1078.002) and Local Accounts (T1078.003) During the attack, valid accounts were used for Persistence, Lateral Movement, Defense Evasion, Execution as well as Collection. Hence, there is no optimal sub-section for the placement of this technique. The accounts included both local accounts, such as the built-in administrator, as well as domain accounts, which were mainly domain administrators.© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 16 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell 6.5 Privilege Escalation Since the initial access with the exploitation of ProxyLogon (Section 6.2) provided the attacker already with system-level access to an Exchange server, and dumping of credentials (Section 6.7.1) provided a local administrator account and a domain admin account (Section 6.4.3), which could be used for lateral movement, there was no need for escalating privileges.6.6 Defense Evasion 6.6.1 Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Search Order Hijacking (T1574.001) and DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002) As described in multiple reports25 26, Emissary Panda often drops a legit application, which then side-loads a malicious DLL. Since Windows first searches for the DLL in the same directory as the application is launched27, the malicious DLL is loaded even if the original DLL exists on the target system. Hence, the DLL search order is hijacked by placing the files in the same directory. The following two files are placed in the same directory to perform DLL Search Order Hijacking (T1574.001) and DLL Side-Loading: Renamed, but legit application signed by CyberArk28 Malicious DLL containing backdoor□ msmpeng.exe □ vftrace.dllAfter placing the files in one directory, the msmpeng.exe is executed, which then loads the vftrace.dll. Hence, the malicious code of the DLL is running in the context of a legit application. 6.6.2 Modify Registry (T1112) The configuration of the malware is stored in the Windows Registry. Therefore, the Registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\config_ is used. The following values are stored under this key: .msmpeng.exe.vftrace.dll Files\windefenders\.<company_name>.0101.windefenders.windefenders.Windows Defenders.Windows Defenders The configuration information includes, the filenames, the service name used for persistence, and C2 IPs as well as C2 domains.thumb.dat1C:\Program Files (x86)\Common25 url 26 url 27 url tails© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 17 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell Besides storing their C2 configuration in the registry, Emissary Panda modified an existing registry key. Due to modifying the following registry key, they activated the storage of clear text passwords after logon in WDigest: Reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest\ /v UseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1 This forces logon credentials to be stored in clear text, which can then be dumped by tools like Mimikatz, as described in Section 6.7.1. 6.6.3 Process Injection: Process Hollowing (1055.012) Since most of the manually executed commands, such as reconnaissance, were executed in the context of the legit process wermgr.exe, it is concluded that Emissary Panda performed process hollowing to avoid detection by security tools. This thesis is supported by the fact, that the executable related to the process ID is the legit wermgr.exe of Windows. Furthermore, the capability for process hollowing as well as the corresponding strings within the malware were identified during our malware analysis of HyperBro, which is described in Section 8.3. The following screenshot shows an excerpt of the EDR tool, which displays the reconnaissance activity in the context of wermgr.exe:Figure 7: Process Hollowing used to execute malicious commands in the context of legit wermgr.exe6.6.4 Masquerading: Service (T1036.004), filename, and file location (T1036.005) On several occasions, Emissary Panda tried to evade defenses by using names, which are associated with security tools. This fact was also mentioned in previous reports29. In the referenced reports, Emissary Panda used a legitimate Symantec executable. In the case of this attack, Emissary Panda used an executable, which is signed by CyberArk and named as the Microsoft Defender. Furthermore, the executable was placed in common paths for Microsoft Defender: □ C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\windefenders\msmpeng.exe □ C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\windefenders\vftrace.dll □ D:\$recycle.bin\ As already mentioned in Section 6.4.1, the service used for persistence was also named after the Microsoft Defender. Last, the recycle bin was utilized to store the output-archives of the collection tool, as described in The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell 6.7 Credential Access 6.7.1 OS Credential Dumping T1003 In order to gain valid credentials of accounts, Emissary Panda used techniques for credential dumping. This also explains the extensive use of valid accounts, as described in Section 6.4.3. The following command was observed during the attack: $ msiexec.exe privilege::debug sekurlsa::logonPasswords The command line parameters equal the parameters of the credential dumping tool Mimikatz30. Since the process is running in a valid msiexec process, the attacker performed credential dumping in combination 6.8.1 Account Discovery (T1087.001) and Permission Groups Discovery T1069 To gain more information about the Active Directory accounts and groups, Emissary Panda utilized the classic Windows net tool. $ net user <USER> /domain $ net1 user <ADMIN> /domain $ net group "domain admins" /domain $ net view \\<IP> $ net use \\<IP>\ipc$ <PASSWORD> ********** Apparently, the operator of Emissary Panda mixed up the order of username and password in the net use command. Hence, the password could be seen in clear-text and the username was redacted by the EDR. 6.8.2 Process Discovery T1057 Emissary Panda used the Tasklist utility to remotely gather information about running processes on systems. The following command shows a remote execution of Tasklist, which stores the outputs to a file located in the Recycle Bin: $ wmic /node:<IP> process call create "cmd /c tasklist >d:\$recycle.bin\task.dat"6.8.3 System Information Discovery (T1082) As a preparation for the data collection, Emissary Panda checked the used disk space of their target directories. The following command shows how they gained the used disk space for a home directory of a User, located on the fileserver: $ diruse /m /* \\<IP>\d$\Users\Homes\<USER> The command outputs the used disk space in Megabyte.30 url© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 19 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell 6.9 Lateral Movement 6.9.1 The threat actor utilized SMB shares to drop malware on remote systems. Following, the execution of the malware was performed as described in Section 6.3.1. In order to access SMB shares on remote systems, Emissary Panda used valid accounts as described in Section 6.4.3.Remote Services: SMB Shares (T1021.002)6.10 Collection 6.10.1 Archive via Utility (T1560.001) and Automated Collection (T1119) Based on the observed hashes and parameters, Emissary Panda was using Winrar to collect data in archives. The following commands show data collection performed on the fileserver: $ Rar.exe a d:\<PATH>\log "E:\<TARGET_DIR_1>\" "E:\<TARGET_DIR_2>\" "H:\ <TARGET_DIR_3>\*.xls*" "E:\<TARGET_DIR_4>\" "H:\<TARGET_DIR_3>\*.csv" "E:\ <TARGET_DIR_5>\" "E:\<TARGET_DIR_6>\" d:\Users\Homes\<USER>\ -r -y - $ Rar.exe a \\<IP_1>\d$\$recycle.bin\bin.rar "\\<IP_2>\E$\<TARGET_DIR_1>\" "\\<IP_2>\E$\<TARGET_DIR_2>\" "\\<IP_2>\h$\<TARGET_DIR_3>\*.xls*" "\\<IP_2>\E$\<TARGET_DIR_4>\" "\\<IP_2>\h$\<TARGET_DIR_3>\*.csv" "\\<IP_2>\E$\<TARGET_DIR_5>\" \\<IP_2>\d$\Users\Homes\<USER>\ -r -y -inul - hpC0yHvnGojFe9aqyM5VqT9ik4tkVnuKkPk8t -v5767M The first command was launched remotely via WMIC on the fileserver. The collected files as well as the output archive is located on the fileserver. The second command writes its output not to the fileserver but to another compromised system in the recycle bin. Both commands use the same password to encrypt the archives (incl. file and directory names). Finally, both commands use different sizes for their partial archives, but the target directories are the same. 6.10.2 Data Staged (T1074) As can be seen in the commands of the Section 6.10.1, the output of the collection is staged. This means that the first command creates partial archives of 5444 MB and the second command of 5767 MB. The partial archives are exfiltrated directly after creation and deleted afterwards.© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 20 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell 6.11 Command and Control 6.11.1 Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols T1071.001 The C2 communication was performed over HTTPS, which could be observed in the firewall logs. Since the content was encrypted no statement regarding the content can be made. Nevertheless, the backdoor on all compromised systems was sending beacons to the C2 IP addresses in regular intervals. Via memory analysis of a compromised systems the following post request with User Agent could be extracted: POST /api/v2/ajax HTTP/1.1 Connection: Keep-Alive User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/34.0.1847.116 Safari/537.36 Content-Length: 87 The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell 7 OSINT analysis of C2 infrastructure Observed C2 communication as well as HyperBro artifacts were analyzed and researched for additional indicators and common attributes. In the analyzed samples, HyperBro uses a HTTPS protocol endpoint under the following path: /api/v2/ajax. This is a unique web application path, which is very well suited for detecting HyperBro traffic. No legitimate applications or web installations have been identified that access this endpoint. Furthermore, we noted that multiple Emissary Panda C2 addresses share the identical Jarm hash *.cybo-cloud.com certificate: NamesCN=*.cybo-cloud.com C=US, O=DigiCert Inc, OU=www.digicert.com, CN=RapidSSL RSA CA 2018 2018-01-22 00:00:00 to 2021-04-21 12:00:00 (1185 days, 12:00:00) *.cybo-cloud.com cybo-cloud.com We were able to directly confirm seven C2 IP addresses with this specific Jarm hash and TLS certificate combination. Passive DNS data suggests that also the following IP addresses might be related to Emissary Panda as these share the Jarm hash and TLS certificate as well. However, at the time of writing, this suspicion was not confirmed. In addition, it was observed that Emissary Panda reacted to incident response activities via resolving their their C2 traffic. Hence, active HyperBro backdoors on webservers might be identified by reviewing the local access log for requests to the following path: /api/v2/ajax.© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 22 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell 8 Malware Analysis of HyperBro As described in other public reports31, HyperBro is a custom malware of Emissary Panda used as RAT. An analysis32 of the HyperBro version used in this attack campaign was recently published by the German domestic intelligence services (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz, BfV). In addition to this publication, we provide additional technical details about the inner workings and capabilities of the malware. Furthermore, we created and published a tool, which is able to extract the configuration from the malware. This enables analysts to quickly retrieve the IOCs from HyperBro samples. Finally, this chapter also summarizes the capabilities and available C2 commands of HyperBro.8.1 Overview The HyperBro malware consists of the following components: Component msmpeng.exe / vfhost.exe Legit application signed by CyberArk33, used for DLL Side-Loading vftrace.dll (Stage 1) thumb.dat (Stage 2)Malicious DLL containing Stage 1 / the first loader The file is encrypted with a weak one-byte key. After decryption, it contains a loader for the PE Executable, which is also contained as compressed buffer within the thumb.datDescriptionPE Executable (Stage 3) Contains the actual HyperBro backdoor written in C++ config.iniCreated after the first execution and contains a randomly generated GUIDTo launch HyperBro, the legit CyberArk application msmpeng.exe / vfhost.exe is executed. Due to DLL Search Order Hijacking and DLL Side-Loading, as described in Section 6.6.1, this application loads the malicious vftrace.dll. We refer to vftrace.dll as Stage 1 of the malware. The malicious DLL then opens and reads thumb.dat, which we refer to as Stage 2. This file is encrypted with a weak one-byte key. It contains a loader and a compressed PE Executable. The loader decompresses the PE Executable within the thumb.dat and prepares it for execution. The decompressed PE Executable then contains the actual HyperBro backdoor, which we refer to as Stage 3. The exact process of decryption, decompression, and loading is explained in more detail in the following sections. The complete process is depicted in Figure 8.31 url 32 url tails© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 23 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell 8.2 PE Loader As displayed in Figure 8, the first stage opens and decrypts the thumb.dat file. Figure 9 shows a screenshot of the decryption routine (first red box) and the launch of the decrypted PE Loader. The decryption routine simply adds the byte 0xfc to each byte of the thumb.dat file. This is a rather simple encryption with a one-byte key, which can easily be reproduced.Figure 8: Malware FlowThe decrypted thumb.dat file contains the second stage, which is referenced to as the PE Loader, as well as a compressed PE file. The used compression method for Stage 3 is LZNT134. Since the vftrace.dll simply jumps to the beginning of the PE Loader, no functions are loaded or linked. Effectively, the program is started with no linked or imported functions. Hence, the PE Loader needs to initialize itself.34 url© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 24 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shellFigure 9: Decryption of thumb.dat and launch of PE LoaderA rather special method was chosen for this initialization. The loader contains a set of pairs of library and function names (both hashed with a custom hash function). To resolve the function, the Thread Information Block (TIB) of the current process is loaded. Afterwards the Process Environment Block (PEB) is accessed, and the loaded modules are iterated to find the searched library. Following, the export table of the library is parsed to find the function.Figure 10: Structure with function pointers after resolving procedure via hashing© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 25 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell As stated before, the library and function names are stored in a hashed form. The utilized hash function was only seen in one other public report from Palo Altos’ Unit 42 published in 2017. The result of the function resolution via the hashing algorithm is a structure containing several functions pointer, as can be seen in Figure 10.Figure 11: Parameters of decompress buffer functions of PE LoaderNext, the loader invokes a function that is used for decompressing the PE file contained in the decrypted thumb.dat. The parameters of the function can be seen in Figure 11, while the function itself is display in Figure 12.Figure 12: Decompress buffer function of PE LoaderAfter successful execution the decompress_buffer function, another function parses the decompressed buffer, which is the third stage (PE Executable), loads its sections into memory, sets up the correct permissions on its memory pages, and finally launches the third stage. An excerpt of the launch_payload function can be seen in Figure 13.© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 26 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shellFigure 13: Stage 3 launcherSince the PE loader has effectively no import table, but only a structure of function pointers, it is less likely to be detected by Antivirus products. The products often look for suspicious library functions, which are loaded by a program, for example WinHttp. The result of the PE loader is a loaded and launched third stage.© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 27 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell 8.3 Capabilities The actual backdoor (Stage 3) shows sophisticated capabilities regarding remote access and command and control, as well as persistence and evasion. The following classes were found during the analysis, which provide a first indication of the functionality of □ TDirve (not a typo) □ TShellMgrFurthermore, the malware has the capability to gain persistence in multiple ways on the target system. One way is the creation of a Windows Service, as described in Section 3.4.1. Another way is the creation of a Run Key within the Windows Registry, as described in Section 6.4.2. Stage 3 is a sophisticated backdoor with various capabilities. It is controlled from a C2 server, which provides commands to the backdoor by responding to HTTPS requests originating from the backdoor. The first byte of the HTTPS response contains a byte specifying the command for the backdoor. Based on the command the backdoor executes one of eight operations. The table in this subsection describes the operations of Stage 3.© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 28 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shellCommand code No operation / Wait for commands Initial Logon to C2 server.

In order to develop such a tool, we reverse engineered the malware and re-implemented the decryption of thumb.dat, the decompression of Stage 3, and implemented a configuration parser for Stage 3. The tool can be found in our GitHub Repository: url The tool runs through the steps from the thumb.dat as input to the decompressed PE file (Stage 3), as displayed in Figure 8. $ python3 HyperBro_extract_config.py -i thumb.dat -k fc [*] The key is: 0xfc [*] Decryption successful [*] Decompression of PE successful [*] HyperBro extracted config: Legit launcher used for DLL-Side-Loading: msmpeng.exe Stage 1: vftrace.dll Stage 2: thumb.dat Stage 3: thumb.dat Malware Directory: windefenders Domain (changed at runtime): Default Windows Service used for persistence: Windows Defenders User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/34.0.1847.116 Safari/537.36 HTTPS Request Information: POSTurl Pipe name used for IPC: \\.\pipe\testpipe At first, the thumb.dat file needs to be decrypted. Therefore, we analyzed the decryption algorithm contained in Stage 1 and extracted the corresponding key. Since the key is only one byte long, and it is simply added to each byte of the thumb.dat, the encryption is not very strong. To increase the stability of our tool, a brute-force function for the one-byte key was implemented as well as a detection for a correct decryption. After the correct key is found, the thumb.dat is decrypted. Next, the beginning of the PE file is identified in the decrypted thumb.dat. The file consists of the PE Loader (Stage 2), and a compressed PE file (Stage 3). As stage 3 is compressed with LZNT1, a LZNT1 compressed PE header is used as a signature to identify the start of Stage 3. Next, the compressed PE file can be decompressed, which results in the actual HyperBro backdoor. Last, the configuration of Stage 3 is parsed by the tool, i.e., it extracts multiple hard-coded parameters, like the IP of the initial C2 server, the user agent utilized in HTTP requests, etc. An example of the output can be seen above In this case, the key is specified as a command-line parameter. The resulting IoCs as well as their utilization for detection, are described in more detail in Section 7.© HvS-Consulting AG 2022Page 30 of 38HvS Incident Response Report The APT Fallout of Vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, OGNL Injection and log4shell 9 Detection of Emissary Pandas activitiesIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)9.1 The IOCs in this section were partially collected during the incident and partially gathered via OSINT research.
