1/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxTargeting Portugal: A new trojan ‘Lampion’ has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & Taxseguranca-informatica.pt/targeting-portugal-a-new-trojan-lampion-has-spread-using-template-emails-from-the-portuguese-government-ﬁnance- 26 de dezembro de 2019Last days of 2019 were the perfect time to spread phishing campaigns using email templates based on the Portuguese Government Finance & Tax. SI-LAB noted that Portuguese users were targeted with malscam messages that reported issues related to a debt of the year 2018.In detail, the emails are related to the Rendimento de Pessoas Singulares – IRS (annual tax declaration), and any citizen who has received the message can be misled by criminals – as the end of the year is the right time to discuss issues within this context.The malware was named ‘Lampion’ as this is the name used as part of its internal name. Regarding a broad analysis, it looks like the Trojan-Banker.Win32.ChePro family, but with improvements that make hard its detection and analysis.In brief, when the victim clicks on the links available in the email body the malware is downloaded from the online server. The downloaded ﬁle is a compressed ﬁle (.zip) called: FacturaNovembro-4492154-2019-10_8.zip.As observed, after extracting the ﬁle, three ﬁles are presented.urlﬁnance-tax/#.Xh… 1/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxThe ﬁle “FacturaNovembro-4492154-2019-10_8.vbs” is the ﬁrst stage of the Lampion’s infection chain. This is a Visual Basic Script (VBScript) ﬁle that is acting as a dropper and downloader. It downloads the next stage from the compromised server available on the Internet on an AWS S3 bucket.The trojan Lampion uses anti-debug and anti-vm techniques. The use of a commercial protector known as VMProtector 3.x and also specially crafted codes make it difﬁcult to analyze both on a sandbox environment or manually.After the VBScript ﬁle is executed, two ﬁles are downloaded: P-19-2.dll and 0.zip. The P-19-2.dll ﬁle (Lampion) is a PE File that is executed during a VBScript execution when the affected computer starts. That ﬁle invokes the second ﬁle, 0.zip, that is a DLL ﬁle with additional code on C2 and how the trojan gets details from the user’s computers. This DLL contains a name in the Chinese language with the following target message for Portugal: “Your group of Portuguese suckers”.Lampion trojan (P-19-2.dll) was sent to the VirusTotal by SI-LAB, and 12 from 71 engines classiﬁed it as malware. This is a clear signal that most of the antivirus engines don’t detect yet the malware signature.Details from the computer’s disk, opened windows, clipboard and banking credentials are gathered and sent to the C2 available on the Internet. The malware only runs if the DLL (inside the 0.zip ﬁle) is available on the same directory where it is executed.urlﬁnance-tax/#.Xh… 2/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxUsers who receive emails this nature should be aware as these ﬁles have a low detection rate and will extract sensitive details including banking credentials from victims’ computers. For Portuguese citizens, special attention on this holiday season as this is an ongoing target campaign.For more details and complete analysis of this malicious campaign see the Technical Analysis below.Technical Analysis Several emails were received by Portuguese users about a new campaign related to the Rendimento de Pessoas Singulares – IRS (annual tax declaration) during the last days of 2019. Two examples can be seen in Figure 1 below.Figure 1: Two template emails used to spread the trojan Lampion.At the ﬁrst glance, just the URLs and their description are different between both templates. The URLs are responsible to download a zip ﬁle that contains three ﬁles described below.Figure 2: URL (1) hosting the malware on the Internet (a zip ﬁle).urlﬁnance-tax/#.Xh… 3/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxFigure 3: URL (2) hosting the malware on the internet (a zip ﬁle). Why Lampion? As observed, the malware icon is a “lampion”, and the original name is “Lampion”. It seems a reference to a Japanese lampion.Figure 4: Malware’s original name and details.Lampion trojan malware – The 1st stageThreat name: FacturaNovembro-4492154-2019-10_8.zip computers.In contrast, ﬁles [1] and [3] are harmless and are only used as a way of inducing the victims to open the VBS document – the Lampion 1st stage.Figure 6: Snippet from the Politica de Protecao de Dados – ST-8 ﬁle, never used during the malware infection chain.On the other hand, the PDF ﬁle [1] is just a PDF ﬁle with some information contained inside, and without malicious links or activity to collect details on the victim’s computer.Figure 7: Object content from FacturaNovembro-4492154-2019-10_8.pdf.Figure 8: Content available on PDF ﬁle FacturaNovembro-4492154-2019-10_8.pdf.urlﬁnance-tax/#.Xh… 5/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxFigure 9: Translation from the Portuguese language to English.The ﬁle states that the ﬁle to be executed is here, in the same directory of the PDF ﬁle . That message is completely conﬁdential, has a unique code, and the date of issuance is highlighted to create a bad feeling on the victim’s side.Threat name: FacturaNovembro-4492154-2019-10_8.vbs (Lampion – 1st stage) downloads the next stage from the Internet and also drops a new VBS ﬁle that will be executed whenever the victim’s computer starts. It looks like an improvement form of the Trojan-Banker.Win32.ChePro family.Figure 10: VirusTotal analysis from FacturaNovembro-4492154-2019-10_8.vbs ﬁle.Looking at the ﬁle, it is obfuscated, but in this case, the technique used by criminals was simple: just add commentaries (junk blocks) between the lines of the malicious code to make it confused.urlﬁnance-tax/#.Xh… 6/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxFigure 11: First stage of the Lampion malware – obfuscated code.After a few rounds of code cleanup (deobfuscation), the ﬁnal code comes up. Before going into the detail, the high-level diagram with the overall behavior of the ﬁle is presented.Figure 12: Lampion 1st stage high-level diagram.In detail, the ﬁrst stage works as described below.It depends on the initial victim’s action. The VBS ﬁle downloads additional ﬁles from the Internet (the 2nd stage – the Lampion itself). 2 ﬁles are downloaded to the AppData Windows folder, and a new VBS ﬁle is also created with the code that will execute the trojan every time the victim’s computer starts. A .lnk ﬁle is created on the Windows StartUp folder to execute the trojan (a persistence technique). Finally, the victim’s computer is forced to reboot and the trojan malware starts its execution.Digging into the details – Lampion 1st stage The 1st stage has random functions to generate random names that will be used to rename the next malicious ﬁles created on the victim’s machine. Line 27 is where the Wscript object is created that will be used to create a .lnk ﬁle on the Windows StartUp folder. All the malware source code is commented on the next images.urlﬁnance-tax/#.Xh… 7/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxFigure 13: Random functions that generate random names – (1/5).The next ﬁgure has the function to decrypt the URLs from which the 2nd stage of malware is downloaded.Figure 14: Decryption function used to decrypt the URLs where the next stage is available – (2/5).Next, all the shortcuts (.lnk) ﬁles are deleted from the operating system StartUp folder (line 65).After that, all the VBS ﬁles from the operating system StartUp folder are also removed to prevent other ﬁles can start with the OS. A randomly named folder is created in the Windows AppData directory that will keep the malicious ﬁles.urlﬁnance-tax/#.Xh… 8/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxFigure 15: Some operations are performed, such as create folders on AppData and setting the default process security level with VBScript – (3/5).Now is time to download the 2nd stage from the Internet. Two ﬁles are obtained from 2 AWS S3 buckets.Figure 16: Trojan 2nd stage is downloaded from two AWS S3 buckets – (4/5).The URLs are encoded with the following strings:1. logs = Decrypt("&aQ^>jhjqfFi`0o%B%~\tkLYya'jL^\[{m[e1hYb~Z!$miU)e$5k3i]#*[OWHi(jc#-(F$bWHcVW\pWe;deW3m$i_$TY%emc^%s&M$Tp^_OfxK")2. ur = Decrypt("{PL^7j\j9f)is0D%9%aiXZ~]E^\i#k*_+ZW^(eU_-ZNe^]5^;i}ZaYm'Y/wYH$6im)6$tksiw#|[dWNi)ja#*(~$oWzc+Wip@e6d2W&m.ix$uYde&ch%{F,#8'9/T#F(]$`ZdbrbY#")urlﬁnance-tax/#.Xh… 9/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxTo get the result of plain-text URLs, SI-LAB is keeping the decryption code available on GitHub. The result is as follows.Figure 17: Clean URLs as a result of the decrypted function output (available here).As observed, the output shows us two AWS-hosted addresses that contain two malicious ﬁles, namely:1. hxxps[:]//fucktheworld.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws[.]com/0.zip 2. hxxps[:]//sdghsuidhoidoghsdc19c.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws[.]com/P-19-2.dllThe 0.zip ﬁle is a DLL with additional code loaded by PE File P-19-2.dll during its execution. It is the PE ﬁle that will be executed each time the infected machine starts. This ﬁle is overly large (32 MB in size), with a lot of trash to make it difﬁcult to detect.Continuing to the last part of the 1st stage, the VBS ﬁle, in the last phase a VBS ﬁle is created in the AppData folder (C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\lkuuxelnxqy.vbs).Also, a .lnk is created in the Windows StartUp folder (C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\lkuuxelnxqy.lnk) which will then execute the next malware stage (P -19-2.dll).urlﬁnance-tax/#.X… 10/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxFigure 18: VBS ﬁle is executed and the operating system is restarted – (5/5).Finally, WScript.Shell runs the created VBScript ﬁle, the victim’s computer is forced to restart, and the malware itself (P-19- 2.dll) runs on the infected machine. Lampion Trojan – 2nd Stage (after the persistence)Threat name: P-19-2.dll an executable.As noted, 12 of 71 AV engines classiﬁed the ﬁle as malware. The ﬁle is extremely large (32 MB), with a lot of junk allowing, thus, to evade antivirus engines as a result.urlﬁnance-tax/#.X… 11/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxThe malware’s protection As explained below, malware is protected by VMProtect 3.x which makes it difﬁcult to analyze even through a manual approach.VMProtect protects code by executing it on a virtual machine with non-standard architecture that makes it extremely difﬁcult to analyze and crack the software. Besides that, VMProtect generates and veriﬁes serial numbers, limits free upgrades and much more.After some rounds, we found that it is protected with the VMProtect 3.x .Figure 20: Lampion protected with the VMProtect 3.x.VMProtect has 3 protection modes: Mutation, Virtualization, and “Ultra” (both methods combined).Mutation does what it says it does: it mutates the assembly code to make automated analysis of it harder. The resulting mutated code varies drastically per compilation. On the other hand, Virtualization translates the code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run. It then inserts a “stub” function to call the VM where the actual code was supposed to be ran.Another detail is two sections identiﬁed in PE File ( vmp0 and vmp1 ), which contains the packed binary code which will later be devirtualized at runtime, and also has the EP (entry point) where the binary will be executed ﬁrst.Note: Details about the VMProtector disassemble will not be displayed in this analysis as it is commercial software for packing and protecting executable ﬁles.urlﬁnance-tax/#.X… 12/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxFigure 21: Malware sections and high entropy of section vmp1.As shown, there are two sections in binary (vmp0 and vmp1) with high entropy that are known as a result of VMProtector. Also, the EP is outside of the standard location. Now it is on: .vmp1.In detail, the malware was developed in Delphi. The IDE Embarcaredo was used to support its developing.Figure 22: Resources from the Lampion trojan malware.As noted from Figure 22, all the source-code logic is available within a feature called TFORM1, a Delphi form.urlﬁnance-tax/#.X… 13/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxFigure 23: Details about Embarcaredo.However, once the malware is protected with VMProtector, it is not possible to decompile the binary source-code. Disassembling – Deep inside By disassembling it, it is possible to get a binary dump by indicating the potential OEP (original entry point). Although part of the binary code remains obfuscated and protected, through this technique, it was possible to get some details about the inner structure of the malware.urlﬁnance-tax/#.X… 14/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxFigure 24: Dumping the binary code, building the binary IAT and get internal details on how it works.The extracted ﬁle has its partial IAT messed up and the name of each function does not appear because its respective virtual addressing is necessary to convert it to a raw addressing. This is a result of the VMProtector 3.x.After the partially unpacked binary, we can see some functions it is using, namely:ShowWindow: Sets the speciﬁed window’s show state. GetWindowTextW: Copies the text of the speciﬁed window’s title bar. IsDialogMessageW: Determines whether a message is intended for the speciﬁed dialog box. GetDesktopWindow: Retrieves a handle to the desktop window. GetCursorPos: Retrieves the position of the mouse cursor, in screen coordinates. GetMenuState: Retrieves the menu ﬂags associated with the speciﬁed menu item. GetKeyboardLayoutNameW: Retrieves the name of the active input locale identiﬁer. OpenClipboard: Opens the clipboard for examination. EnumDisplayMonitors: It enumerates display monitors.urlﬁnance-tax/#.X… 15/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxFigure 25: Functions used to get details about the victim’s computer.During the static analysis, we identiﬁed some functions such as HideFromDebugger and IsDebuggerPresent, and even the library SBIEDLL.DLL which aims to detect if the program is running in a virtual environment.urlﬁnance-tax/#.X… 16/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxLampion – Dynamic Analysis At the moment, the ﬁle 0.zip has not been used (the second one that was downloaded and presented in Figure 16).When the Lampion is running, it will try to read the 0.zip ﬁle from the same directory where it is executing (AppData, in this case).Figure 26: 0.zip ﬁle not found and a popup message is presented. The malware terminates its execution.The 0.zip ﬁle was not found (the second ﬁle downloaded by VBScript). By submitting the executable ﬁle to sandboxes on the Internet, it will never be run derived from this dependency. This can be seen as a mechanism for a dynamic analysis not to be performed properly.By ﬁxing this detail, we can validate that malware actually can read the ﬁle.Figure 27: 0.zip ﬁle is now accessed by Lampion and its content is loaded.The 0.zip ﬁle is a compressed ﬁle with a DLL inside it with additional code. But the ﬁle is protected with a password. Only the 2nd stage (Lampion) has that password inside.urlﬁnance-tax/#.X… 17/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxFigure 28: 0.zip ﬁle protected by a password hardcoded inside the malware 2nd stage (Lampion trojan).This can be seen as yet another anti-reversing mechanism introduced by malware authors.To get details about the library inside the 0.zip ﬁle, we analyzed the 2nd stage and identiﬁed the right moment the ﬁle is unzipped to obtain the password hardcoded from memory (as it is obfuscated).Figure 29: Password of 0.zip ﬁle extracted from memory.After extracting the ﬁles, we can see that its name has Chinese characters. Through the translated message “Your group of Portuguese suckers” we can conclude that this threat is targeting Portuguese citizens.urlﬁnance-tax/#.X… 18/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxFigure 30: Message left by criminals indicating that the threat is targeting Portuguese citizens.Again, this ﬁle is also protected with VMProtector 3.x. This can be observed in Figure 31.Figure 31: 0.zip ﬁle sections.As shown, most of the ﬁle content and EP address are located in the vmp01 section. From Figure 32, we can observe the DLL export address table (EAT).Figure 32: Export Address Table (EAT) from the DLL inside 0.zip.That DLL contains part of the trojan code. Those functions are imported from this DLL. Some of the available functions are:WNetUseConnectionW: It makes a connection to a network resource. WNetGetConnectionW: This function retrieves the name of the network resource associated with a local device. WNetAddConnection2W: This function makes a connection to a network resource and can redirect a local device to the network resource. SHGetFolderPathW: Gets the path of a folder identiﬁed by a CSIDL value. FilterSendMessage: This function sends a message to a kernel- mode miniﬁlter. FilterConnectCommunicationPort: It opens a new connection to a communication server port DoThisBicht: Function invoked when the DLL ﬁle is loaded. CryptUIDIgCertMgr: It is a function that displays a dialog box that allows users to manage certiﬁcates. CallFormPrincipal: It has the source-code logic about keylogger and C2.In detail, we can examine all the malware operations while we open a browser for accessing a home banking website (the malware is activated during the https operation because the certmgr.exe is launched).An interesting detail found on “CallFormPrincipal” is the request method and C2 IP address.1. $_POST=&plug=NAO&sowin=Windows%207%20Home%20Premium%20-%206.1%20-%207601 request to the C2 server available on the Internet.Figure 33: POST request sent to the C2 available online with details about the victim’s computer.Lampion – C2 portal On server C2, a portal is available that we did not have access to, however, it was possible to collect some interesting details.An interesting indicator is that this banking trojan does not have a high detection rate, and can easily run and make persistent on victims’ computers.For example, the URL where the victim data is sent (the POST request) is not identiﬁed as malicious by the antivirus agents at the moment of writing this report.urlﬁnance-tax/#.X… 20/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxFigure 34: C2 server not detected on VirusTotal.As shown, the login page this panel can be accessed and a username and password are required.Figure 35: Login page of C2 panel.Based on some paths available on the server-side, we can ﬁnd that this is a portal already known and shared in the past by David Montenegro along his analysis.Figure 36: Details on the C2 portal (ﬂags that identiﬁed the victim’s origin).Kimberly @StopMalvertisin · 20 de set de 2018 Respondendo a @JayTHL e 3 outros Just saw this now, Win32/ChePro David Montenegro @CryptoInsaneBrazilian Malware Banking urlﬁnance-tax/#.X… 21/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & Tax14:10 - 20 de set de 2018Veja outros Tweets de David MontenegroAs observed, the panel has details about the victim, namely:Country; Date and hour of access; Installed antivirus engine; Version; and Plugin.urlﬁnance-tax/#.X… 22/251/6/2020Targeting Portugal: A new trojan 'Lampion' has spread using template emails from the Portuguese Government Finance & TaxFigure 37: Images about the potential C2 portal.We contacted Amazon Web Services (AWS) to decommission the domains and C2 server before publishing the article, ensuring, thus, that the threat has been contained in a good way and by preserving the victim’s information.
