We discovered the malicious apps victimizing Android users in India, and believe a hacking group—one previously known for victimizing government ofﬁcials—carried out the attacks. We identiﬁed these malicious apps as PoriewSpy (detected by Trend Micro as ANDROIDOS_PORIEWSPY.HRX). We also suspect that the group used malicious apps built using DroidJack or SandroRAT (detected as ANDROIDOS_SANRAT.A), based on similarities in their command-and-control (C&C) server. DroidJack is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that allows intruders to take full control of a user’s Android device when installed. The operators behind these malicious apps might be related to a suspected cyberespionage group discovered in 2016, but it’s possible that the group may be launching different attacks unrelated to their previous campaign. PoriewSpy turns device into an audio recorder, steals other device info Existing as far back as 2014, PoriewSpy steals sensitive information from victims’ devices such as SMS, call logs, contacts, location, and SD card ﬁle list. It can also record victims’ voice calls. The malware was developed from an open-source project called android-swipe-image-viewer, or Android Image Viewer, which the malware operator/s modiﬁed to add the following components: Permissions android.permission.INTERNET android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE Allows applications to access information about networks android.permission.READ_SMS android.permission.READ_LOGS android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS android.permission.READ_CONTACTS android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORA GE android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAG E android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETE DAllows applications to read SMS messages Allows applications to read the low-level system log ﬁles Allows access to the list of accounts in the Accounts Service Allows applications to read the user’s contacts data Allows applications to read the user’s call log.

Permissions added by the malware author/s to the modiﬁed Android Image Viewer added by theServices PoriewSpy apps were automatically downloaded from malicious websites visited by users. When the malicious app is launched, it will initially show nude photos of an Indian actress, but will later hide its icon to obscure itself from users’ sight. When the user calls using an infected device, the malware will start recording the audio, which it saves to /sdcard/.googleplay.security/ named as “_VoiceCall_” + currentTime. It can also turn the mobile device into an audio recorder to timely record audio every 60 seconds even when the user is not having a phone call.malware author/s to the modiﬁedMain espionage component For log collection Audio recordAuto start after device reboot For device power connect action Handle Call actions Handle device network actions Handle Camera related actionsFigure 3.

Code snippet of malware stealing location information from user device through GPS ornetworkIn our research, we also found a malicious app, named after an Indian model-actress, which bears similarities to the code of PoriewSpy apps. Created in 2014, we speculate that this is an earlier version of PoriewSpy that also shares the same C&C server with some of the latest ones. The malicious app is capable of stealing call logs, contacts, SMS, SD card ﬁle list, and audio recording.Figure 9. Left: Conﬁguration code of the seemingly earlier version of PoriewSpy. Right:Conﬁguration code of the latest version of PoriewSpy.Malicious apps developed using DroidJack Apps built using DroidJack also appear to have been used by the hacking group behind PoriewSpy, based on the C&C servers they share. The operators disguised these DroidJack-built apps as freeCall, BatterySavor, Secure_Comm, and Nexus_Compatability. The malicious apps are capable of obtaining all necessary permissions for an Android device’s main functions, including accessing, modifying, and executing calls, SMS, phonebook, camera, audio recorder, as well as enable or disable Wi-Fi connectivity. The C&C servers of PoriewSpy and DroidJack-built apps Some of PoriewSpy’s C&C servers were located at 5[.]189[.]137[.]8 and 5[.]189[.]145[.]248, while some of the DroidJack-built apps’ were at 93[.]104[.]213[.]217 and 88[.]150[.]227[.]71. Our research revealed that these four C&C servers were previously used by a hacking group who allegedly engaged in cyberespionage activities. The abused IPs 5[.]189[.]137[.]8, 5[.]189[.]145[.]248, and 93[.]104[.]213[.]217 can be traced back to a legitimate hosting service provider based in Germany. Meanwhile, 88[.]150[.]227[.]71’s is in the UK. 62[.]4[.]2[.]211, the C&C server of the initial version of PoriewSpy used by some of the latest versions, belongs to a service provider in France. The hacking group also used draagon[.]ddns[.]net, located in South Asia.Figure 10. The chart above shows the connections between the C&C servers of PoriewSpy and DroidJack-built apps, and the suspected cyberespionage group. The green dots represent thecurrent malicious samples. IPs colored in yellow are the ones used by the group in their previouscampaign, while the ones in red are presumably the extension to the mobile platform.The period PoriewSpy and DroidJack-built apps became active also appear to match that of the hacking group’s campaign. It was observed that the activities of the abovementioned mobile malware became active in late 2015 to early 2016, which was around the same period the hacking group’s campaign was also active. Countermeasures Targeted attacks on mobile devices may be few compared to ones for desktops or PCs, but the discovery of PoriewSpy and other malicious apps that spy on the mobile platform should caution users of the threat that may come their way if their devices remain unsecured. Downloading only from legitimate app stores can prevent PoriewSpy and DroidJack-built apps from compromising your mobile device. It is also important to be aware of what apps are allowed to access, and to understand the risks before accepting any terms or granting certain permissions to apps.
