The APT actors were observed compromising Desktop Central servers, dropping a webshell that overrides a legitimate function of Desktop Central, downloading post-exploitation tools, enumerating domain users and groups, conducting network reconnaissance, attempting lateral movement and dumping credentials.CVE-2021-44515, which Zoho rated critical, addresses an authentication bypass vulnerability in ManageEngine Desktop Central software that can allow an adversary to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary code on Desktop Central servers.Zoho released a ManageEngine Desktop Central Security Advisory for the newly identified vulnerability CVE-2021-44515 on December 3, 2021: url bypass-filter-configuration.htmlTLP:WHITETLP:WHITEZoho also provided the following vulnerable build numbers for ManageEngine Desktop Central customers:For Enterprise Customers:For builds 10.1.2127.17 and below, upgrade to 10.1.2127.18For builds 10.1.2128.0 to 10.1.2137.2, upgrade to 10.1.2137.3For MSP Customers:For builds 10.1.2127.17 and below, upgrade to 10.1.2127.18For builds 10.1.2128.0 to 10.1.2137.2, upgrade to 10.1.2137.3Technical Details Initial exploitation of a Desktop Central API URL allowed for an unauthenticated file upload of two different variants of webshells observed in this campaign with the filenames emsaler.zip (variant 1, late October 2021), eco-inflect.jar (variant 1, mid November 2021) and aaa.zip (variant 2, late November 2021).The webshell overrides the legitimate Desktop Central API servlet endpoint,/fos/statuscheck, and filters inbound GET (webshell variant 2) or POST requests (webshell variant 1) to that URL path and executes commands as the SYSTEM user with elevated privileges if the inbound requests pass the filter check.Initial reconnaissance and domain enumeration was conducted through the webshell. After initial reconnaissance, the actors use BITSAdmin to download a likely ShadowPad variant dropper with filename mscoree.dll, and a legitimate Microsoft AppLaunch binary, iop.exe. The dropper is sideloaded through AppLaunch execution, which creates a persistent service to execute the AppLaunch binary moving forward. Upon execution, the dropper creates an instance of svchost and injects code with RAT-like functionality that initiates a connection to a command and control server.Follow-on intrusion activity is then conducted through the RAT, including attempted lateral movement to domain controllers and credential dumping techniques using Mimikatz, comsvcs.dll LSASS process memory dumping, and a WDigest downgrade attack with subsequent LSASS dumping through pwdump.The malicious samples were downloaded from likely compromised ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus servers.IndicatorsTLP:WHITETLP:WHITELog File Analysis1.

Also replace aaa.zip with emsaler.zip, eco-inflect.jar or remove it altogether to expand the search.NOTE: The /fos/statuscheck API URL is a legitimate Desktop Central function, but based on analysis appears to be rarely used, and only expects communications from other internal Desktop Central servers. Any requests between late October 2021 and early December 2021, or those originating from external IP addresses, should be considered suspicious and investigated.Hashes Name: MicrosoftFrameworkLaunchUtilityExecutable Path: C:\ProgramData\MicroSoft Framework\Microsoft.Framework.AppLaunch.exeRAT Path: C:\ProgramData\MicroSoft Framework\mscoree.dllProcessessvchost.exe running MicrosoftFrameworkLaunchUtility ns2.latincop[.]com \ManageEngine\DesktopCentral_Server\lib\aaa.zip\ManageEngine\DesktopCentral_Server\lib\emsaler.zip\ManageEngine\DesktopCentral_Server\lib\eco-inflect.jarC:\windows\ime\ssp.dllC:\windows\ime\iop.exeC:\windows\ime\mscoree.dllC:\ProgramData\MicroSoft Framework\Microsoft.Framework.AppLaunch.exeC:\ProgramData\MicroSoft Framework\mscoree.dllTLP:WHITETLP:WHITETactics, Techniques, and Procedures DLL sideloading  Executing “live off the land” tools, e.g. bitsadmin  Network scanning, e.g. nbtscan, nb.exe  Powershell for command execution  Persistence through Windows Service  Downloading staged post-exploitation tools from other victim infrastructure  Credential dumping, e.g. Mimikatz, comsvcs.dll, WDigest downgrade andpwdumpYara Rules $s1 = { FF 15 ??
