The group tends to attack different companies with a strong focus on the energy and industrial sectors. Companies attacked by Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti are geographically distributed worldwide with a more obvious concentration in Europe and the US. In 2016-2017, the number of attacks on companies in Turkey increased significantly.The main tactics of the group include sending phishing emails with malicious documents and infecting various servers. The group uses some of the infected servers for auxiliary purposes – to host tools and logs. Others are deliberately infected to use them in waterhole attacks in order to reach the group’s main targets.Recent activity of the group against US organizations was discussed in a US-CERT advisory, which linked the actor to the Russian government, as well as an advisory by the UK National Cyber Security Centre.This report by Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT presents information on identified servers that have been infected and used by the group. The report also includes the findings of an analysis of several webservers compromised by the Energetic Bear group during 2016 and in early 2017.With PDFmyURL anyone can convert entire websites to PDF!Attack victims Attack victimsT he table below shows the distribution of compromised servers (based on the language of website content and/or the origins of the company renting the server at the time of compromise) by countries, attacked company types and the role of each server in the overall attack scheme. Victims of the threat actor’s attacks were not limited to industrial companies.T able 1 . Co m pr o m ise d se r ve r s T able 1 .

In this attack type, the attackers’ goal is to extract the following data from the session:user IP, NT LM hash of the user’s password.It should be noted that the image requested using the link is not physically located on the remote server.Scanned resources Scanned resourcesCompromised servers are in some cases used to conduct attacks on other resources. In the process of analyzing infected servers, numerous websites and servers were identified that the attackers had scanned with various tools, such as nmap, dirsearch, sqlmap, etc. (tool descriptions are provided below).T able 2 .

Even though the scanned servers do not necessarily look like potential final victims, it is likely that the attackers scanned different resources to find a server that could be used to establish a foothold for hosting the attackers’ tools and, subsequently, to develop the attack.Part of the sites scanned may have been of interest to the attackers as candidates for hosting waterhole resources.In some cases, the domains scanned were hosted on the same server; sometimes the attackers went through the list of possible domains matching a given IP.In most cases, multiple attempts to compromise a specific target were not identified – with the possible exception of sites on the Bump platform, flight tracker servers and servers of a T urkish hotel chain.Curiously, the sites scanned included a web developer’s website, kashey.ru, and resources links to which were found on this site. T hese may have been links to resources developed by the site’s owner: www.esodedi.ru, www.i-stroy.ru, www.saledoor.ruWith PDFmyURL anyone can convert entire websites to PDF!Toolset used UtilitiesUtilities found on compromised servers are open-source and publicly available on GitHub:Nmap – an open-source utility for analyzing the network and verifying its security. Dirsearch — a simple command-line tool for brute forcing (performing exhaustive searches of) directories and files on websites. Sqlmap — an open-source penetration testing tool, which automates the process of identifying and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities and taking over database servers. Sublist3r — a tool written in Python designed to enumerate website subdomains. T he tool uses open-source intelligence (OSINT ). Sublist3r supports many different search engines, such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu and Ask, as well as such services as Netcraft, Virustotal, T hreatCrowd, DNSdumpster and ReverseDNS. T he tool helps penetration testers to collect information on the subdomains of the domain they are researching. Wpscan — a WordPress vulnerability scanner that uses the blackbox principle, i.e., works without access to the source code. It can be used to scan remote WordPress sites in search of security issues. Impacket — a toolset for working with various network protocols, which is required by SMBT rap. SMBT rap — a tool for logging data received over the SMB protocol (user IP address, user name, domain name, password NT LM hash). Commix — a vulnerability search and command injection and exploitation tool written in Python. Subbrute – a subdomain enumeration tool available for Python and Windows that uses an open name resolver as a proxy and does not send traffic to the target DNS server. PHPMailer – a mail sending tool.In addition, a custom Python script named ftpChecker.py was found on one of the servers. T he script was designed to check FT P hosts from an incoming list.Malicious php ﬁles Malicious php ﬁlesT he following malicious php files were found in different directories in the nginx folder and in a working directory created by the attackers on an infected web servers:With PDFmyURL anyone can convert entire websites to PDF!File nam e File nam eBr ie f Br ie fde scr ipt io n de scr ipt io nT im e o f t he T im e o f t hem d5sum m d5sumlat e st f ile lat e st f ileS iz e , byt e s S iz e , byt e schange (MS K) change (MS K)ini.phpwso shell+ mailmysql.phpwso shell+ mailopts.phpwso shellerror_ log.phpwso shellcode29.phpweb shellproxy87 .phpweb shelltheme.phpwso shellsma.phpPHPMailermedia.phpwso shellf3e3e25a822012 023c6e81b206711865c7 647 0e85b7 f3 8e161ae27 7 531b2e1147 ec514bbdc6dd 8f606f803d39af8883f7 8c31eff38fdb7 2ea3b1800ea917 940f2016-07 -0115:57 :382016-06-1213:35:302016-06-1212:23:282016-06-1210:59:392016-06-1211:10:402016-06-1214:31:132017 -05-1617 :33:022017 -05-1913:53:532017 -04-1715:58:41287 86287 863662336636107 24107 241331041469617 62986In the table above:With PDFmyURL anyone can convert entire websites to PDF!Web shell is a script that allows remote administration of the machine.

Specifically, the following commands for third-party installations were identified on one of the servers:apt install traceroute apt-get install nmapWith PDFmyURL anyone can convert entire websites to PDF!apt-get install screen git clone url the attackers installed any packages and tools for Python they needed.T he diagram below shows times of illegitimate logons to one of the compromised servers during one month. T he attackers checked the smbtrap log file on working days. In most cases, they logged on to the server at roughly the same time of day, probably in the morning hours:Times of illegitimate connections with the server (GMT+3) Times of illegitimate connections with the server (GMT+3)In addition, in the process of performing the analysis, an active process was identified that exploited SQL injection and collected data from a database of one of the victims.With PDFmyURL anyone can convert entire websites to PDF!Conclusion ConclusionT he findings of the analysis of compromised servers and the attackers’ activity on these servers are as follows: 1. With rare exceptions, the group’s members get by with publicly available tools. T he use of publiclyavailable utilities by the group to conduct its attacks renders the task of attack attribution without any additional group ‘markers’ very difficult.2. Potentially, any vulnerable server on the internet is of interest to the attackers when they want toestablish a foothold in order to develop further attacks against target facilities.3. In most cases that we have observed, the group performed tasks related to searching forvulnerabilities, gaining persistence on various hosts, and stealing authentication data.4. T he diversity of victims may indicate the diversity of the attackers’ interests. 5. It can be assumed with some degree of certainty that the group operates in the interests of ortakes orders from customers that are external to it, performing initial data collection, the theft of authentication data and gaining persistence on resources that are suitable for the attack’s further development.Appendix I – Indicators of Compromise Appendix I – Indicators of Compromise Filenames and Paths Filenames and PathsTo o ls* To o ls*/usr/lib/libng/ftpChecker.py /usr/bin/nmap/ /usr/lib/libng/dirsearch/ /usr/share/python2.7 /dirsearch/ /usr/lib/libng/SMBT rap/ /usr/lib/libng/commix/ /usr/lib/libng/subbrute-master/ /usr/share/python2.7 /sqlmap/ /usr/lib/libng/sqlmap-dev/ /usr/lib/libng/wpscan/With PDFmyURL anyone can convert entire websites to PDF!/usr/share/python2.7 /wpscan/ /usr/share/python2.7 /Sublist3r/*Note that these tools can also be used by other threat actors.P HP ﬁles: P HP ﬁles:/usr/share/python2.7 /sma.php /usr/share/python2.7 /theme.php /root/theme.php /usr/lib/libng/media.phpLo gs Lo gs/var/tmp/.pipe.sockPHP ﬁle hashes PHP ﬁle hashesf3e3e25a822012023c6e81b2067 11865 c7 647 0e85b7 f3da46539b40e5c5527 12 155385cc19e30927 65bcfed034b82ccb 1644af9b6424e8f58f39c7 fa5e7 6de51 2292f5db385068e161ae27 7 531b2e114 7 ec514bbdc6dd8f606f803d39af8883f 7 8c31eff38fdb7 2ea3b1800ea917 940fYara rules Yara rulesrule Backdoored_ ssh { $a2 = “usage: ssh” $a3 = “HIST FILE”With PDFmyURL anyone can convert entire websites to PDF!condition: uint32(0) == 0x464c457 f and filesize<1000000 and all of ($a*) }Appendix II – Shell script to check a Appendix II – Shell script to check a server for tools server for tools Shell script for Debian Shell script for Debiancd /tmp workdir=428c5fcf495396df04a459e317 b7 0ca2 find / -type d -iname smbtrap > find-smbtrap.txt 2>/dev/null find / -type d -iname dirsearch > find-dirsearch.txt 2>/dev/null find / -type d -iname nmap > find-nmap.txt 2>/dev/null find / -type d -iname wpscan > find-wpscan.txt 2>/dev/null find / -type d -iname sublist3r > find-sublist3r.txt 2>/dev/null dpkg -l | grep -E \(impacket\|pcapy\|nmap\) > dpkg-grep.txt cp /var/lib/dpkg/info/openssh-server.md5sums . #retrieve initial hash for sshd md5sum /usr/sbin/sshd > sshd.md5sum #calculate actual hash for sshdShell script for Centos Shell script for Centoscd /tmp workdir=428c5fcf495396df04a459e317 b7 0ca2 find / -type d -iname smbtrap > find-smbtrap.txt 2>/dev/null find / -type d -iname dirsearch > find-dirsearch.txt 2>/dev/null find / -type d -iname nmap > find-nmap.txt 2>/dev/null find / -type d -iname wpscan > find-wpscan.txt 2>/dev/nullWith PDFmyURL anyone can convert entire websites to PDF!find / -type d -iname sublist3r > find-sublist3r.txt 2>/dev/null rpm -qa | grep -E \(impacket\|pcapy\|nmap\) > rpm-grep.txt rpm -qa –dump | grep ssh > rpm-qa-dump.txt #retrieve initial hash for sshd sha256sum /usr/sbin/sshd > sshd.sha256sum #calculate actual sha256 hash for sshd md5sum /usr/sbin/sshd > sshd.md5sum #calculate actual md5 hash for sshdEne r ge t ic Be ar /Cr o uching Ye t i: at t acks o n se r ve r s Ene r ge t ic Be ar /Cr o uching Ye t i: at t acks o n se r ve r sAPT CRIMINAL BACKDOOR HACKERS AT T ACKS T ARGET ED AT T ACK VULNERABILIT IES AND EXPLOIT S WAT ERING HOLE AT T ACKSShare post on:  Related Posts Related PostsAPT Trends report Q1 2018Operation Parliament, who is doing what?Masha and these BearsLEAVE A REPLY LEAVE A REPLY Your e mail addre ss will not be publishe d.
