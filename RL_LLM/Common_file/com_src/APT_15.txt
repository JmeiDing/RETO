5/22/2020Intezer - The Evolution of APT15's Codebase 2020The Evolution of APT15’s Codebase 2020intezer.com/blog/research/the-evolution-of-apt15s-codebase-2020May 21, 2020The Ke3chang group, also known as APT15, is an alleged Chinese government-backed cluster of teams known to target various high-proﬁle entities spanning multiple continents. Examples include attacks on European ministries, Indian embassies, and British military contractors. The group’s activities have been traced back to 2010 and it is known to boast a large number of custom tools, most often tailored to their speciﬁc target.In mid May, we identiﬁed three recently uploaded samples from VirusTotal that share code with older APT15 implants. We named this new family of samples, “Ketrum”, due to the merger of features in the documented backdoor families “Ketrican” and “Okrum”.We believe the operation was conducted very recently. Below we present a technical analysis of these samples and explain the evolution of APT15’s codebase over the last year.OVERVIEWThe three samples we discovered seem to be a mix of the Ketrican and Okrum backdoors documented by researchers at ESET in 2019. Features have been merged from these two malware families to create a different RAT class for the group. We’ve decided to call this umbrella of malware “Ketrum.”The new samples we found continue the Ke3chang group’s strategy of using a basic backdoor to gain control over the victim’s device, so that an operator can then connect to it and run commands manually to conduct further operations.Before beginning our technical analysis, we were able to connect these binaries to Ke3chang using Intezer Analyze:url - The Evolution of APT15's Codebase 2020Genetic AnalysisAll three samples contacted the same C2 server and appear to have been used in two different time periods, judging by the PE timestamps and VirusTotal upload date:Name RavAudio64.exe 2019-12-03VirusTotal Date PE Timestamp C27 Jan 2010Family menu.thehuguardian[.]com Ketrum1––2020-05-1613 May 2020www.thehuguardian[.]com Ketrum22020-05-1713 May 2020www.thehuguardian[.]com Ketrum2SHA256s 5de9b7311The C2 was registered towards the end of 2019, which makes us believe the ﬁrst PE timestamp was tampered with, and the latter two timestamps are at least close to the real compilation date.It’s also important to note the C2 was registered in China and ceased operating in mid May.THE BEST OF TWO WORLDSWe documented several interesting differences between the backdoors:Okrum Ketrum1Ketrum canurl - The Evolution of APT15's Codebase 2020Identify installed proxy servers and use them for HTTP requestsSpecial folder retrieval using registry key [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Mi‐ crosoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders]The response from the server is an HTTP page with backdoor commands and argu‐ ments included in the HTML ﬁelds Backdoor commands are determined by a hashing value received from C2Communication with the C&C server is hidden in the Cookie and Set-Cookie headers of HTTP requests Impersonate a logged in user’s security contextCreate a copy of cmd.exe in their working directory and use it to interpret backdoor commands Usual Ke3chang backdoor functionalities – download, upload, execute ﬁles/shell com‐ mands and conﬁgure sleep time Screenshot-grabbing functionalityTable 1KETRUM 1The Ketrum 1 sample was uploaded to VirusTotal in December 2019. This version registers itself as a “WMI Provider Host” service if it is able to obtain SeDebugPrivilege; otherwise it creates an entry in the startup directory.This sample incorporates many features from Okrum as can be seen in the table above, however, it abandons more advanced Okrum features such as offering a reﬂective injection via an export and the use of hashes to receive command IDs.In the past, APT15 has used the IWebBrowser2 COM interface to manage its network communications. This time, the Ketrum developer abandoned this technique and used simple HTTP APIs:Interestingly, this sample also incorporates a screenshot-grabbing command.KETRUM 2Ketrum 2 seems to have been built for minimalism. As can be seen in Table 1, many functionalities have been dropped.Unlike the Ketrican variant, Ketrum implants no longer try to weaken the system’s security conﬁgurations. In previous implants, Powershell was used for this end. Interestingly, a string still remains in Ketrum 2, which refers to this deleted feature—perhaps an unintentional left-over from copy-pasting:Several other interesting unused ﬁle names are included in the binary such as “%s\adult.sft” and “%s\Message”.The malware ﬁrst collects basic system information to track the infected endpoint and then sends it to the C2 server together with a hash of the system info:url - The Evolution of APT15's Codebase 2020All incoming and outcoming payloads are fed through an RC4 encryption and base64 encoding. The RC4 encryption uses an unusual key:These are actually constants used in the MD5 and SHA1 algorithms. The Ketrum developer most likely intended to confuse researchers reversing this function.A command is then extracted from the HTML in the response:This backdoor only supports a limited number of commands, which is typical of Okrum and Ketrican backdoors. Unlike Ketrum 1, Ketrum 2 does not support screenshot grabbing. This is the list of possible backdoor commands:url - The Evolution of APT15's Codebase 2020Description Adjust sleep time Execute a shell command Upload a ﬁle Download a ﬁle Execute a ﬁleCommand ID 7 (there is no 6) Execute a shell command with adjusted sleep time 8 9Adjust execute shell sleep time Download “Notice” ﬁle to working directory – * it is unclear how this is usedCODE REUSEBoth Ketrum samples resemble a similar layout to previous Ke3chang tools, apart from low level implementation and use of system APIs. Even in the two Ketrum samples, there are differences between the low-level APIs used to achieve the same functionality. For example, the ﬁle upload feature is implemented using different APIs throughout the families; mostly using a constant value of 0x20000 when reading ﬁles:Ketrum 1 Ketrum 2url - The Evolution of APT15's Codebase 2020Ketrican 2018OkrumAs reported by FireEye and ESET, it’s likely the Ke3chang cluster of malware is developed by multiple teams and the developers of Ketrican/Okrum belong to a different team than the developers of Ketrum, albeit related. This could explain the high-level and ﬂow similarities but also the low-level differences.CONCLUSIONKe3chang’s numerous tools such as Okrum, Ketrican, TidePool, Mirage, Ketrum, and others all serve the same purpose, give or take a few techniques or functionalities tailored for speciﬁc targets. We can regard these tools under the same umbrella of BS2005 malware, distributed as different versions per operation. However, the distinction created by naming them differently is useful for tracking the group’s operations and different development cycles.The Ke3chang’s group tools have not deviated much from the same tools reported in FireEye’s ﬁrst Ke3chang report. The group continues to morph its code and switch basic functionalities in their various backdoors. This strategy has been working for the group for years and there is no indication yet that it will deviate from this modus operandi.The information security ﬁeld has seen many improvements since the group’s inception, however, surprisingly, this is not 45.56.84[.]25Paul Litvak Paul is a malware analyst and reverse engineer at Intezer.
