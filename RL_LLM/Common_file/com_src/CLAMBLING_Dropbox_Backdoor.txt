During the investigation we found a brand new backdoor sample, which implements lots of features by using Dropbox API, using Dropbox like a C&C server. After the reverse engineering, we extract the Dropbox token used by the sample, dig into Dropbox folder, and reveal the whole functional structure.The report is co-authored with Trend Micro.Kenney Lu, Daniel Lunghi, Cedric Pernet, and Jamz Yaneza. (17 February 2020). Trend Micro. “Operation DRBControl - Uncovering A Cyberespionage Campaign Targeting Gambling Companies In Southeast Asia”First Stage InfectionThe threat actor uses Windows Defender Core Process MsMpEng.exe which has a legal digital signature to load the malicious DLL ﬁle. Load the shellcode from thewww.talent-jump.com/article/2020/02/17/CLAMBLING-A-New-Backdoor-Base-On-Dropbox-en/1/232/18/2020CLAMBLING - A New Backdoor Base On Dropbox (EN) | 詮睿科技payload ﬁle then release the ﬁnal malicious executable to complete the ﬁrst stage infection.During the investigation, we found a total of 8 diﬀerent loader’s ﬁlenames [Appendix 1] renamed from MsMpEng.exe and placed at C:\ProgramData\Microsoft in its separated folder. The loader is just called the function ServiceCrtMain imported from mpsvc.dll.The malicious DLL ﬁle mpsvc.dll has two types . The older type will try to read shellcode from payload ﬁle English.rtf, decode and decompress the content using RtlDecompressBuffer to release the ﬁnal executable (Figure 1).[Appendix 2]Figure 1. Older type of mpsvc.dllThe newer one has a diﬀerent way to start the infection. There is a piece of shellcode hard-coded in the mpsvc.dll, after decoding the shellcode from mpsvc.dll, it will inject and execute to load the shellcode from mpsvc.mui (Figure 2), which will release the ﬁnal executable and inject into the process.www.talent-jump.com/article/2020/02/17/CLAMBLING-A-New-Backdoor-Base-On-Dropbox-en/2/232/18/2020CLAMBLING - A New Backdoor Base On Dropbox (EN) | 詮睿科技Figure 2. Newer type of mpsvc.dllBoth of these two types of mpsvc.dll will release a full functional backdoor, which can connect to the C&C server. But the ﬁnal executable released by a newer type of mpsvc.dll has some upgrade, including the function to interact with Dropbox API. The following article will focus on the malicious executable released by the newer type of mpsvc.dll.The hardcoded shellcode in a newer type of mpsvc.dll will ﬁrst allocate 0x80000 bytes of memory space. Getting the current module’s full path and replace the extension dll to mui and read the shellcode in this mui ﬁle, then jump to the base address of mui ﬁle plus its ﬁrst byte. (Figure 3)www.talent-jump.com/article/2020/02/17/CLAMBLING-A-New-Backdoor-Base-On-Dropbox-en/3/232/18/2020CLAMBLING - A New Backdoor Base On Dropbox (EN) | 詮睿科技Figure 3. Decoded shellcode in mpsvc.dllIn the end, the shellcode in mpsvc.mui has another diﬀerent piece of hard-coded bytes, which will decompress by RtlDecompressBuffer to the ﬁnal malicious executable (Figure 4).www.talent-jump.com/article/2020/02/17/CLAMBLING-A-New-Backdoor-Base-On-Dropbox-en/4/232/18/2020CLAMBLING - A New Backdoor Base On Dropbox (EN) | 詮睿科技Figure 4. The ﬁnal malicious executable in buﬀer.Sample AnalysisThe ﬁnal malicious executable sample we extracted has numerous features. Here is the analysis of some major functions.Bypass UAC, the threat actor only changes the GUID to 9BA94120-7E02-46ee-This sample can bypass UAC via .NET. It is not a new technique which was disclosed in 2017 ADC6-10640B04F93B (Figure 5) and specify the location of DLL ﬁle which will load by the .NET application in the elevated process.[1]www.talent-jump.com/article/2020/02/17/CLAMBLING-A-New-Backdoor-Base-On-Dropbox-en/5/232/18/2020CLAMBLING - A New Backdoor Base On Dropbox (EN) | 詮睿科技Figure 5. Code snippet of bypass UAC.PersistenceThere are two ways to persist. Register as a startup program in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersio n\\Run if it has no privileged (Figure 6). Otherwise, it will register itself as a system service (Figure 7).Figure 6. Register as a start program.www.talent-jump.com/article/2020/02/17/CLAMBLING-A-New-Backdoor-Base-On-Dropbox-en/6/232/18/2020CLAMBLING - A New Backdoor Base On Dropbox (EN) | 詮睿科技Figure 7. Register as a system service.Information GatheringIt will collect some basic information like IP address, hostname, username, OS version and so on. Also, it will search the registry key’s value HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Bitcoin\\Bitcoin-Qt and try to look for the wallet address if exist (Figure 8). All of this information will upload to Dropbox as %Y-%m-%d %H-%M-%S.log, below is a ﬁle sample:Lan IP: x.x.x.x Computer: WIN-XXXXXX UserName: Administrator OS: Win10(X64) Version: 8.0 Bit: Not Found !!! Exist: NOwww.talent-jump.com/article/2020/02/17/CLAMBLING-A-New-Backdoor-Base-On-Dropbox-en/7/232/18/2020CLAMBLING - A New Backdoor Base On Dropbox (EN) | 詮睿科技Figure 8. Code snippet of information gathering.Recording FeaturesThis sample acquired three types of recording features, including key-log, clipboard log, and screen recording. The screen recording ﬁle naming format is [%y-%m-%d] %H-%M-%S.avi. The key-log and clipboard log will encode by diﬀerent key and salt, then save as <hash>.pas for key-log and <hash>.log for clipboard log (Figure 9).www.talent-jump.com/article/2020/02/17/CLAMBLING-A-New-Backdoor-Base-On-Dropbox-en/8/232/18/2020CLAMBLING - A New Backdoor Base On Dropbox (EN) | 詮睿科技Figure 9. Code snippet of key log encoding.Connect to C&C ServerThis sample can also connect to a speciﬁc C&C server and send back data by using a fake HTTP POST request (Figure 10).www.talent-jump.com/article/2020/02/17/CLAMBLING-A-New-Backdoor-Base-On-Dropbox-en/9/232/18/2020CLAMBLING - A New Backdoor Base On Dropbox (EN) | 詮睿科技Figure 10. Code snippet of preparing for fake POST request.RTTI InformationThe RTTI information remaining, here is the full class name list we got:CHPAvi CHPUdpInteract With Dropboxwww.talent-jump.com/article/2020/02/17/CLAMBLING-A-New-Backdoor-Base-On-Dropbox-en/10/232/18/2020CLAMBLING - A New Backdoor Base On Dropbox (EN) | 詮睿科技During reverse engineering, we found that the Dropbox API token with 64 characters is hardcoded in stack string (Figure 11).Figure 11. Code snippet for the ﬁrst 24 characters of Dropbox API token.Besides connecting to the C&C server, this sample can also upload & download with Dropbox API. Especially when the log ﬁle is uploaded, it will try to download bin.asc and check the ﬁle has fake GIF ﬁle header or not. If everything is correct, it will continue to the custom decoding phase, which will calculate with an array of bytes hard-coded in the sample, to release the inject payload (Figure 12).www.talent-jump.com/article/2020/02/17/CLAMBLING-A-New-Backdoor-Base-On-Dropbox-en/11/232/18/2020CLAMBLING - A New Backdoor Base On Dropbox (EN) | 詮睿科技Figure 12. Code snippet of interaction with Dropbox API.Inside of Dropbox FolderAfter we got the Dropbox token, we can now dig into Dropbox by using oﬃcial API, for example, list the account information which creates this token, list the full ﬁle and folder information.In the Dropbox, the folder structure like this:/<unique_hash>/%Y-%m-%d\ %H:%M:%S.log /<unique_hash>/bin.asc /x86bin.ascEach infected victim has its folder named by unique hash /[0-9A-z]/, this hash is generated by machine key and some other information. %Y-%m-%d\ %H:%M:%S.log is the log ﬁle upload by the victim. *.asc is the ﬁle upload by the threat actor. For example, bin.asc is the payload download by the victim when the log ﬁle is upload succeeds.www.talent-jump.com/article/2020/02/17/CLAMBLING-A-New-Backdoor-Base-On-Dropbox-en/12/232/18/2020CLAMBLING - A New Backdoor Base On Dropbox (EN) | 詮睿科技Sort out the log ﬁle on Dropbox, we can get the full list of infected computers (Figure 13).Figure 13. The list of infected computers.Second Stage InfectionAfter the ﬁrst infection stage completed, it will persistent itself as a system service or autorun program. Collecting information and establish a connection to the C&C server. The most interesting part is each time when the log ﬁle is upload succeeds, it will try to download bin.asc from each computer’s unique folder. Most ofwww.talent-jump.com/article/2020/02/17/CLAMBLING-A-New-Backdoor-Base-On-Dropbox-en/13/232/18/2020CLAMBLING - A New Backdoor Base On Dropbox (EN) | 詮睿科技bin.asc we captured is requesting the victim to download x64bin.asc ﬁle from Dropbox.Further analysis of x64bin.asc, we found the second Dropbox API token, its purpose is diﬀerent from the ﬁrst one. Now the threat actor is ready to use Dropbox as another C&C server with the full backdoor feature.The second infection stage’s sample has some bonus features including the ability to interact with Dropbox, the command code mapping show as below:Command Code Action2345678ListDrivesListFilesExecuteFileManageFileUploadFileDownloadFileOpenTerminalIn these commands, there are three diﬀerent ﬁles, each of these ﬁle has speciﬁc ﬁlename and purpose:eLHgZNBH: The status ﬁle, upload to Dropbox at regular intervals. yasHPHFJ: The command ﬁle, containing command and arguments. csaujdnc: The execution result of the command.The status ﬁle eLHgZNBH contain the basic information about victim and timestamp, upload to Dropbox at regular intervals. Whenever status ﬁle upload succeeds, it will try to download the command ﬁle yasHPHFJ if it existed. Extract the command code and arguments from yasHPHFJ then execute the command and upload the execution result to Dropbox as csaujdnc (Figure 14).www.talent-jump.com/article/2020/02/17/CLAMBLING-A-New-Backdoor-Base-On-Dropbox-en/14/232/18/2020CLAMBLING - A New Backdoor Base On Dropbox (EN) | 詮睿科技Figure 14. Flow of three ﬁles interact with DropboxBy using this control ﬂow, the threat actor can use Dropbox as a C&C server to control the victim’s computer even the ﬁxed connection between the speciﬁc C&C server’s IP address has been found and blocked. Unless we block content.dropboxapi.com and api.dropboxapi.com, otherwise we can not isolate the infected computer.The Dropbox API remain the detail of each ﬁle and folder, for example this is a ﬁle information return by Dropbox API:{ '.tag': 'file', 'name': 'Secret_File.txt', 'path_lower': '/secret_file.txt', 'path_display': '/Secret_File.txt', 'id': 'id:<UNIQUE_FILE_ID>', 'client_modified': '2019-07-21T02:45:42Z', 'server_modified': '2019-07-21T02:53:04Z', 'rev': '[0-9a-f]{6,}', }www.talent-jump.com/article/2020/02/17/CLAMBLING-A-New-Backdoor-Base-On-Dropbox-en/15/232/18/2020CLAMBLING - A New Backdoor Base On Dropbox (EN) | 詮睿科技It contains the server_modiﬁed timestamp even with history revision ﬁle id, we can use rev to list the full history of this ﬁle and download it. Sort out this information and the command code mapping, we can now list the full command executed on each computer and its arguments. Here is two computers’ execution list (Figure 15 & 16).Figure 15. Real command execution list from one victim.Figure 16. Another real command execution list.According to these record, the threat actor follows almost the same action on every infected computer. First, download additional attack programs from Dropbox, like mimikatz or other UAC bypass tools. Second, search the high-value ﬁle includingwww.talent-jump.com/article/2020/02/17/CLAMBLING-A-New-Backdoor-Base-On-Dropbox-en/16/232/18/2020CLAMBLING - A New Backdoor Base On Dropbox (EN) | 詮睿科技private source code, conﬁg ﬁle, database, and the key-log / clipboard log. Upload all of these ﬁles to Dropbox for further searching. Last but not least, inﬁltrate the company intranet or even the cloud service.Combining all decoded yasHPHFJ ﬁles, we can show the threat actor’s approximate working hours (Figure 17).Figure 17. The threat actor’s approximate working hours.ConclusionWe start to monitor the Dropbox for each token and parse the infected computer’s list, here we can see the infected computer’s number from July 2019 to September 2019 this two month (Figure 18 & 19).Figure 18. Dropbox A (ﬁrst token): infected computer’s number.www.talent-jump.com/article/2020/02/17/CLAMBLING-A-New-Backdoor-Base-On-Dropbox-en/17/232/18/2020CLAMBLING - A New Backdoor Base On Dropbox (EN) | 詮睿科技Figure 19. Dropbox B (second token): infected computer’s number.We got nearly 200 infected computers at the highest peak from Dropbox A, alone with nearly 80 computers from Dropbox B. Both of these static has a drop at August 21, 2019, the threat actor clear the Dropbox folder for some reason. Monitoring ends on September 20, 2019, all tokens we got are revoked by the threat actor.During these two months, we got ﬁve diﬀerent Dropbox token. Each of these tokens has its purpose. The ﬁrst two tokens are the major one we discuss in this article, others are more like for testing.From the ﬁrst infection stage, established the connection between the C&C server and Dropbox at the same time. If the IP address of the C&C server been blocked, it can still have limited control from Dropbox. Once it completed the second infection stage, Dropbox is turning into a second channel C&C server which has full remote control features (Figure 20). Steal the data and inﬁltrate the whole company.
