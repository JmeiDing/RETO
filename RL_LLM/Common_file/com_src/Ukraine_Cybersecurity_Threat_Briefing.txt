Among the most striking features of this attack were the complexity of organization and planning, the discipline in execution, and capability in many of the discrete tasks exhibited by the threat actors. Over the course of nearly a year prior to the attack, these unknown actors clandestinely established persistent access to multiple industrial networks, identified targets, and ultimately carried out a complex set of actions, which not only disrupted electricity distribution in Ukraine, but also destroyed IT systems, flooded call centers, sowed confusion, and inhibited incident response. The attackers used a malware tool, BlackEnergy 3, designed to enable unauthorized network access, then used valid user credentials to move laterally across internal systems, and ultimately shut down electricity distribution using the utilities’ native control systems. This report details the step-by-step process the actors took and seeks to highlight the opportuni- ties for detection and prevention across the various steps of the attack. Combining open- source intelligence analysis of the attack and malware analysis of the tools used by the threat actors in their operation, we break down the integration of both human interaction and malware-executed processes as components of the December 2015 events. This Booz Allen report expands on previous incident analysis published in spring 2016, going beyond by including additional detail about the attack chain based on malware execution, a more detailed mapping of targeted and affected infrastructure, and a much wider view on similar and potentially related Black Energy (BE) campaigns against Ukrainian infrastructure. This report provides a highly accessible and factual account of the incident. By providing this comprehensive view of the events, this report provides operators, plant managers, chief information security officers, and key industrial security decision makers a view of how an attack could be conducted against their networks and infrastructure, and—more importantly—some advice on how to mitigate attacks such as these in the future. This attack was exceptionally well organized and executed, but the tools necessary to mitigate and minimize the impact of an attack such as this are not difficult to implement. By implementing a well-designed defense-in-depth protection strategy, industrial network and ICS/SCADA defenders can effectively address the threats facing their organizations. This report highlights the important components this strategy ought to include, based on the methods used in the Ukraine attack. E X E C U T I V E S U M M A R Y a. Despite early reporting indicating that disruptions in Brazil’s electrical grid in 2007 were the result of a cyberattack, further investigation ultimately attributed the blackouts to inadequate maintenance. www.boozallen.com/ICS 1 Shortly before sunset on December 23, 2015, hackers remotely logged into workstations at a power distribution company in western Ukraine, clicked through commands in the operators control system interface, and opened breakers across the electrical grid one by one. Before they were finished, they struck two more energy distribution compa- nies, in rapid succession, plunging thousands of businesses and households into the cold and growing darkness for the next six hours. attacks were not isolated incidents, but the culmination of a yearlong campaign against a wide range of Ukrainian critical infrastructure operations. In addition to three energy distribution companies, threat actors had also previously targeted several other critical infrastruc- ture sectors, including government, broadcast media, railway, and mining operators. The attacks in Ukraine were a watershed moment for cybersecurity; for the first time, malicious cyber threat actors had successfully and publicly disrupted energy-grid operations, causing blackouts across multiple cities. The power outage was also one of the few known cyber- attacks against a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, a type of system critical to automation in many sectors, including transportation, manufacturing, heavy industry, and oil and gas. This report details the actions threat actors took in each step of the attack, including an analysis of associated malware and other identified indicators of compromise (IoC). This report also includes, as an appendix, detailed technical analysis of the associated malware’s function and use. By tracing this attack from early exploration and target identification to turning the lights out on Ukrainian cities, this report serves as an aid to the security professionals charged with securing industrial control systems (ICS) and is equally relevant across a range of other critical infrastructure sectors. By understanding the current tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) that the threat actors used in this attack, and those that are most likely to be used against ICS systems in the future, security professionals can use this case study to plan for future threats against their own systems. Though this attack targeted operators in the electricity distribution sector, the TTPs illustrated in this attack are applicable to nearly all ICS sectors including oil and gas, manufacturing, and transportation. A reconnaissance campaign against US ICS operators in 2011–2014 using the same malware family deployed across Ukraine’s critical infrastructure raises the urgency of understanding this disruptive Ukrainian attack. ADDRESSING THE THREAT In a series of unique, discrete steps, the threat actors deployed malware; gained access to targeted corporate networks; stole valid credentials; moved into the operators’ control environment; identified specific targets; and remotely disrupted the power supply. Each task was a missed opportunity for defenders to block, frustrate, or discover the attackers’ operations before they reached their final objectives. The Ukraine incident also demonstrates that no single mitigation can prevent an attack’s success. The attackers followed multiple avenues to eventually overcome challenges and move onto the attack sequence’s next components. The most effective strategy for repelling complex attacks, therefore, is defense in depth. Layering defenses can raise the adversary’s cost of conducting attacks, increase the likelihood of detection by a network defender, and prevent a single point of failure. All mitigation techniques, from I N T R O D U C T I O N This attack on Ukraine’s electric grid is the most damaging of the increas- ingly common attacks against ICS systems. ICS operators reported more security incidents in 2015 than in any other year. Complementing the detailed, procedural analysis provided in this report, Booz Allen’s Industrial Security Threat Briefing provides a broader perspective on the cyber threat landscape ICS operators face. The Industrial Security Threat Briefing includes an overview of the emerging tactics and active threat actors observed in 2015 and 2016, as well as the threats most likely to affect ICS operators in the coming years. The report is available at url insights/2016/06/industrial- cybersecurity-threat-briefing. www.boozallen.com/ICS 3 architectural segmentation and network moni- toring, to access control and threat intelligence, should be complementary efforts in a wide- reaching process and network defense strategy that aims to protect the environment, making it so difficult, expensive, or time consuming that it ultimately deters the attacker. OUR RESEARCH METHODOLOGY Though the attacks against Ukraine’s electrical grid in December 2015 have been discussed widely in public reporting, this report seeks to build upon the analysis to provide a more comprehensive account. By analyzing the malware tools used in the attack and using open-source intelligence gathering, this report seeks to tie together the wide body of existing information on this event and fill the gaps in other reports. This report leverages an extensive analysis of publicly reported data on the attack, as well as our own deep-dive technical analysis of recovered malware samples used in the attack. Public reporting on the incident and related attack data was collected manually or through automated searches on publicly accessible internet sites. The sources included, but were not limited to, English and foreign language media, advisories and alerts from US and foreign government cybersecurity organizations, and analysis by independent security researchers. References to IoCs and other attack data were used to identify related incidents, then analyze and integrate their findings with this attack. Analysis of public reporting was complemented with a thorough technical analysis of recovered malware samples used in the December 2015 attacks against the electrical distributors, as well as samples from related attacks. Our technical analysis was used to verify, corroborate, and expand on existing reports detailing threat actor activity leading up to and during the incident. Experienced reverse engineers used disassembler and debugger software to navigate through the malware code to identify its capabilities and unique characteristics. Reverse engineers used both static and dynamic analysis, allowing them to see how the malware behaves on a system with the freedom to run in a debugger in order to force or bypass certain conditions, thereby allowing the malware to take multiple paths. By recording system changes made by the malware, the reverse engineers were able to gather key data needed to identify further system infections, as well as potential mitigations. This investigation also emphasized analyzing the recovered samples within the context of their broader malware family. Using YARA, a tool to identify binary or textual signatures within malware, analysts pivoted to new samples in an effort to identify new capabilities and different variants of the malware. This comprehensive report completes the view of the attack sequence for this incident. Acknowledgments Several in-depth reports have been released, each covering a different facet of the December 2015 attacks in Ukraine. The SANS Institute, in partnership with the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (E-ISAC), 6 as well as the US Department of Homeland Security’s National Cybersecurity and Communi- cations Integration Center (NCCIC) have both produced detailed reports covering the incident. Security researchers at F-Secure have conducted extensive analysis of the BlackEnergy malware, and reporting produced by Cys-Centrum 10 and Trend Micro 11 have sought to lay out the common ties across the string of similar, and likely related, cyber attacks against Ukrainian critical infrastructure. Each of these accounts provides a different piece of the larger picture, which this report lays out. 4 Booz Allen Hamilton Our research and analysis of the December 2015 blackout showed that the attack against Ukraine’s electricity grid was not an isolated incident, but in fact a continuation of a theme of a steady, deliberate attacks against Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. This long-running campaign likely reflects a significant, concerted effort by a single threat actor with a well-organized capability and interest in using cyberattacks to undermine Ukraine’s socio-political fabric. Each of the attacks used a common set of TTPs that had been used in earlier incidents in the previous months, detailed in Exhibit 1. To put the December 2015 attack in context, our research uncovered an additional 10 related attacks, the last of which occurred in January 2016. Exhibit 1 shows the timing, tech- niques and target sectors in this 18-month campaign.

May 2014 (Electricity) On May 12, 2014, threat actors targeted Ukrainian electricity distributor Prykarpattyaoblenergo in a phishing campaign using weaponized Microsoft (MS) Word documents. 12 The threat actors forged the sender addresses and modified the weaponized MS Word attachments with a malicious PE-executable file inserted into the icon image associated with file. 13 2. May 2014 (Railway) On May 12, 2014, threat actors targeted all six of Ukraine’s state railway transporta- tion system operators in a phishing campaign using weaponized MS Word documents. actors forged the sender addresses and modified the weaponized MS Word attachments with a malicious PE-executable file inserted into the icon image associated with file. 15 3. August 2014 (Ukrainian Regional Government, Archives) In August 2014, threat actors began a wide-reaching phishing campaign using weaponized MS Power Point files. The weaponized files exploited a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2014-4114) to deliver BlackEnergy Malware to targeted systems. 16,17 Targets included five Ukrainian regional govern- ments, and the state archive of Chernivtsi Oblast, one of the three oblasts targeted in the December 2015 Electricity distributor attacks. 18,19 4. March 2015 (Media) In early March 2015, threat actors conducted a phishing campaign against Ukrainian television broadcasters, using weaponized MS Excel and MS PowerPoint documents (Додаток1.xls and Додаток2.pps). ized documents contained malicious Visual Basic Application (VBA) and JAR files designed to drop BlackEnergy malware on targeted systems. 21 5. March 2015 (Electricity) In late March 2015, threat actors conducted a phishing campaign targeting electricity operators in western Ukraine using the weaponized MS Excel file (Додаток1.xls) used earlier that month against broadcast media targets. As with the earlier attack, the file included a malicious macro designed to install BlackEnergy. 22 6. March 2015 (State Archives) Also in late March 2015, threat actors targeted Ukrainian state archives in phishing attacks using the same weaponized MS Excel file (Додаток1.xls), malicious macro, and 7. October 2015 (Television Broadcast) On October 24 and October 25, 2015, Ukrainian election day, threat actors used KillDisk malware to destroy video data and server hardware, and render employee workstations inoperable at multiple Ukrainian Targeted systems were found to be infected with the same BlackEnergy and KillDisk samples observed in attacks against a railway operator, mining company, and electricity distributors in November and December 2015. Investigation of the incident indicated access to the network was established May 2015. 26 8. November–December (Railway) In November– December 2015, an undisclosed Ukrainian Railway firm, operating under the Ukrainian State Administration of Railway Transport, was targeted in a cyberattack using BlackEnergy and KillDisk The method for establishing initial access to targeted networks was not disclosed. 9. November–December 2015 (Mining) In November–December 2015, an undisclosed Ukrainian Mining firm was targeted in a cyberattack using BlackEnergy and KillDisk malware. method for establishing initial access to targeted networks was not disclosed. 10. December 2015 (Electricity) On December 23, 2015, threat actors opened breakers and disrupted electricity distribution at three Ukrainian firms: Prykarpattyaoblenergo, Kyivoblenergo, and Chernivtsioblenergo. Full details of this attack are included in the Attack Walk Through section of this report. 11. January 2016 (Electricity) On January 19 and 20, 2016, threat actors targeted approximately 100 organizations, including many Ukrainian energy in a phishing campaign. emails were designed to look as though they were sent by Ukrainian energy distributor NEC Ukrenergo. 31 The emails included a weaponized MS Excel document, which prompted users to enable macros; once enabled, a malicious VBA script installed GCat, an open-source, python-based trojan which disguises communications with the command-and-control (CC) server as Gmail email traffic. BlackEnergy is a remote-access trojan designed to provide unauthorized access to targeted networks via an HTTP connection with an external server. Its modular design allows it to accept additional plugins to carry out specific functions, such as stealing credentials or conducting network reconnaissance. www.boozallen.com/ICS 7 Though the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) immediately implicated Russia in the attack, 33 there is no smoking gun which irrefutably connects the December 2015 attacks in Ukraine to a specific threat actor. The limited technical attribution data, such as the attackers using a Russia-based Internet provider and launching the telephony denial-of-service (TDoS) flood traffic from inside Russia, 34 point to Russian threat actors, though this evidence is not conclusive unto itself. Some inferences can be made based on the history of the tools used, how the attack was carried out, and the outcomes that were achieved. Cybercriminal organizations and state-backed groups are often the most well- resourced, organized, and technically advanced cyber threat actors. BlackEnergy first emerged as a DDoS tool in 2007 35 and has a history of use by criminal organizations. The most notable criminal operation was a series of attacks in 2011 against Russian and Ukrainian banks, in which criminals used BlackEnergy 2 to steal online credentials and obfuscate the attacks with distributed deni- al-of-service (DDoS) floods. 36 Despite these criminal roots, BlackEnergy often rears its head in attacks with particular political significance, typically targeting organizations and countries with adversarial relations with Russia. In 2008, during Russia’s conflict with Georgia, Georgian networks were bombarded with a DDoS attack by a botnet constructed with the first iteration of BlackEnergy, and controlled by CC servers hosted on Russian state-owned compa- BlackEnergy was also used in June 2014, targeting a French telecommunications firm, by a group known to conduct cyberattacks against NATO, Western European governments, and several regional Ukrainian governments. 39,40,b In addition, the KillDisk malware, used in conjunction with BlackEnergy, was first observed in a data destruction attack against servers operated by several Ukrainian news outlets on October 24–25, 2015, Ukraine’s election day. 41 As security researchers have pointed out, the overlap in usage of the malware by multiple groups, including criminal organizations, would be convenient for a state-backed group as this provides a degree of plausible deniability. noted above though, the targets selected in previous campaigns using BlackEnergy often align to Russian political interests. Furthermore, the activity associated with the December 2015 attack does not appear to align to a criminal organiza- tion’s likely goal of financial gain. Threat actors invested significant resources in establishing, maintaining, and expanding persistent access on targeted networks for nearly a year. They conducted extensive network reconnaissance, likely developed malicious firmware, familiarized themselves with the native control environment, and then ultimately revealed their presence in a destructive attack. The extensive resources invested, and no apparent financial return, indicate the attackers’ likely objective was to use the attack to send a message. b. Reporting did not specify whether if used BlackEnergy malware was used in the attacks against NATO or other European govern- ment targets. 8 Booz Allen Hamilton Several plausible theories that have been proposed may explain the threat actor’s motiva- tions for conducting the attacks, as well as its timing, target, and impact. It is possible that the adversary was motivated by several of the posited theories, though the attack was probably designed to send a message to the Ukrainian government, rather than gain a lasting benefit. CONVEY DISPLEASURE WITH PLANS TO NATIONALIZE RUSSIAN-OWNED ASSETS One theory that has circulated in cybersecurity circles is that the attackers may have intended to convey displeasure with a Ukrainian proposal 43,44 to nationalize assets owned by Russia and its The policy would have harmed influential Russian oligarchs with investments in Ukraine’s energy sector. For example, Alexander Babakov—a senior member of Russia’s national legislature and a current target of EU sanc- —is a main shareholder in VS Energy. It is one of the largest electricity distributors in the Ukrainian market, with ownership stakes in nine of the 27 oblenergos and a 19-percent electricity- distribution market share, as of 2010. 47 Based on available evidence, however, we find the theory unconvincing. The timing of the attack and the particular target made it an unlikely symbolic target for expressing a position on nationalization. Discussions about nationalizing Russian assets had not been a headline issue since the spring of 2015, more than six months before the disruption; the lack of temporal proximity between the two events blurred or watered down the symbolic value of the attack vis-à-vis nationalization. POLITICAL DESTABILIZATION; CULTIVATE GENERAL FEAR AND DISCONTENT Another possible objective was to destabilize Ukraine politically. As indicated above, a wide swath of Ukrainian organizations were caught in the attacker’s larger collection of networks compromised with BlackEnergy, including targets in the railway, mining, broadcast media and This trend indicates the objective may have been to disrupt a critical service provider or critical industry, rather than an energy company specifically. By disrupting operations in critical infrastructure, the threat actors may have sought to reduce confidence in the Ukrainian government. This strategy would be consistent with Russia’s information warfare doctrine, which seeks to sow discontent in a target country or region in order to induce political and boozallen.com/ics 9 IN-KIND RETALIATION Another possible objective may have been in-kind retaliation for perceived Ukrainian disruptions of electricity to Crimea. On November 21–22, 2015, Crimea lost power for more than six hours due to physical attacks on four pylons carrying transmis- The identity of the saboteurs has not been publicly determined, but they are rumored to be Ukrainian nationalists. 51 Crimea is reliant on Ukraine, as the country supplies about 70 percent of Crimea’s power. 52 Russia intends to obviate this risky reliance by constructing a new energy bridge between Crimea and Russia, which will be able to supply 70–80 percent of Crimea’s power needs. 53 If this was the objective in the attack, it would indicate that Russia may actively seek to gain footholds in critical services providers with the intention to execute attacks at strategically useful times. This would be consistent with similar attacks against critical infrastructure in other adversarial nations in Western Europe that have been attributed to Russia. OUTLOOK While politically motivated cyberattacks are not a novel foreign policy tool, the industries and organizations that serve as potential targets are expanding. Cyberattacks present a powerful political tool, particularly those against critical infrastructure providers. Industrial control systems operators are not above the fray in geopolitical rows, and may in fact be the new primary target. 10 Booz Allen Hamilton The attack walk through provided in this report is informed by analytical frameworks published by cybersecurity industry organizations, as proprietary methods for conducting open- source intelligence analysis and technical malware analysis. To provide as complete a picture as possible for this report, as with other reporting on this incident, some inferences on the threat actors’ most likely method were required, as there does not exist a complete accounting of all actions the threat actors took in their campaign. Wherever possible, inferences were based on confirmed technical evidence, such as identified malware capabilities and known hardware and software vulnerabilities. This section provides the step-by-step walk through of threat actor activity during the attack. Each step includes a high-level description, as well as a feature summary of the step with eight descriptors. The eight descriptors are as follows: Location: This describes the network on which the activity occurred, including preparatory activity conducted outside of the targeted networks (listed as “external infrastructure”), as well as the logically or physically separated “corporate network” or “ICS network” operated by the electricity distributors. Action: The December 2015 attacks were achieved using a combination of direct threat actor manipu- lation of systems deployed by the electricity distributors, as well as malware-executed tasks. “Active threat actor activity” highlights tasks that involved hands-on-keyboard interactions with systems deployed on the electricity distributor network. “Malware execution” highlights tasks completed by functions built into the malware tools used by threat actors. c Timeline: This section provides the timeframe in which the step most likely occurred. This includes specific, known dates, as well as ranges of time defined by known threat actor activities. Device/application: This section lists the device or application targeted or exploited by threat actors in the step. Wherever possible, specific model information is provided; in instances in which the model or application details were not found in open sources, analysts made assessments based on available evidence, such as operating system (OS) or application-specific services targeted by the reported malware. For the steps detailing prepara- tory tasks conducted external to the electricity distributors’ networks, “activity conducted external to network” is listed rather than the targeted device or application. Role in infrastructure: This section details the function of the targeted device or application within the electricity distributors’ network. “Activity conducted external to network” is listed for preparatory activities conducted on external infrastructure. Exploitation method: This section includes a summary of the method used by threat actors to complete the step. Impact: This section includes a brief summary of the capability achieved by threat actors, or any disruption or destruction of systems operated by the targeted operator, upon completion of the step. Booz Allen’s recommended mitigations: This section provides the technical or procedural security measures that would help prevent or limit the impact of the activities associated with the step. AT TA C K WA L K T H R O U G H c. One step required employees to actively grant permissions that enabled the malware to execute. Another step manipulated a task scheduling service available on the targeted network. boozallen.com/ics 11 Steps 1–9 Step 1: Reconnaissance and Intelligence Gathering. Prior to the attack, threat actors likely begin open-source intelligence gathering and reconnaissance on potential targets. Step 2: Malware Development and Weaponization. Threat actors acquire or independently develop the malware to be used in the attack, as well as the weaponized documents to deliver the malicious files. Step 3: Deliver Remote Access Trojan (RAT). Threat actors initiate phishing campaign against electricity distributors. Step 4: Install RAT. Threat actors successfully install BlackEnergy 3 on each of the three targeted electricity distributors after employees open the weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros. Step 5: Establish Command-and-Control (CC) Connection. Malware establishes connection from malicious implant on targeted network to attacker-controlled command-and-control (CC) server. Step 6: Deliver Malware Plugins Following installation of BlackEnergy 3 implant, threat actors likely import plugins to enable credential harvesting and internal network reconnaissance. Step 7: Harvest Credentials. Delivered BE3 malware plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery functions. Step 8: Lateral Movement and Target Identification on Corporate Network. Threat actors conduct internal reconnaissance on corporate network to discover potential targets and expand Step 9: Lateral Movement and Target Identification on ICS network. Threat actors use stolen credentials to access the control environment and conduct reconnaissance on deployed EXHIBIT 2. WALK THROUGH OF THREAT ACTOR ACTIVITY, STEPS 1 THROUGH 9 d. In this step, the threat actors are not passing through the Domain Controller server in their lateral movements across the network, as they would, for example, a VPN gateway. In accessing the Domain Controller they are retrieving, or making, valid user credentials to enable expansive access across the corporate network and pivoting into the ICS network. The actual movement and network exploration would follow this compromise, would be conducted using the stolen credentials, and would occur on many machines across the network. 12 Booz Allen Hamilton In addition to the high-level summary of each step provided in this section, each step has a corre- sponding textual summary provided in Appendix A. This textual summary provides the detailed overview of the evidence relating to each step, including citations for all referenced material and explanations of analyst assessments. RECONNAISSANCE STEP 1: RECONNAISSANCE AND INTELLIGENCE GATHERING Prior to the attack, threat actors likely begin open-source intelligence gathering and reconnais- sance on potential targets. Location: External infrastructure Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: May 2014 or earlier Device/application: Activity conducted external to network Role in infrastructure: Activity conducted external to network Exploitation method: Threat actors likely gather publicly available information on deployed systems and network architecture, and may also use active discovery methods such as scanning of perimeter devices. Impact: Threat actors gather targeting data on personnel and network infrastructure for use in future attacks. Booz Allen’s recommended mitigations: • Implement information classification program to categorize critical system information that could be used by a threat actor. Sensitive information such as this should have restricted distribution and not be publicly available. • Utilize open-source intelligence gathering to identify publicly accessible information on the organization or personnel that could be used by threat actors in social engineering attacks. • Utilize open-source tools, such as Shodan, to monitor your organization’s external IP address range for unexpected Internet-facing devices. Pay special attention to identified devices with common ICS ports, such as Modbus (502) or EtherNet/IP (44818). • Maintain a detailed inventory of all assets and communication paths to develop an under- standing of potential external attack vectors. Asset inventories should cover both equipment and applications, and should include such details as MAC ID, IP address, and firmware version, to prevent rogue network connections or modifications to network devices. • Actively monitor perimeter network security devices to identify active reconnaissance techniques, such as port scanning. WEAPONIZATION STEP 2: MALWARE DEVELOPMENT AND WEAPONIZATION Threat actors acquire or independently develop the malware to be used in the attack, as well as the weaponized documents to deliver the malicious files. Location: External infrastructure Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: May 2014 or earlier Device/application: Activity conducted external to network Role in infrastructure: Activity conducted external to network Exploitation method: Threat actors acquire BlackEnergy remote access trojan (RAT), and weaponize Microsoft (MS) Word and Excel files with VBA scripts to drop the BlackEnergy RAT. Impact: Combined with targeting data gathered during the reconnaissance phase, threat actors are able to develop tailored attack packages. At the completion of this step, threat actors have all the necessary tools to begin their attack. boozallen.com/ics 13 Booz Allen’s recommended mitigation: • Implement application whitelisting to prevent unknown files from being executed and apply sandboxing to non-critical applications in order to reduce unintended modifications. DELIVERY STEP 3: DELIVER RAT Threat actors initiate phishing campaign against electricity distributors. Location: Corporate network Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: May 2014–June 2015 e Device/application: Employee workstations, likely using MS Windows OS and provisioned with MS Internet Explorer web browser Role in infrastructure: Support email communica- tions and other IT services used in business operations. Exploitation method: Threat actors send innocu- ous-looking emails containing the modified MS Office files as attachments to users on targeted networks. This tactic is known as phishing. Impact: RAT is delivered to targeted network, but not installed. Installation requires employees to actively grant permission to the embedded VBA scripts to execute. Booz Allen’s recommended mitigations: • Implement a position-specific cyber- security awareness training program to ensure employees understand the organizational risks associated with cyberattacks and how to identify social engineering techniques such as phishing. • Establish a Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT) and ensure all employees are aware that suspicious emails or attachments should be forwarded here for investigation. The CIRT should review any reports, perform malware analysis, and extract an indicator of compro- mise (IOC) to identify any infections on the organization’s network. • Use a network-based antivirus solution to detect and prevent known malware from entering the organization’s network. • Install and configure an anti-spam solution to screen incoming emails for suspicious content or abnormal senders. • Subscribe to and monitor threat intelligence sources to be aware of ongoing campaigns. This information can be used to focus defense efforts and search for IOCs. EXPLOITATION AND INSTALLATION STEP 4: INSTALL RAT Threat actors successfully install BlackEnergy 3 on each of the three targeted electricity distributors after employees open the weaponized MS Office email attachments and enable macros. Location: Corporate network Action: Employee-enabled malware execution Timeline: May 2014–June 2015 Device/application: Employee workstations, likely using MS Windows OS and provisioned with MS Internet Explorer web browser Role in infrastructure: Support email communica- tions and other services used in business operations. Exploitation method: In a social engineering attack, employees are prompted to enable macros when opening the file attached to phishing email. Once macros are enabled, the VBA script places multiple malicious files on the workstation, unbeknown to the employee. Impact: Files placed on workstations within the corporate network can begin the communication process with external CC servers. e. Ukrainian Deputy Energy Minister noted access was gained at least six months prior to the final attack. Earliest observed phishing attack matching TTP against electricity distributor was May 2014. 14 Booz Allen Hamilton Booz Allen’s recommended mitigations: • Implement application whitelisting to prevent unknown files from being executed. • Use host-based antivirus software to detect and prevent known malware from infecting organization systems. • Set script execution policy to allow only signed VBA scripts and macros to be run. COMMAND AND CONTROL STEP 5: ESTABLISH CC CONNECTION Malware establishes connection from malicious implant on targeted network to attacker-controlled CC server. Location: Corporate network Action: Malware execution Timeline: May 2014–June 2015 Device/application: Employee workstations, likely using MS Windows OS and provisioned with MS Internet Explorer web browser Role in infrastructure: Support email communica- tions and other services used in business operations. Exploitation method: The external connection is established as part of the execution routine following installation of the malicious files. Once permissions to execute macros are granted by employees, the malicious VBA script installs the malware implant, and the implant attempts to communicate with an external server via HTTP requests. Impact: Threat actors gain unauthorized access to targeted networks, including the ability to deliver additional BlackEnergy plugins to enable internal network reconnaissance and credential harvesting. Booz Allen’s recommended mitigations: • Configure firewall ingress and egress traffic filtering to block anomalous incoming and outgoing network communications. • Blacklist known malicious IP addresses and monitor for any form of network communica- tions to these addresses. ACTION ON OBJECTIVES: INTERNAL RECONNAISSANCE AND LATERAL MOVEMENT STEP 6: DELIVER MALWARE PLUGINS Following installation of BlackEnergy 3 implant, threat actors likely import plugins to enable credential harvesting and internal network reconnaissance. Location: Corporate network Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: June 2015–December 2015 Device/application: Employee workstations, likely using MS Windows OS and provisioned with MS Internet Explorer web browser Role in infrastructure: Support email communications and other services used in business operations Exploitation method: The BlackEnergy 3 implant delivered in the initial attack functions as a receiver for additional malware plugins. After establishing a remote connection with delivered files via HTTPS, the threat likely delivers the additional malware components. Impact: The delivered plugins enable additional BlackEnergy functionality, including harvesting user credentials, keylogging, and network reconnaissance. boozallen.com/ics 15 Booz Allen’s recommended mitigations: • Implement application whitelisting to prevent unknown files from being executed. • Configure firewall ingress and egress traffic filtering to block anomalous incoming and outgoing network communications. • Blacklist known malicious IP addresses and monitor for any form of network communica- tions to these addresses. • Use host-based antivirus software to detect and prevent known malware from infecting organization systems. STEP 7: HARVEST CREDENTIALS Delivered BlackEnergy 3 malware plugins conduct credential harvesting and network discovery functions. Location: Corporate network Action: Active threat actor activity, malware execution Timeline: June 2015–December 2015 Device/application: Windows OS workstations, Windows domain controllers, virtual private network (VPN) service deployed in control environment Role in infrastructure: These systems support business operations, manage permissions and domain access, and provide remote network access respectively. Exploitation method: Threat actors use delivered BlackEnergy 3 plugins to gather stored credentials or log keystrokes. After gathering valid credentials for user with administrator privileges, threat actors use the stolen administrator credentials to access the domain controller, recover additional creden- tials, and create new privileged accounts. Impact: Threat actors obtain valid credentials enabling them to expand access across the corporate network and into the control environment, ensure persistent access, and blend into regular network traffic. Booz Allen’s recommended mitigations: • Implement centralized logging and monitor audit logs for unusual logins or use of adminis- trative privileges (e.g., abnormal hours, unsuccessful login attempts). • Establish a baseline of user domain and local accounts and monitor for any account additions or privilege escalations outside of the organization’s approved workflow. • Implement least privilege policies across all systems to ensure administrative accounts are properly restricted and assigned to only those who require them. STEP 8: LATERAL MOVEMENT AND TARGET IDENTIFICATION ON CORPORATE NETWORK Threat actors conduct internal reconnaissance on the corporate network to discover potential targets and expand access. Location: Corporate network Action: Active threat actor activity, malware execution Timeline: June 2015–December 2015 Device/application: Discovered systems, including networked uninterruptable power supply (UPS) devices, data center servers, a telephone communications server, and employee workstations Role in infrastructure: Internal reconnaissance efforts could potentially include all deployed devices on the corporate network. Exploitation method: Threat actors likely use a combination of valid user credentials and BlackEnergy 3 plugins developed to conduct network discovery. VS.dll plugin is likely used to leverage MS Sysinternals PsExec to establish remote connections to workstations and servers. Impact: Threat actors are able to enumerate the systems deployed across the network, identify targets, and begin preparations for final attack. 16 Booz Allen Hamilton Booz Allen’s recommended mitigations: • Implement active network security monitoring to identify anomalous network behavior. • Ensure network is appropriately segregated to inhibit lateral movement. • Monitor audit logs for unusual logins or use of administrative privileges (e.g., abnormal hours, unsuccessful login attempts). • Establish production honeypots spread throughout the network to alert on any attempts to login or access files. These honeypot systems have no intentional purpose, and any attempt to access them is a notable security alert. STEP 9: LATERAL MOVEMENT AND TARGET IDENTIFICATION ON ICS NETWORK Threat actors use stolen credentials to access the control environment and conduct reconnaissance on deployed systems. Location: ICS network Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: June 2015–December 2015 Device/application: Discovered systems, including human machine interface (HMI) workstations, distributed management system (DMS) servers, serial-to-Ethernet converters (Moxa UC 7408-LX-Plus, terminal unit (RTU) devices (ABB RTU560 CMU-02), and the substation breakers Role in infrastructure: HMI workstations provide a graphical user interface for operators to remotely monitor and control devices within the control environment. DMS applications enable centralized monitoring and issuing of commands within a control environment. UPS devices condition incoming power to downstream devices and provide temporary battery backup power. Serial-to-Ethernet converters convert serial data from field devices to digital packets, enabling communications with the control center. RTU devices function as a communication processor or a data concentrator in a substation, enabling communications and data transfer between field devices in the substations and the control center. Substation breakers are devices designed to physically interrupt current flows through an electrical circuit. Exploitation method: Threat actors use valid credentials to interact directly with the client application for the DMS server via a VPN, and native remote access services to access employee workstations hosting HMI applications. This access likely enables threat actors to enumerate all networked devices within the control environment. Impact: Threat actors gain access to critical systems, enabling them to begin target selection and preparations for final attack. Booz Allen’s recommended mitigations: • Install and configure a stateful firewall or data diode device between the corporate network and ICS network. • Configure an ICS network demilitarized zone (DMZ) and prohibit any direct traffic between the corporate and ICS networks. All traffic between these domains should be heavily controlled through the use of proxies and be actively monitored. • Any access to systems within the control system DMZ should require the use of two-factor authentication. • Implement network segregation of control system components within the ICS network using zone and conduit techniques. Use industrial firewalls between these network segments whereby only specified traffic can enter and exit. All traffic outside of what is explicitly allowed should trigger an alert. • Take advantage of the predictability in control system traffic by establishing a baseline of normal ICS network communications and conduct active monitoring for anomalies. boozallen.com/ics 17 Steps 10–17 Step 10: Develop Malicious Firmware. Threat actors develop malicious firmware update for identified serial-to-Ethernet converters. Step 11: Deliver Data Destruction Malware. Threat actors likely deliver KillDisk malware to network share and set policy on domain controller to retrieve malware and execute upon system reboot. Step 12: Schedule Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) Disruption. Threat actors schedule unauthorized outage of UPS for telephone communication server and data center servers. Step 13: Trip Breakers. Threat actors use native remote access services and valid credentials to open breakers and disrupt power distribution to over 225,000 customers within three distribution areas. Step 14: Sever Connection to Field Devices. After opening the breakers, threat actors deliver malicious firmware update to serial-to-Ethernet communications devices. The malicious updates render the converters inoperable, and sever connections between the control center and the substations. Step 15: Telephony Denial-of-Service Attack. Threat actors initiate DoS attack on telephone call center at one of the targeted distributors. Step 16: Disable Critical Systems via UPS Outage. Previously scheduled UPS outage cuts power to targeted telephone communications server and data center servers. Step 17: Destroy Critical System Data. Scheduled execution of KillDisk malware erases the master boot records and deletes system log data on targeted machines across the victims’ corporate and EXHIBIT 3. WALK THROUGH OF THREAT ACTOR ACTIVITY, STEPS 10 THROUGH 17 18 Booz Allen Hamilton ACTION ON OBJECTIVES: ATTACK PREPARATION STEP 10: DEVELOP MALICIOUS FIRMWARE Threat actors develop malicious firmware update for identified serial-to-Ethernet converters. Location: External infrastructure Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: June 2015–December 2015 Device/application: Activity conducted external to network Role in infrastructure: Activity conducted external to network Exploitation method: After identifying deployed converts, threat actors begin a malware develop- ment and testing effort on infrastructure outside of the targeted network. Impact: Upon completion of this step, threat actors would have target-specific malware designed to disrupt communications with field devices by disabling deployed converters. Booz Allen’s recommended mitigations: • Implement information classification program to categorize critical system information that could be used by a threat actor. Sensitive information such as this should have restricted distribution and not be publicly available. • Review publicly available information, including job announcements and new supplier agree- ments, to ensure they do not provide inadver- tent information to a threat actor on deployed devices. STEP 11: DELIVER DATA DESTRUCTION MALWARE Threat actors likely deliver KillDisk malware to network share and set policy on domain controller to retrieve malware and execute upon system reboot. Location: Corporate and ICS network Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: December 2015, directly preceding attack Device/application: Network share and Windows domain controller server Role in infrastructure: The network share provides access to shared digital resources, and the Windows domain controller manages access control throughout the network. Exploitation method: Threat actors likely use stolen credentials to place KillDisk malware on a network share, then set the retrieval and execution of the malicious files by implementing a policy on the compromised domain controller server. f Impact: Prescheduling execution of malware enables coordination of multiple attack compo- nents, such that data destruction coincides with or shortly follows attacks against breakers. Booz Allen’s recommended mitigations: • Utilize network- and host-based antivirus software to detect and prevent known malware from infecting organization systems. • Regularly scan organizational machine images with YARA rules to detect malware prior to execution. • Restrict and monitor network share access permissions. STEP 12: SCHEDULE UPS DISRUPTION Threat actors schedule unauthorized outage of UPS for telephone communication server and data center servers. Location: Corporate and ICS network Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: Directly preceding December 2015 attack Device/application: Networked UPS devices with remote management interface f. This tactic was observed in attacks against the Ukrainian television broadcaster in October 2015. Domain controllers and KillDisk execution upon reboot, observed in the December 2015 attacks, both indicate this tactic may have been repeated against the electricity distributors. boozallen.com/ics 19 Role in infrastructure: Prevent power outages from disrupting continuous operation of critical systems. Exploitation method: Threat actors likely use valid credentials to access privileged employee accounts, then use this access to remotely schedule unauthorized power outages. Impact: Prescheduling outages enables coordination of multiple attack components, such that critical systems also go down as a result of the power outages, stifling potential restoration efforts. Booz Allen’s recommended mitigations: • Isolate UPS systems, and other facility management systems, from both the ICS and corporate networks. • Disable remote management services for UPS devices wherever possible. ACTION ON OBJECTIVES: EXECUTE ATTACK STEP 13: TRIP BREAKERS Threat actors use native remote access services and valid credentials to open breakers and disrupt power distribution to more than 225,000 customers within three distribution areas. Location: ICS network Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: December 23, 2015, during Device/application: HMI workstations, DMS servers, RTU, and the substation breakers Role in infrastructure: HMI workstations provide a graphical user interface for operators to remotely monitor and control devices within the control environment. DMS applications enable centralized monitoring and issuing of commands within a control environment. Substation breakers are devices designed to physically interrupt current flows through an electrical circuit. Exploitation method: Threat actors use valid credentials to seize control of operator worksta- tions, access DMS client application via VPN, and issue unauthorized commands to breakers at substations. Impact: Opening of breakers results in disruption of electricity service to customers. Booz Allen’s recommended mitigations: • Disable remote access into an organization’s ICS network wherever possible. • Require direct operator action to allow a remote user connectivity into the ICS VPN. • Restrict user accounts with remote access privileges to the minimum necessary and require two-factor authentication for all VPN connections. • Restrict functions of users who remotely access the control system environment wherever possible (e.g., read-only privileges). • Develop and practice incident response scenarios to understand how to disrupt remote connectivity and manually operate ICS equip- ment to bring operations back to a safe state. STEP 14: SEVER CONNECTION TO FIELD DEVICES After opening the breakers, threat actors deliver malicious firmware update to serial-to-Ethernet communications devices. The malicious updates render the converters inoperable and sever connections between the control center and the substations. Location: ICS network Action: Active threat actor activity Timeline: December 23, 2015, during attack Device/application: Serial-to-Ethernet converters (Moxa UC 7408-LX-Plus, 20 Booz Allen Hamilton Role in infrastructure: Convert serial data from field devices to digital packets to be transmitted to remote monitoring and administration systems within the control network. Exploitation method: Threat actors use network access to push the malicious update over the network to targeted devices. Impact: Operators are unable to remotely close the breakers, requiring workers to manually close breakers at each substation. Forcing this manual response draws out recovery time. Booz Allen’s recommended mitigations: • Actively monitor ICS network for spikes in traffic or anomalous communications associ- ated with firmware updates or reprogramming. • Use physical means to restrict remote reprogramming and firmware updates of field devices (e.g., jumper settings, remote/run/prog switches). • Implement a patch and vulnerability manage- ment plan for all computer systems, field devices, and network infrastructure equipment. • Maintain offline spares of common ICS devices within an organization to aid in the restoration of compromised devices. STEP 15: TELEPHONy DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACK Threat actors initiate DoS attack on telephone call center at one of the targeted distributors. Location: Corporate network g Action: Likely automated process Timeline: Dec 23, 2015, during attack Device/application: Operator telephone call center Role in infrastructure: Receive external telephone communications from customers. Exploitation method: Threat actors likely use automated IP-based call generators to flood the targeted call center. Impact: Automated calls overwhelm resources at call center, blocking legitimate communications from customers. Booz Allen’s recommended mitigations: • Establish a relationship with the telecommunications provider to aid in filtering out malicious calls during response activities. g. Public reporting did not indicate whether the call center deployed an automated system to receive calls or whether calls were answered manually by call center personnel. boozallen.com/ics 21 STEP 16: DISABLE CRITICAL SYSTEMS VIA UPS OUTAGE Previously scheduled UPS outage suspends temporary battery backup power to targeted telephone communications server and data center servers. Location: Corporate and ICS network Action: Execution of prescheduled process Timeline: December 23, 2015, during attack Device/application: Networked UPS devices with remote management interface, telephone communications server, and data center servers Role in infrastructure: Prevent power outages from disrupting continuous operation of critical systems. Exploitation method: Threat actors use network access to schedule the temporary backup power to be offline at the time of the power outages. Impact: Power loss to telephone server disrupts communications across remote sites, and disrup- tions at control centers inhibit ability to monitor and respond to attack against breakers. The disruption at the data center and associated system reboot trigger execution of KillDisk malware. Booz Allen’s recommended mitigations: • Isolate UPS systems, and other facility management systems, from both the ICS and corporate networks. • Disable remote management services for UPS devices wherever possible. STEP 17: DESTROY CRITICAL SYSTEM DATA Scheduled execution of KillDisk malware erases the master boot records and deletes system log data on targeted machines across the victims’ corporate and ICS network. Location: Corporate network and ICS network Action: Malware execution Timeline: December 23, 2015, during attack Device/application: RTU device (ABB RTU560 servers and workstations used by management, human resources (HR), and finance staff Role in infrastructure: The RTU functions as a communication processor or data concentrator in a substation, enabling communications and data transfer between field devices in the substations and the control center. 64 Servers and workstations are used by management, HR, and finance staff to conduct business administration operations. Exploitation method: Malware is retrieved from the network share and executed on networked devices according direction received via domain controller policy or local Windows Task Scheduler. Impact: Targeted systems are rendered inoperable, and critical data is destroyed. Booz Allen’s recommended mitigations: • Utilize network- and host-based antivirus software to detect and prevent known malware from infecting organization systems. • Regularly scan organizational machine images with YARA rules to detect malware prior to execution. • Develop and practice contingency plans that include backup and restoration of critical data. 22 Booz Allen Hamilton T O P 1 0 TA K E AWAY S What to Consider When Protecting Your OT Environment 1. Know your environment. Identifying risk starts with the need to understand your operational environment, including the topology, network and wireless connection points, and connected devices and assets. Starting with a thorough understanding of the people, processes, and technology that comprise an operational environment provides the foundation to identifying what you need to defend. 2. Identify the key OT processes and data that need to be protected. All processes and data are not created equal, and cybersecurity professionals often do not understand the core operations of an ICS environment. Cybersecurity professionals need to partner with plant operators to identify and under- stand the essential operational processes that, when disrupted, can cause significant impact on operations. By assessing and prioritizing these key processes, focused mitigation strategies can be developed to both defend and recover from cyberattacks. 3. Understand the threats. Threats against ICS environments continue to increase, and cybercriminals see this as an opportunity to quickly monetize their trade through ransom- ware and other attacks. Stay informed about what’s happening across the broader threat landscape, both within your industry vertical and beyond. Understand how malicious actors may compromise your environment, whether it’s launching phishing attacks against operators in your plant or injecting malicious code in ICS devices at some point in the supply chain. Engage in an active dialog with your security team to ensure they are on the lookout for these types of events, and be prepared to quickly respond. 4. Segment your OT and IT environments. Like the Ukraine incident, many OT attacks originate in the enterprise environment. It is important that you understand your network boundaries and connection points. We recommend implementing network segmen- tation between your environment using VLANs and firewalls. Also, when necessary for ultimate protection, consider data diodes or other unidirectional technologies for one-way data transfer from sensitive environments to authorized systems. 5. Focus on the Cyber security basics. Often, we are making it easy on cybercriminals by forgetting about the basics. Treat your OT environment like you treat the enterprise. Remember to focus on basic cyber hygiene such as (a) strong passwords (or even a password if not already protected); (b) multifactor authentication for remote access, third parties, and maintenance providers; (c) access control to protect key processes and data; and (d) the principle of least privilege for user and admin accounts. 6. Maintain your OT security posture. We often find HMI and other connected devices in the OT environment to be outdated from a patching perspective—remember, keep your patches up to date if possible. We recognize there are cases where vendors will not support their product when new patches are applied. In these cases, get creative because you’re still at risk. Consider alternative controls, such as whitelisting or network-based security appliances that block access based on known vulnerabilities. boozallen.com/ics 23 7. Focus on proactive monitoring and detection, not just compliance. A wise person once said, “Compliance solves yesterday’s problem today.” In today’s cybersecurity landscape, new vulnerabilities and threats emerge daily. We recommend instrumenting your environment with both traditional network and end-point security solutions, along with emerging real-time OT data collection sensors. We also recommend implementing an OT monitoring environ- ment, such as Splunk, that captures and correlates events. For security operators, we recommend watching critical processes and data for firmware and configuration changes outside the proper change control process. 8. Train your operators. Remember, people are usually the weakest link in a cybersecurity attack. Educate your team about the cyber and technology risks facing OT and ICS—and build awareness of the impacts these threats can have on your OT environment. Cyber criminals are actively looking to exploit ICS operations; educate staff to watch out for phishing emails and immediately report them to your cyber response team. 9. Develop an OT incident response (IR) plan. Everyone is vulnerable to a cyberattack; it’s important to be prepared. We recommend creating an OT IR plan that addresses safety and plant operations stability as its primary goal. The IR plan should include key stake- holders, such Health and Safety, Legal, Compliance, and Environmental. Once developed, it’s important that you socialize and prepare to execute your plan. We recommend using scenario-driven exercises for operators to understand threats and how to react to a cyber incident. Practice and drill using the IR plan—and do it regularly! 10. “Red Team” your environment. Cybercriminals think differently from traditional network defenders. They are crafty and financially motivated. It’s important to view your environment from the eyes of your adversary. We recommend engaging a professional team to assess your environ- ment from an “attacker’s view.” While conventional red team practices may not work in an OT environment, a skilled team that understands the delicacies of operating in this space can use offline environments and built-in redundancy to conduct these activities without affecting your operations. Once completed, you can develop a mitiga- tion plan based on findings and periodically re-engage the red team! 24 Booz Allen Hamilton The attack against Ukraine’s electricity distributors was unparalleled in its impact and demonstrated disciplined, professional execution. It is highly likely that this attack was politically motivated and conducted by a state-backed group. these threat actors were among the most well- resourced and well-organized adversaries an organization can face. ICS operators are capable of meeting these adversaries head-on, and the tools needed to mitigate and minimize the impact of an attack such as this are readily available. WHAT COULD HAVE PREVENTED THE ATTACK FOR UKRAINE? At the time of the attack, though the Ukrainian electrical distributors had exploitable holes in their security posture, they were not without defense. The Ukrainian operators had implemented firewalls between their internal networks and had segmented their ICS environment from their This segmentation should have forced attackers to search for vulnerabilities on the deployed systems, had they not already stolen valid credentials. The Ukrainian firms were also fairly well positioned to respond to the attacks; their extensive experience in manual operation of their infrastructure enabled them to get impacted systems up and running within hours of the attack, despite lacking a prepared system failure contingency plan. firms were well prepared to investigate the incident, as they had extensive logging capability implemented across their systems and firewalls. 67 Despite these precautions, the attackers were ultimately successful. The biggest point of failure in the operator’s security posture, which allowed attackers to interfere with the physical systems, was the enablement of remote access for their control environment and the lack of two-factor WHAT ABOUT THE UNITED STATES? The risks demonstrated in the attacks in Ukraine are significant for the US for several reasons. Variants of BlackEnergy malware have been identified on multiple critical infrastructure networks in the US over the past several years. 69 Additionally, disruptions on the US grids would likely have a greater financial and social impact than in Ukraine. Given the right grid operating conditions and timing of a cyberattack, another Northeast Blackout or greater could occur. Restoration from such a blackout could be even longer if utilities were unable to remotely coordi- nate and operate key portions of their system. Though a destructive attack like the Ukrainian event has not occurred in the US energy sector, various actors conduct reconnaissance and technical collection on the sector. In fiscal year 2015, members of the US energy sector reported 46 cybersecurity incidents i to ICS-CERT. 70 ICS-CERT does not publish a breakdown of the types of incidents by sector, but it revealed that 31 percent of total incidents reported across all sectors involved successful intrusion into operators’ assets, a third of which included accessing control systems. 71 A few disclosed examples of reconnaissance targeting the US energy sector exist, the most relevant of which is a BlackEnergy campaign active from at least 2011 to which the US government reportedly suspected to be Russian-government orches- In this case, the attackers who gained access to systems did not attempt to “damage, modify, or otherwise disrupt…processes.” 74 C O N C L U S I O N h. An in-depth analysis of the weaponized file samples and recovered VBA scripts recovered for this report are provided in Appendix B. i. ICS-CERT defines an incident as “the act of violating an explicit or implied security policy.” Examples of such incidents include the receipt of spear-phishing email messages, attempts to gain unauthorized systems access, and the existence of malware in either corporate or operational environments. Source: url boozallen.com/ics 25 In the near future, the likelihood of an attack against US electrical infrastructure on the scale of the Ukraine attack is very low. Based on previous research, we conclude that several nation states have the capability to conduct similar time-con- suming, strategically complex attacks, but, based their current relations with the United States, these countries lack the intent to carry out such a brazen, destructive attack against US critical infrastructure. In recent years, we have seen several government regulations and industry initiatives that have reduced the risk of such attacks. These efforts are designed and implemented to mitigate cyber risk and ultimately to protect the reliability and availability of the electrical grid. That said, operators must remain vigilant as many threats do exist. Cybercriminals and other nonstate actors could use similar techniques and tactics to those in the Ukraine incident to deliver ransomware or other create other equally disruptive scenarios without attacking the grid directly. Additionally, global relations are in constant flux and a significant deterioration in relations with any of several countries could induce them to conduct a Ukraine-style attack in the US.
