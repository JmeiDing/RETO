updated activity in 2017: New targets, use of MS Access Macros and CVE 2017-0199, and possible mobile espionageBy GReAT on October 30, 2017. 9:00 am1. Summary informationThe Gaza cybergang is an Arabic-language, politically-motivated cybercriminal group, operating since 2012 and actively targeting the MENA (Middle East North Africa) region. The Gaza cybergang’s attacks have never slowed down and its typical targets include government entities/embassies, oil and gas, media/press, activists, politicians, and diplomats.One of the interesting new facts, uncovered in mid-2017, is its discovery inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA region, inﬁltrating systems and pilfering data, apparently for more than a year.Another interesting ﬁnding is the use of the recently discovered CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability, and Microsoft Access ﬁles into which the download scripts were embedded to reduce the likelihood of their detection. Traces of mobile malware that started to appear from late April 2017, are also being investigated.Recent targets for the group seem to be varied in nature; the attackers do not appear to be choosing targets selectively, but rather seeking diﬀerent kinds of MENA intelligence.Some of the interesting new updates about the Gaza cybergang:Gaza cybergang attackers have continued their interest in government entities in MENA New targets identiﬁed include oil and gas in MENA New tools and techniques includeAbuse of the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability Usage of macros inside Microsoft Access ﬁles, enabling lower detection rates Possible Android mobile malware being used by attackersPrevious published research: url Lab products and services successfully detect and block Gaza cybergang attacks, detection names below:HEUR:Exploit.MSOﬃce.Generic HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Cometer.gen HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Downeks Trojan-Spy.MSIL.Downeks Win32.Bublik Win32.AgentbMore information about Gaza cybergang is available to customers of the Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting Service. Contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com2. Technical detailsPreviously, Gaza cybergang attacks were surprisingly successful in using simple and common tools to achieve their goals. They relied on a variety of Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to perform their activities, including Downeks, Qasar, Cobaltstrike…As recently as June 2017, however, the attackers started using the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability which enables direct code execution from a Microsoft oﬃce document on non-patched victim systems (Cobaltstrike payload in this case). Another ﬁnding is a possible Android Trojan that the attackers positioned on one of their command servers in April 2017.In most cases, malware is sent by email as a compressed attachment or download links. Starting from March 2017, we have observed downloaders or Microsoft oﬃce documents with embedded macros being sent to victims. When opened, the downloader would contact a URL or IP address to retrieve the actual payload. Once successfully executed, the malware grants full access to the attackers, providing them with the ability to collect ﬁles, keystrokes and screenshots from victims’ devices. If the initial downloaded malware was detected by the victim, the downloader would attempt to retrieve other malware ﬁles to the victim’s device, in the hope that one of those ﬁles would work.The full list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) can be found in Appendix I. The list of the most interesting lure content, malware ﬁles and related droppers, and command servers can be found in Appendix II.3.

New ﬁndingsGaza Cybergang attackers have been continuously evolving their skills on diﬀerent levels, using new methods and techniques to deliver malware, inaddition to adapting social engineering decoys to regional political and humanitarian incidents.In mid-2017, the attackers were discovered inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA region, inﬁltrating systems and pilfering data, apparently for more than a year. The malware ﬁles that were found had been reported previously: url wheres-your-ir-team/72283/While traces of Android mobile malware have been spotted, attackers have continuously used the Downeks downloader and the Quasar or Cobaltstrike RATs to target Windows devices, enabling them to obtain remote access spying and data exﬁltration abilities. This is now achieved more eﬃciently using the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability which enables direct code execution abilities from a Microsoft oﬃce document on non- patched victim Windows systems. The use of Microsoft Access database ﬁles has also enabled the attackers to maintain low levels of detection, as it’s not an uncommon method to deliver malware.These developments have helped the attackers continue their operations, targeting a variety of victims and organizations, sometimes even bypassing defences and persisting for prolonged periods.4.1. The extended use of humanitarian and political causes in social engineering attacksAttackers have continuously targeted victims and organizations in government entities/embassies, oil and gas, media/press, activists, politicians, and diplomats.The Gaza cybergang relies increasingly on advanced and up-to-date social engineering techniques with political and humanitarian aspects that directly reﬂect regional incidents. Here is a short list of incidents that were each used multiple times:Palestinian Government not paying salaries to Gaza employees Palestinian prisoners’ hunger strike in Israeli jails The political crisis in QatarRecent targets for the group seem to be varied in nature, the attackers do not appear to be choosing targets selectively, but rather seeking any type breaking the news agency)Attackers have recently used political events related to the Qatar political 04C2: moreoﬀer[.]lifeFirst seen: 27 May 2017Translation: new details on the hack of the Qatar News Agency4.2.

The vulnerability is in the code that handles Ole2Link embedded objects, which allows Microsoft Oﬃce Word to run remote ﬁles, downloaded in this case from 138.68.242[.]68. The downloaded payload is Cobaltstrike, which then connects to lol.mynetav[.]org to receive commands from the attackers. Additional details on the Gaza cybergang’s use of CVE 2017-0199 with Cobaltstrike, can be found here: url Possible Android mobile malwareTraces of APK ﬁles have been seen on one of the attackers’ command centers, starting from 23-04-2017.URL: url 1.04_ApkHouse[.]com/Dont-Starve-Pocket-Edition- 1.04_ApkHouse[.]com.apkThe ﬁle name (Dont-Starve-Pocket-Edition-1.04_ApkHouse[.]com.apk), is an Android application ﬁle hiding as a popular game. We believe the android Trojan could be related to a previously investigated Android Trojan around the Gaza strip: url weakest-link-of-the-strongest-chain/77562/5. ConclusionThe Gaza Cybergang has demonstrated a large number of attacks and advanced social engineering, in addition to active development of attacks, infrastructure and the utilization of new methods and techniques. Attackers are actively improving their toolkit in an eﬀort to minimize their exposure to security products and services. Kaspersky Lab expects these types of attacks to intensify in the near term, both in terms of quality and quantity.In order to protect your company from malware, Kaspersky Lab researchers recommend implementing the following measures:Educate staﬀ to be able to distinguish spear-phishing emails or a phishing link from legitimate emails and links Use proven corporate grade security solution in combination with anti-targeted attacks solutions capable of catching attacks by analyzing network anomalies Provide security staﬀ with access to the latest threat intelligence data, which will arm them with helpful tools for targeted attacks prevention and discovery, such as indicators of compromise and YARA rules Make sure enterprise grade patch management processes are well established and executed.More information about Gaza cybergang is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting Service.
