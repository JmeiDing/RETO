OPERATIONAURORAFebruary 10, 2010Cyber Espionage is a critical issue. Over 80% of intellectual property is stored online digitally. The computing infrastructure in a typical Enterprise is more vulnerable to attack than ever before. Current security solutions are proving ineffective at stopping cyber espionage. Malware is the single greatest problem in computer security today. Yet, malware represents only the tip of the spear. The true threat is the human being who is operating the malware. This human and the organization represented is the true threat that is targeting information for the purposes of ﬁ nancial gain, theft of state secrets, and theft of intellectual property. True threat intelligence requires reaching beyond malware infections to identify the individuals, country of origin, and intent of the attacker.2 HB GARY THREAT REPORT: OPERATION AURORATHREAT SUMMARY The Aurora malware operation was identifi ed recently and made public by Google and McAfee. This malware operation has been associated with intellectual property theft including source code and technical diagrams (CAD, oil exploration bid-data, etc). Companies hit have been publically speculated, including Google, Adobe, Yahoo, Symantec, Juniper Networks, Rackspace, Northrop Grumman, and Dow Chemical. The malware package used with Aurora is mature and been in development since at least 2006. The Aurora operation is characterized by a remotely operated backdoor program that persists on a Windows computer. This backdoor program has several capabilities that are outlined below.KEY FINDINGSEvidence collected around the malware operation suggest that Operation Aurora is simply an example of highly effective malware penetration. There is not signifi cant evidence to attribute the operation directly to the Chinese Government. However, key actors have been identifi ed in association with malware operations that utilize Chinese systems and native language malware. This has lead to a great deal of speculation about Chinese-State involvement. It must be noted that a large and thriving underground economy exists to both build and disseminate malware worldwide, and that most of this malware is capable of intellectual property theft. The malicious hacking underculture is strong in China, as in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, and clearly enmeshed into a global criminal economy of data theft. While diffi cult to conclude that these activities receive any form of state sponsorship or direction, the malware operation remains a funded and signifi cant risk to intellectual property in the enterprise.ASPECTDESCRIPTIONTargetOriginDevelopersThe operation is targeting intellectual property with no specifi c industry focus. This is an example of “not knowing what they are looking for until they fi nd it”.It is highly probable that the malware was developed in native Chinese language, and the operation control system is designed for Chinese users, indicating the entire operation is Chinese. This does not, however, mean the Chinese Government is using the system.Forensic tool-marks in the CRC algorithm can be traced to Chinese origin. That, combined with domain registration information, leads to at least one potential actor, Peng Yongii. The malware has been in development since at least 2006. It has been updated several times.ASPECTDESCRIPTIONOperatorsIntentComsOperators of the malware appear to use certain domains for C&C control. Dynamic DNS is a key feature of the operation, with many known C&C servers operating from domains registered through Peng Yong’s 3322.org service.The primary intent is the theft of intellectual property.Communication is encrypted over HTTP, port 443, obfuscated with a weak encryption scheme. The C&C servers tend to operate from domains hosted on dynamic DNS.ATTRIBUTIONAt this time, there is very little available in terms ofattribution. A CRC algorithm tends to indicate the malware package is of Chinese origin, and many attacks are sourced out of a service called 3322.org — a small company operating out of Changzhou. The owner is Peng Yong, a Mandarin speaker who may have some programming background with such algorithms. His dynamic DNS service hosts over 1 million domain names. Over the last year, HBGary has analyzed thousands of distinct malware samples that communicate with 3322.org. While Peng Yong is clearly tolerant of cyber crime operating through his domain services, this does not indicate he has any direct involvement with Aurora.TOOLMARKDESCRIPTIONEmbedded Resource Language CodeUnited StatesCRC Algorithm Table of ConstantsEmbedded systems/ Chinese publicationiiiDNS registration servicesPeng Yong, othersDETECTThis section of the report details how you can detectOperation Aurora in your Enterprise. The exploit and payload vehicle consists of the following components: • JavaScript based exploit vector, known to exploit IE 6 • Shellcode component, embedded in the JavaScript • Secondary payload server that delivers a dropper • The dropper itself, which only used once and then deleted • The backdoor program which is decompressed fromthe dropperFebruary 10, 2010 3JAVASCRIPT AND SHELLCODEThe JavaScript based attack vector associated withOperation Aurora was published in the public domain in early January 2010. Microsoft details the vulnerability in Security Bulletin MS10-002. Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8 (except Internet Explorer 6 for supported editions of Windows Server 2003) are affected. Exploit code analyzed by HBGary reveals that only Internet Explorer 6 was targeted during Operation Aurora.

The exploit code used by the original attackers was quickly improved and added to Metasploit thus greatly expanding the potential number of attackers and reliability of code.The JavaScript performs a heap spray attack and injectsthe embedded shellcode described below. The JavaScript exploits the vulnerability in Internet Explorer by copying, releasing, and then referencing a Document Object Model (DOM) element.JAVASCRIPT ARTIFACTSPATTERNInitial encrypted dropper download.

Upon successful exploitation of Internet Explorer, the shellcode will download an obfuscated second stage executable from url ftpaccess.cc/demo/ad.jpg which is the dropper. Note: these fi les are specifi c to the sample we analyzed at HBGary, Inc. The attackers must use a second stage download mechanism to achieve full system access due to memory constraints. It is unlikely that the fi nal payload could be delivered through the original exploit given these conditions. The dropper is XOR encrypted with a 0x95 key. The shellcode copies this encrypted binary to the user’s AppData directory as “a.exe”. The shellcode then decrypts “a.exe” and moves it to “b.exe” in the same directory. Then “b.exe” is executed. The following actionable intelligence can be used to identify exploit remnants in the heap space of Internet Explorer post exploitation attempt. These patterns can be searched for when doing memory analysis of a victim system.SHELLCODE ARTIFACTSPATTERNSelf-decrypting code using a constant XOR value.80 34 0B D8 80 34 0B D8Kernel32.dll searching code.64 A1 30 00 00 00 8B 40 0C 8B 70 1CPush Urlmon string to stack using two push statements.68 6F 6E 00 00 68 75 72 6C 6DThe following SNORT rules have been released by the Emerging Threats project to detected the fi nal payload command and control communications.Network Detection Signaturesalert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET 443 (msg:”ET TROJAN Aurora Backdoor (C&C) client connection to CnC”; fl ow:established,to_ server; content:”|ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 00 fe ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 88 ff|”; depth:20; fl owbits:set,ET.aurora.init; classtype:trojan-activity; reference:url,www.trustedsource.org/blog/373/An-Insight-into-the- Aurora-Communication-Protocol; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats. net/2010695; reference:url,www.emergingthreats.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb. cgi/sigs/VIRUS/TROJAN_Aurora; sid:2010695; rev:2;)alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET 443 -> $HOME_NET any (msg:”ET TROJAN Aurora Backdoor (C&C) connection CnC response”; fl owbits:isset,ET. aurora.init; fl ow:established,from_server; content:”|cc cc cc cc cd cc cc cc cd cc cc cc cc cc cc cc|”; depth:16; classtype:trojan-activity; reference:url,www.trustedsource.org/blog/373/An-Insight-into-the- Aurora-Communication-Protocol; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats. net/2010696; reference:url,www.emergingthreats.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb. cgi/sigs/VIRUS/TROJAN_Aurora; sid:2010696; rev:2;)DROPPERThe initial dropper is merely a detonation package thatdecompresses an embedded DLL into the Windows system32 directory and loads it as a service. The initial dropper is likely to be packed (UPX, etc). The dropper has an embedded DLL that is decompressed to the windows system32 directory. This DLL will be named to resemble existing services (rasmon. dll, etc). In order to evade forensics, the fi le-time of the dropped DLL will be modifi ed to match that of an existing system DLL (user32.dll, etc). The dropped DLL is loaded into its own svchost.exe process. Several registry keys are created and then deleted as part of this process. Finally, the dropper deletes itself from the system by using a dissolving batch fi le (DFS.BAT, etc).ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCEPATTERNService Key & Value Note: deleted after dropPath to backdoor Note: deleted after stage 1Path to backdoor Note: persistentSOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\ Data: Ups???

During stage one, the dropper will install the payload as a service running under the name Ups??? (where ??? are three random characters). Once executing, the payload will immediately delete the fi rst service and enter stage-two. During stage-two, the payload will register a new, second service under the name RaS??? (where ??? are three random characters). This new service will point to the same backdoor DLL, no new fi les are involved. Note: the three character prefi xes Ups and RaS can easily be modifi ed by the attacker.Once the new service is registered, the payload will access an embedded resource that is encrypted. The decryption goes through several phases. The encrypted data block contains the DNS name for the command and control server (homeunix. com, etc). This data block is confi gurable before the malware is deployed. The data block length is hard-coded (0x150 or 336 bytes). During phase one, this data block is fed through a simple XOR (0x99), resulting in an ASCII-string. Next, the resulting ASCII-string is fed into a base64 decoding function, producing a binary string. Finally, the resulting base64 decoded binary string is fed through another XOR (0xAB), resulting in clear-text. The three primary encryption loops are colored and marked in Figure 1. The resulting clear-text buffer contains several fi elds in both ASCII and UNICODE, including the C&C server address.Figure 1.

This module has been written in c and includes several specifi c methods and encodings that provide forensic track-ability.The above screenshot illustrates a REcon™ trace on themalware dropper and subsequent service creation. Location A. represents the dropper program, which unpacks itself and decompresses a fi le to the system32 directory. Point B. represents the initial svchost.exe startup, which is loading the malware payload. Location C. is the actual execution of the malware service, which remains persistent. At points E. and F. you can see the malware checking in with the command and control server. Finally, location D. represents the dissolvable batch fi le which deletes the initial dropper and then itself.CAPABILITYThe malware has generic and fl exible capabilities. There aredistinct command handlers in the malware that allow fi les to be stolen and remote commands to be executed. The command handler is illustrated in Figure 2. At location A. the command number is checked. At locations marked B. are each individual command handler, as controlled by the C&C server and commandFebruary 10, 2010 7number in the C&C packet. Location C. is where the result of each command is sent back to the C&C server.Figure 2. C&C Command ParserCOPYCATS AND VARIANTSWith the release of MS10-002, and the subsequentintegration with Metasploit, the exploit vector used with Aurora has been adopted laterally within the malware development economy. Therefore, the use of MS10-002 should not be construed as an Aurora infection without further analysis of the dropped payload. Forensic toolmarks and link analysis have revealed several different threat groups who are employing common IE exploit vectors. HBGary is currently tracking several groups who operate malware systems of this nature.HBGary is using forensic toolmarks to trace the sourcecode origins of binary malware samples dropped in conjunction with the MS10-002 exploit vector. For example, in Figure 3, link analysis is being used to track the identity of a threat actor in conjunction with his known Digital DNA™. HBGary’s Digital DNA™ database not only codifi es the behavior of software, but also the coding idioms, algorithms, and methods of individual developers. In this way, individual threat actors can be tracked with Digital DNA™.In the example, link analysis is provided by Palantir™. The screenshot illustrates only a subset of the data being tracked by HBGary, and sensitive information has been redacted.At location 1. is a dropper obtained from an exploit server directly accessed from the extracted shellcode from a MS10- 002 JavaScript vector. Location 2. represents a forensic toolmark within the dropped executable. This toolmark was obtained using physical memory assessment of the live executable, after it was allowed to unpack itself in a virtual machine. This assessment was performed with HBGary Responder™. At location 3., the recovered toolmark(s) were researched against published source code artifacts on the Internet. From this, a single posting was discovered with this exact toolmark, and this posting exists only in one place and is of Chinese origin. From this, the author of the source code was determined to be XXXXXXXX. At location 4., all social cyberspaces used by XXXXXXX were then enumerated. From this, postings in Traditional and Simplifi ed Chinese were discovered that confi rm that XXXXXX is the author and supplier of a malware package known as ‘NB’ or ‘Netbot Attacker’. Within the social space around ‘Netbot Attacker’ are individuals who are testing and/or asking for technical support regarding the malware package operation. These individuals have been grouped within Palantir™ as ‘technical support for bot’ at location 5.Figure 3. Link Analysis of Malware Actors using Palantir™The above process, when carried further, produces many more social links. Attribution such as this allows resolution and visibility into the intent of individual threat groups.8 HB GARY THREAT REPORT: OPERATION AURORADIGITAL DNA INOCULATION SHOTHBGary has prepared an inoculation shot for this malware.The inoculation shot is a small, signed binary that will allow you to scan for, and optionally remove, this malware from your Enterprise network. The aurora innoculation shot can be downloaded from www.hbgary.com.When the aurora innoculation shot is executed it will querythe user for authentication credentials. Optionally the user can just hit “cancel” to use the currently logged on USER’s authentication token. Some sample usages are listed below.To scan a single machine: AuroraInnoculation.exe -scan MYBOXNAMETo scan multiple machines: AuroraInnoculation.exe -list targets.txt MCAFEE EPO CUSTOMERS DETECTION OF AURORA THREATS WITH DIGITAL DNA FOR EPOCustomers of McAfee ePolicy Orchastrator, integratedwith Digital DNA, can detect emerging advanced persistent threats. To detect Aurora, users should perform a Digital DNA Sequence search with the above mentioned sequence for Aurora, and set a fuzzy match of 90% or greater. Once machines are detected, the user is encouraged to use the freely available inoculation shot to remove the infection.RESPONDSeveral Enterprise products have the capability to scanfor and potentially remove the Aurora malware. Detection of the malware is covered in detail, from multiple aspects, in the Detect section above. When using a Digital DNA™ capable platform such as McAfee ePO, you can search the Enterprise for the following Digital DNA sequence (recommend a tight match, 90% or higher).DIGITAL DNA SEQUENCE FOR AURORA MALWARE01 B4 EE 00 AE DA 00 8C 16 00 89 22 00 46 73 00 C6 49 00 0B AE 01 E7 9F 04 05 81 01 0E DF 01 79 D8 00 25 6A 00 15 49 00 47 22 00 4B 67 0F 2D CC 01 29 67 01 35 99To thwart command and control and prevent data loss,known C&C domains should be blocked at the egress fi rewall. The domains listed in the Detect section represent a signifi cant set of those currently known to be operating. IDS signatures similar to the one illustrated in the Detect section should be used to detect inbound exploit attempts, and machines accepting this data should be scanned for potential infections. Many A/V products now contain signatures for the Aurora exploit and will be effective in detection and removal. However, the attackers that represent the threat will not be deterred, and variants of the attack are nearly assured.FACTORSC&C protocolInstallation and DeploymentDESCRIPTIONIf a variant is developed, it will very likely use the same C&C protocol, but may change the header of the packet and the constants used for connection setup. This will evade IDS / Firewall rules designed to detect the current scheme. It is unlikely the attackers will change the encryption setup, however.The method used to install the service is highly effective. Although the fi lenames will likely change, the actual method will likely remain.INOCULATIONMORE INFORMATION ABOUT HBGARY, INCHBGary, Inc is the leading provider of solutions to detect,diagnose and respond to advance malware threats in a thorough and forensically sound manner.
