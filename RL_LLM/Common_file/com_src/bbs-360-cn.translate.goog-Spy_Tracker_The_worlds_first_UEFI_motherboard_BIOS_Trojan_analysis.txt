To this end, we asked Mr. Li to mail the motherboard to the Beijing headquarters of 360 Company for analysis, and found that this is a new type of BIOS BOOTKIT that has never been seen before. Since it will set up a spy account in the system for remote control, we named it Spy Shadow Trojan.Compared with the previous BIOS malicious code, Spy Shadow Trojan has stronger compatibility and higher technical level:1. The world's first real attack to infect UEFI motherboards. Spy Shadow Trojan supports a lot of BIOS versions, and it is the only known Trojan that can infect UEFI motherboards. The Spy Shadow Trojan will infect the BIOS boot module in UEFI compatibility mode, and UEFI+GPT mode will not be affected. The BMW BIOS Trojan (named Mebromi by foreign manufacturers) that appeared in 2011 only supports the infection of a specific Award BIOS;1/182. Strong system compatibility, supports all mainstream 32-bit and 64-bit Windows platforms, including the latest 64-bit Win10.Figure: 64-bit Win10 infected spyware Trojan triggers Microsoft PATCH GUARD, causing repeated blue screen [/i]It is understood that Mr. Li purchased this second-hand motherboard from an online store. According to the phenomenon of Internet search for spyware Trojans, Mr. Li's experience is not an exception. It is speculated from the existing samples that the malicious code may be flashed into the motherboard BIOS by the programmer, and sold and circulated through e-commerce channels.In view of the complexity and particularity of the motherboard structure, at this stage, only by re- flashing the BIOS can completely remove the Spy Shadow Trojan. The following is a detailed analysis of the technical principles of the Spy Shadow Trojan.▌ 0x01 BIOS and UEFIBIOS is an acronym for English \Basic Input Output System\, and the Chinese name after literal translation is \Basic Input Output System\. In fact, it is a set of programs that are solidified on a ROM chip on the motherboard of the computer. It saves the most important basic input and output programs of the computer, system setting information, self-checking programs after booting, and system self-starting programs. Executes prior to the operating system and is responsible for loading and executing the MBR code. Its main function is to provide the computer with the lowest- level, most direct hardware settings and control.2/18UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) stands for "Unified Extensible Firmware Interface". It is a new motherboard boot item. It is being regarded as the successor of BIOS with a history of more than 20 years. Since Win8, it has been promoted by Microsoft. push. UEFI claims to be able to resist Bootkit attacks by protecting the pre-boot or pre-boot process, and has higher security than BIOS.▌ 0x02 Technical Analysis2.1 CSM module analysisThe Trojan is located in the BIOS fileThe motherboard is B85M-G-ASUS-0904 from ASUS. Different from the normal BIOS, the CSMCORE module on the Ma motherboard is larger than the normal one. Should only work in LEGACY MODE, booting via UEFI should not work. (CSM (Compatibility support Module) means compatibility module, this option is specially set for compatibility with devices that can only work in legacy mode and operating systems that do not support or fully support UEFI.)The Trojan adds its own functions to the BIOS module and hooks the normal functions of the system to execute.The normal function is as follows:3/18The Trojan hooked this function to:Change the first instruction of the original function to CALL to get an execution opportunity:4/18After that, it will judge whether the content of the R9 register is 3, which may be a sign of the successful initialization of the BIOS, and then search for the BIOS internal feature code CD 19 B8 00 80 CB 00It should be the code executed by calling interrupt INT19H to load the first sector MBR of the hard disk after the internal initialization of the BIOS. Then modify the data at 0X413, reserve 40KB space to store the Trojan code, and copy the code in the BIOS to the reserved space. And after the internal initialization of the BIOS found earlier, call the interrupt INT19H to load the code executed by the MBR of the first sector of the hard disk, and call the code of the Trojan horse itself instead.5/182.2 INT15 hook analysisThen, return to continue execution. When the BIOS is initialized and ready to load the MBR code of the disk, the code of the Trojan will be executed. At this time, the Trojan will hook the INT15H interrupt, and then resume the execution of the original code, so that the hook is completed. The follow-up is similar to the MBR Trojan of the Dark Cloud series. It hooks the memory step by step by hooking INT15H and loads itself.6/18In this way, when the system MBR is executed, the Trojan has already hung the HOOK of INT15h in the memory. After that, it will HOOK bootmgr!Archx86TransferTo64BitApplicationAsm to get the next execution opportunity, and then HOOK winload!OslArchTransferToKernel, and then HOOK when the kernel is loaded. ZwCreateSection , thus cutting into the kernel to run, and then setting the thread callback.2.3 Thread callback hookNext, the thread callback PsSetCreateThreadNotifyRoutine and the process callback PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine will be set. In the process callback, only \Process %d Create %d\\n\ is printed, and the thread callback is the key content.In the thread callback, the Trojan determines whether it is the csrss.exe process. If it is not, it skips it. If it is, it creates a system thread and inserts a worker thread to erase its own thread callback.7/182.4 Kernel thread network download codeIn the created system thread, it will wait for 1 minute to wait for the network to be ready.8/18Then it will try to use two methods to download malicious code to the kernel for execution, firstly try UDP DownLoadShellCodeByUDP, the function is to resolve [url=]www.XXXX.top [/url] [/i] domain name. Using 0xDEDE43D0 0x8080808, the two sets of DNS domain names are converted, namely which is port 8064.First use 0x3500, namely port 53, to request the domain name service, and get the address corresponding to the [url=]www.XXXX.top[/url] [/i] domain name.First request the server, ask the Shellcode length fragment size, then process the fragments one by one, and finally splicing them together.The send packet is 0x10 in length.Accept packets as:9/18The total length is 0x28, the header length is 0x10, the data part length is 0x18, and the checksum is 0xd845672a.Shellcode length is 0x1a32d, there are 0xd2 shards in total, and each shard is 0x200 in size.When using UDP to send and receive data, the data part will be checked.If the verification is successful, they will be spliced together, otherwise discarded, and then apply for non-paged memory.10/18Copy and execute the previous memory code, passing in the NT base address as a parameter.2.5 Decrypt malicious code and deliver APCOnly the header of the downloaded code can be executed, and the latter part is encrypted data, which needs to be decrypted and executed. The calling function is RtlDecompressBuffer, the size after decryption is 150728, and the decryption method is OMPRESSION_FORMAT_LZNT1.Then the populate import table is called:11/18Then call PsCreateSystemThread to create the injection thread.In thread:The first to find system process injection is spoolsv.exe.12/18Then kill the soft process:Apply for memory copy injection:13/18Insert APC injection:2.6 Execute user-level malicious download codeAfter injection, it is executed from the application layer. The code contains a DLL file, and the execution function is to apply for the memory base address.14/18Then get the base address of the Kernel32 module, follow LoadLibraryA GetProcAddress VirtualAlloc, fill the PE file import table in the memory, and execute the DllMain function after filling.A thread will be created in DllMain, the download will be executed and run, and related services will be suspended or deleted according to the control code.thread function:15/18The privilege escalation operation decrypts the download address data. The decrypted content is:Pause or delete the service according to the control code:Then run in three ways: (DLL loading, parent process injection, directly creating EXE to run)2.7 Create malicious accounts16/18Downloaded here is an EXE, the main function is to create an administrator account.screenshot:▌ 0x03 ConclusionShadow Trojans can parasitize in various versions of BIOS including UEFI motherboards, infect the BIOS boot module in a very precise and targeted manner, and implement remote control by killing the entire Windows platform, showing a high-risk, high-complexity and high-tech " Three high" features.In order to prevent spyware Trojans, 360 Security Center recommends that netizens : try to choose official channels to buy computer accessories, and enable real-time protection of security software. If you encounter suspicious situations such as slow computer startup and login interface, unfamiliar accounts in the system, and repeated virus reporting by security software, it is best to seek help from security vendors to prevent Trojan horse viruses from causing damage to personal data and property17/1818/18
