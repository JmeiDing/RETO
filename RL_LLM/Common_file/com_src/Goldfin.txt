A Persistent Campaign Targeting CIS Countries July 26, 2018Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.1SUMMARY A number of security vendors reported a series of cyber-attacks involving the use of a malware family called SOCKSBOT and claimed to be associated with CANDLEFISH (a.k.a. Patchwork, Dropping Elephant). However, as disclosed in this report, research by iDefense analysts shows that SOCKSBOT was in fact used by a threat group in an 18- month-long campaign dubbed Goldfin, spoofing financial institutions in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries since as early as February 2017 to as recently as May 2018. Based on the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) observed in this campaign, iDefense assesses with moderate confidence that the reported campaign is unlikely to be associated with CANDLEFISH.In addition, iDefense analysts have identified infrastructure overlap and the shared use of a PowerShell obfuscation technique with FIN7. Although these observations are not enough to attribute the Goldfin campaign to FIN7, iDefense assesses these to be interesting and noteworthy observations that further highlights the complex relationships that exist behind-the-scene in organized cyber crime.HOW TO USE THIS REPORTINTENDED AUDIENCEiDefense is providing information about the reported campaigns to the general iDefense customer base, with this report being intended for security operations center (SOC) analysts and engineers. Management and executive leadership may also want to use this information.HOW TO USE THIS INTELLIGENCEiDefense is providing this information so that customers are aware of the modus operandi of a highly active threat group that is targeting financial institutions for financial gain. SOC analysts and engineers can use this IA's detailed information pertaining to the workings of a malware family and indicators of compromise (IoCs) to contain or mitigate the discussed threat through monitoring or blocking. SOC analysts can use the information provided in the Analysis and Mitigation sections of this IA for hunting activities for systems that may have already been compromised. Analysts and security engineers can use the IoCs by adding them to hunting lists on endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions as well as network- and host-based blacklists to detect and deny malware implantation and command-and-control (C2) communication.Intelligence analysts may want to use the information provided in this IA to better inform their own analyses. The provided information can also help inform ongoing intelligenceCopyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.2analyses and forensic investigations, particularly for compromise discovery, damage assessment, and attribution.Management and executive leadership may use this information to assess the risks associated with the threat described herein to make operational and policy decisions accordingly.HOW THIS INTELLIGENCE HELPS ADDRESS EXISTING OR POTENTIAL THREATSKnowledge of the group's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) should help to better inform detection and response to attacks by this threat group.CAMPAIGN ANALYSISiDefense analysts came across two spear-phishing campaigns in October 2017 involving the use of a malware family publicly known as SOCKSBOT. One campaign spoofs the Halyk Bank (Exhibit 1) and another spoofs the PrivatBank (Exhibit 2):Exhibit 1: Spear-Phishing Email Spoofing Halyk BankCopyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.3Exhibit 2: Content of a Spear-Phishing E-mail Spoofing PrivatBank Shared on the Public Forum doneckforum.comAs Exhibits 1 and 2 show, both emails contain an identical message, even down to the location of the embedded hyperlinks. The only differences are the embedded URLs and the signature of the email in order to reflect the financial institution the attackers were spoofing. This information suggests some sort of phishing kit was likely used to generate the phishing emails.An approximate translation of the e-mail spoofing Halyk Bank is as follows:Subject: Notification of opening an account (Halyk Bank of Kazakhs Dear customer, an account with the People's Bank of Kazakhstan has been opened in your name, you can find detailed information in the If you did not receive an envelope with a login and password, then you need to register to access the Personal Area. In case of loss of login / password, you can register a new one in the section "Pa If in the process of work you have any questions or problems, plea se contact the Customer Service Department at the contacts listed below. Our specialists are always ready to help you.The embedded malicious hyperlinks used in the respective attacks are as follows:hxxp://halyk-bank[.]com/dog.zip hxxp://privatbank-ua[.]com/dog.zipSubsequent technical analysis of the infection chain involved led iDefense to uncover an 18-month long campaign of spoofing banks in CIS countries, with the most recent campaign observed on May 28, 2018 spoofing the Idea Bank CJSC:Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.4Exhibit 3: Spear-Phishing Email Spoofing Idea Bank CJSCThe forum member reports that two spear-phishing emails were received: one claiming to be a notification about opening an account and the other claiming to be a notification of a loan being taken out. The content of the latter email is approximately translated below:Dear client, in your name, a loan was issued to Idea Bank, for mor e details, see the attached file in which the full name and phone number of your personal loan expert is indicated, the amount and c onditions for repaying the loan. An envelope with a credit agreement was sent to your address. In c ase you did not receive the envelope, you should contact your pers In case of loss of the contract, you can restore it at the nearest branch of the bank or request a duplicate through your personal ex For any questions you are interested in, you can contact your pers onal expert or the Customer Service Department at the contacts lis ted below. Our specialists are always ready to help you. Idea Bank CJSC Phone for calls from abroad: +375 (17) 306-33-14In the attacks observed, all involved a phishing email with two embedded URLs directing the user to download a file named dog.zip. Based on the content of the e-mails and the domain names, the following banks were spoofed in this campaign:• Halyk Bank (Kazakhstan) • PrivatBank (Ukraine) Idea Bank (Belarus) •Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.5• Tejara Bank (Iran)It is also noteworthy that in both phishing kits, there are always two hyperlinks linking to the same malicious file: one in the body of the message and one at the end of the e-mail in a link called Договор (which translates to Contract).The next section details the infection chain that follows the initial download.INFECTION CHAIN ANALYSIS code is in fact hidden as comments and is dynamically deobfuscated once the script has been executed.Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.6Exhibit 5: Obfuscated Code in dog.jsOnce deobfuscated (see Exhibit 6), it is clear that the code is designed to do two things:1. To look for a running anti-virus processes, such as avp.exe (Kaspersky Antivirus).Note that some variants of the malware also search for ekrn.exe (ESET), cis.exe (Comodo) and avgnt.exe (Avira).2. To drop and execute a PowerShell script named setup.ps1. This script isgenerated based on Base64 encoded data stored in variables in the malware). The content of this script is stored in a variable named data and is Based64 encoded2. Create a cmdlet that would:a. move the script checkupdate.ps1 to the home directory for the currentPowerShell installb. establish persistence by creating a Windows service named Check forupdates, set to "delay-auto" start and execute checkupdate.ps13. Use a modified version of the function Invoke-EventVwrBypass from the EmpirePost-exploitation framework to bypass UAC and execute the above cmdletExhibit 7: Deobfuscated Code in setup.ps1Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.8STAGE 3 - POWERSHELL REFLECTIVE LOADERSimilarly, checkupdate.ps1 used in each attack has the respective MD5 compressed, Base64 encoded, and embedded within the script, which is similar to a technique used in PowerSploit.However, the observed technique appears to be a variant of PowerSploit as the encoded payload is further split into a number of chunks that are dynamically loaded into an array variable named $OArr as shown in Exhibit 8:Exhibit 8: Obfuscated Code in checkupdate.ps1The code is in fact a PowerShell reflective loader script with a dynamic-link library (DLL) binary embedded as Base64-encoded data (Exhibit 9).Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.9Exhibit 9: Deobfuscated Code in checkupdate.ps1STAGE 4 - SOCKSBOTThe specific SOCKSBOT sample analyzed in this report has the following properties:• Filename: socksbot.dll • File Size: 17.0 KB (17408 bytes) • Compiled Time Stamp: 2017-10-27 17:46:05Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.10As mentioned in the last section, the SOCKSBOT implant is typically delivered as a Base64-encoded string reflectively loaded (via the ?ReflectiveLoader@@YGKPAX@Z exported function) in a newlystarted svchost.exe process. As such, the implant exists only in memory and never touches the disk.The implant will first verify if any of the mutexes in the following format are present in order to not run twice:Global\%snps Global\%sstpExhibit 10 shows an example of a created mutex.Exhibit 10: Mutex Creation a321c0d8979a05bdnpsThe SOCKSBOT implant has the following capabilities:• Enumerate processes (process list) • Take screenshots • Download, upload, write, and execute files • Create and inject into new processes • Communicate to C2 via socketsThis implant will communicate with the designated C2 server by first creating a buffer and will, on first execution, communicate to the C2 server that it has successfully infected a target by using a.php URI that is pseudo-randomly generated. SOCKSBOTuses the ObtainUserAgentString API to determine the default user-agent of the machine.An example of a request to the C2 46.166.163[.]243 is shown in Exhibit 11.Exhibit 11: Traffic to the C2 ServerThe C2 server or the operator of the SOCKSBOT implant can then respond with a specific HTTP status code to perform a set of actions. Exhibit 12 shows this option in the implant.Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.11Exhibit 12: C2 OptionsThe following status codes are supported:• 200: create and start new socket • 202: enumerate processes and take screenshot • 203: perform a set of actions (download, upload, execute)Exhibit 13 shows an example of possible actions:Exhibit 13: HTTP Status Code 203 Return OptionsThe actions that the operator can perform are as follows:• Write and execute filesCopyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.12• Execute PowerShell scripts • Execute a PowerShell script and exitSOCKSBOT can thus write other PowerShell scripts to the %TEMP% folder and execute these hidden from the user. This is achieved with the following command:%s\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypas s -NoLogo -NonInteractive -NoProfile -WindowStyle Hidden -File "%s"This allows the attacker to upload other obfuscated PowerShell scripts on the machine 46.166.163[.]243 5.135.73[.]113INFECTION CHAIN VARIATIONSWhile the described infection chain above is the most common infection chain observed, iDefense analysts have also observed a number of different variations in related campaigns:1. SOCKSBOT Dropper 2. dog.js Obfuscation 3. Random PowerShell Script Names 4. Reflective loading PowerShell Script ObfuscationVARIATION 1: SOCKSBOT DROPPERAside from the PowerShell reflective loader, iDefense analysts have also identified a dropper executable binary with the following properties that was used to reflectively load SOCKSBOT into a chosen process (usually svchost.exe):• Filename: <random> • File Size: 23.6 KB (24200 bytes) • Compiled Time Stamp: 2017-02-01 13:40:14Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.13• Signer: Magnum Travel Club (Serial: 1F 8A 3E 60 EE C1 E3 AA 63 B3 9B DD 26E1 10 FB)Note that the binary was signed with a code-signing certificate purportedly from an organization called Magnum Travel Club.This dropper will create a copy of itself in C:\Programdata\Logs as a hidden system file and will then delete the original file. Another copy will be created in %appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup with the same properties to ensure persistence.Finally, the dropper will start a new svchost.exe process in a suspended state andconsequently reflectively load (and inject) the SOCKSBOT implant into the process.An additional Windows service may be created for persistence as well, which is done by first enumerating existing legitimate services and creating a new service spoofing one of the services with an almost identical name.In this case, a new service named Xindows Error Reporting Service was created (seeExhibit 14).Exhibit 14: Service CreationWhile this dropper does indeed load the SOCKSBOT implant, all other iterations or campaigns have used scripts, in particular JavaScript and PowerShell, to reflectively load the SOCKSBOT payload.VARIATION 2: DOG.JS OBFUSCATIONWhile most dog.js samples observed were obfuscated as reported in the infection chain section, there are also versions that were not obfuscated at all or were obfuscated using a different obfuscation technique such as different character encoding (Exhibit 15):Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.14Exhibit 15: A Different Obfuscation Technique Used in dog.js and generate a new file called ~~1.tmp in %appdata%\Futures. The script is deleted after execution.VARIATION 3: RANDOM POWERSHELL SCRIPT NAMESCertain variants of dog.js also have a new function to randomly generate file names for the second- and third-stage PowerShell scripts:function makerndps1() { var text = ""; var possible = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 0123456789"; for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) text += possible.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * possible.l ength)); return text + '.ps1'; }4. REFLECTIVE LOADING POWERSHELL SCRIPT OBFUSCATIONAside from changes to the dog.js obfuscation, iDefense analysts have also found a different obfuscation technique used to obscure the code in the reflective loading script (see Exhibit 16):Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.15Exhibit 16: Different Obfuscation Technique Used in the Reflective Loading PowerShell also that the execution command used for persistence is again encoded (see Exhibit 17):Exhibit 17: Obfuscated Execution Command in Check for update Service Used for PersistenceATTRIBUTIONBased on the preference to spoof financial institutions in CIS countries, the network infrastructure used and the observed targeting, iDefense assesses with moderate confidence that the reported campaign is unlikely to be associated with CANDLEFISH.Furthermore, iDefense analysts have identified a number of interesting and noteworthy overlaps with FIN7:•Identical WHOIS information used in domains associated with the Goldfin campaign and FIN7, as well as network hosting overlap• Shared use of a PowerShell obfuscation techniqueCopyright © 2018 Accenture Security. All rights reserved.16OVERLAP 1: IDENTICAL WHOIS INFORMATION AND NETWORK HOSTING OVERLAPResearch shows that the domains privat-bankau[.]com, halyk-bank[.]com, and tejara- bank[.]com all have the organization name Goldfin LLC, a near-identical registrantaddress (see below), and a @rambler.ru e-mail address used as the registrant e-mail address.Registrant Organization: Goldfin LLC Registrant Street: ul Arbat 5 Registrant City: Moscow Registrant State/Province: Moscow Registrant Postal Code: 115343 Registrant Country: RUThis pattern overlaps with two other domains - despanabrandfood[.]com and silverdiners[.]com (see Exhibit 18) - that iDefense current assesses with low confidence are likely associated with FIN7 due to the following:1. Spoofing restaurant chains Despaña Brand Foods (legitimate domain despanabrandfoods.com) and Silver Diner (legitimate domain silverdiners.com), a known technique associated with FIN7. The website despanabrandfood[.]com remains indexed by Google (see Exhibit 19)2. Previously resolved to the IP address 192.99.14[.]211, which was reported byTrustwave and tr1dx as associated with FIN7 towards late 2016 and early 2017. In addition, like many domains associated with FIN7 as well as the Carbanak group, many of the domains used in the Goldfin campaign were also parked at 31.41.41[.]41 which is associated with CIS Hosting. However, iDefense analysts are aware both hosts are likely to be shared/parking hosts hence the association with FIN7 based on this overlap is of low confidence.Exhibit 18: WHOIS Information Similarities between Domains Used in the Goldfin Campaign and Those Associated with FIN7Copyright © 2018 Accenture Security.

All rights reserved.18OVERLAP 2: SHARED USE OF A POWERSHELL OBFUSCATION TECHNIQUEAs mentioned in the infection chain analysis, the code embedded within the third-stage PowerShell script checkupdate.ps1 is obfuscated using a technique similar to that of PowerSploit. However, the technique used appears to be a niche variant as the embedded payload is further split into chunks and dynamically added to an array variable Interestingly, iDefense analysts have previously observed this obfuscation used in a HALFBAKED is a malware family associated with FIN7.Exhibit 21: Similar PowerShell Obfuscation Technique Used between the Goldfin Campaign and FIN7While the above overlapping features are not strong enough to be used to conclude that the Goldfin campaign is associated with FIN7, iDefense analysts believe they are significant and noteworthy and may well add to new evidence that may come to light in the future as research continues. They also highlight the complex hidden relationships that exist behind-the-scenes in organized cyber crime.MITIGATIONTo effectively defend against the threats described in this report, iDefense recommends blocking the following access URIs and IP address:blopsadmvdrl[.]com tejara-bank[.]com privat-bankau[.]comCopyright © 2018 Accenture Security.
