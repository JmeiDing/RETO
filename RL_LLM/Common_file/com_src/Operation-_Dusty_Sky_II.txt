It analyses new attacks by Molerats against targets in Israel, The United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and The Palestinian Authority.We elaborate on the scope and targeting of the DustySky campaign and expose new infrastructure and incidents. In addition, we expose the identity of an individual who is behind the DustySky campaign. Following the previous report, this individual has contacted us trying to learn what we know about him.Attacks against all targets in the Middle East stopped at once, after we published our first report. However, the attacks against targets in the Middle East (except Israel) were renewed in less than 20 days. In the beginning of April 2016, we found evidence that the attacks against Israel have been renewed as well2.Based on the type of targets, on Gaza being the source of the attacks, and on the type of information the attackers are after - we estimate with medium-high certainty that the Hamas terrorist organization3 is behind these attacks.AcknowledgmentsThis research was facilitated by the PassiveTotal for threat infrastructure analysis. We would like to thank the security researchers and organizations who shared information and provided feedback, which have been crucial for this research.1 clearskysec.com/dustysky 2 The report seems to have indeed disrupted the attacker for several months. In a PDB found in a sample from the April wave, there is an indication that the attacker saw that wave as “part 2” of the attacks (part 1 being the attacks before execute Version 1 - Doc\bin\Release\Obfuscated\News.pdb 3 url All Rights reserved to C.S.

It is composed of a DustySky dropper, DustySky core, and the DustySky keylogging component. It has been developed and used since May 2015 by Molerats (aka "Gaza cybergang"), a terrorist group whose main objective in this campaign is intelligence gathering.A wave of malicious email messages has been sent on a weekly basis to hundreds of targets. The email message and the lure documents are written in Hebrew, Arabic or English. The attackers would send a malicious email message that either links to an archive file (RAR or ZIP compressed) or has one attached to it. The archive contains an .exe file, sometimes disguised as a Microsoft Word file, a video, or another file format, using the corresponding icon. We have also found samples that use Microsoft Word files embeded with a malicious macro, which would infect the victim if enabled. In all cases the attackers rely on social engineering - convincing the victim to open the file (and enabling content if it is disabled) - and not on software vulnerabilitiesIn addition to DustySky, the attackers use publicly available tools such as the following Remote Administration Tools (RAT): Poison ivy, Nano Core, XtremeRAT, DarkComet and Spy-Net. These tools have been used either following an initial DustySky infection, or by themselves.Targeted sectors are mostly governmental and diplomatic institutions including embassies; companies from the aerospace and defense Industries; financial institutions; journalists; software developers.Most targets are from the Middle East, some are in the United States and Europe.In January 2016 we've published an extensive report about the campaign and malware - “Operation DustySky” - which is available here: clearskysec.com/dustysky______________________________________________________________________________(C) All Rights reserved to C.S.

The content of the document is always copied from an online public source. The subject usually revolves around defense and security or current affairs. Once in a while other topics or content are used - such as a public corporate responsibility document published by Egged, an Israeli bus company; a part of an online Novel published as a doc file; or pornographic materials.Intelligence agencies succeeding in penetrating Hezbollah.exeIDF survey Research Center______________________________________________________________________________(C) All Rights reserved to C.S.

The shortened link statistics page enables us to learn about the scope and the targeting of this threat actor.We can see that the link was clicked 210 times, out of which 130 were in Israel, 32 in the United States, 9 in the Palestinian authority, and 39 from 12 other countries (1-5 each).The statistics do not necessarily reflect the exact distribution of targets: one target may click more than one time; a proxy or VPN may skew the country count; and security researchers and bots may also comprise part of the clicks. However, they do roughly represent the scope of the campaign: tens to few hundreds of recipients - mostly in Israel, the United States and the Palestinian Territories.This corresponds to the distribution we know of based on other sources such as direct reports from targets, cases we have investigated, and open source intelligence.______________________________________________________________________________(C) All Rights reserved to C.S.

The rest of the email accounts were in organizations - both private and governmental.______________________________________________________________________________(C) All Rights reserved to C.S.

For example, one of the command and control servers, mafy.2waky[.]com, serves content copied from a legitimate unrelated website - radaronline.com. The copied content is probably there just to confuse suspecting targets and security researchers.In other cases, the visitor was redirected via HTTP 301 response to a legitimate unrelated website - below, we can see that new hosts/domains (marked by orange triangle) have pointed to it during January- hostnames, and dozens of known unique malware samples. However, it has not been technologically advanced, and the infrastructure and attacks have not been operated professionally.Open directories were often left on delivery servers. Traces were left on infected systems and abused email accounts. Malware delivery was often predictable, contained spelling mistakes or even irrelevant lure documents, and were easy to identify. Most importantly, the attacker forgot to cover his trails, enabling us to learn his identity.Threat actorIn the beginning of December 2015, three samples were submitted to online malware detection and analysis platforms malwr.com and Virus Total. The samples were Word documents with a macro version of DustySky. They were submitted on the same date they were last saved.The person who last saved the documents (after weaponizing them with the malicious macro) forgot to clear the file metadata. Thus, the “Last Saved By” properties of the documents contained his username: moayy2ad@hotmail.com led the following blog7, which has been removed in the months after we published made private following our publication.Searching for the same username in Gmail (moayy2ad@gmail.com) yielded further results. A Google+ profile8 with a similar nickname – Mo’ay - was connected to this address. The profile has also been disabled in the months after we published the first report.8 url All Rights reserved to C.S. Consultings Ltd, 2016.

In the app’s page we learn that he uses the name Mo'ayyad Ay and that he is from Gaza”In the YouTube channel10 linked to moayy2ad@gmail.com (which, like the other accounts, has been made private later), the individual has uploaded anti-Israeli propaganda videos:9 url 10 url All Rights reserved to C.S.

Consequently, the attacker contacted us, trying to learn what we know about him.By EmailEleven days after we publicly published “Operation DustySky”, we received the following email13 url %D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9-542062199177072/______________________________________________________________________________(C) All Rights reserved to C.S. Consultings Ltd, 2016. "ClearSky" www.clearskysec.comPage 22 of 26We immediately recognized the email as a fake – coming from an unofficial address - idf.cyber@gmail.com – and written in English.The email, allegedly sent by the “Israeli Defense Force cyber team”, asked for undisclosed information we had about the culprit behind DustySky (the email referred to a statement in the first report in which we wrote that “we have decided not to disclose this individual’s name in the public report”).By phoneFew days later, we were contacted again, this time by phone. The caller pretended to be an official in one of the effected countries mentioned in the report. Similarly, he asked for further information about the identity of the attacker. We asked the caller to send his request via email. Corroborating the provided contact information, we learned that this was also a fake.In both cases, we did not send any information to the attackers.
