Unlike largely indiscriminate attacks that focus on stealing credit card and banking information associated with cybercrime, targeted attacks noticeably differ and are better characterized as “cyber espionage.” Highly targeted attacks are computer intrusions threat actors stage in order to aggressively pursue and compromise specific targets, often leveraging social engineering, in order to maintain persistent presence within the victim’s network so they can move laterally and extract sensitive information.1Cyber-espionage campaigns often focus on specific industries or communities of interest in addition to a geographic focus. Different positions of visibility often yield additional sets of targets pursued by the same threat actors. We have been tracking the campaign dubbed “Luckycat” and found that in addition to targeting Indian military research institutions, as previously revealed by Symantec, the same campaign targeted entities in Japan as well as the Tibetan community.3The Luckycat campaign targeted the following industries and/or communities:In a typical targeted attack, a target receives a contextually relevant email that encourages a potential victim to click a link or open a file.2 The links and files the attackers send contain malicious code that exploits vulnerabilities in popular software. The exploits’ payload is a malware that is silently executed on the target’s computer. This exploitation allows the attackers to take control of and obtain data from the compromised computer. In other cases, the attackers send disguised executable files, usually compressed in archives that, if opened, also compromise the target’s computer. The malware connects back to command-and-control (C&C) servers under the attackers’ control from which they can command the compromised computer to download additional malware and tools that allow them to move laterally throughout the target’s network. These attacks are, however, not isolated “smash-and-grab” incidents but are part of consistent campaigns that aim to establish covert presence in a target’s network so that information can be extracted as needed.Targeted attacks are rarely isolated events. In fact, they are constant. It is more useful to think of them as campaigns—a series of failed and successful attempts to compromise a target’s network over a certain period of time. The attackers, in fact, often keep track of the different attacks within a campaign in order to determine which individual attack compromised a specific victim’s network. As the attackers learn more about their targets from open source research—relying on publicly available information, as well as previous attacks, the specificity of the attacks may sharply increase.• Aerospace• Shipping• Energy• Military research• Engineering• Tibetan activistsThe Luckycat campaign attacked a diverse set of targets using a variety of malware, some of which have been linked to other cyber-espionage campaigns. The attackers behind this campaign maintain a diverse set of C&C infrastructure and leverages anonymity tools to obfuscate their operations. We were able to track elements of this campaign to hackers based in China.Diversity of targetsThe Luckycat campaign, which has been active since at least June 2011, has been linked to 90 attacks against targets in Japan and India as well as Tibetan activists. Each malware attack involves a unique campaign code that can be used to track which victims were compromised by which malware attack. This illustrates that the attackers are both very aggressive and continually target their intended victims. These are not smash-and-grab attacks but constitute a “campaign” comprising a series of ongoing attacks over time. In sum, the Luckycat campaign managed to compromise 233 computers.41 url intelligence/white-papers/wp_trends-in-targeted-attacks.pdf3 url Targeted attacks can sometimes be conducted through instant4 This number represents the unique MAC addresses of the victims thatmessages instead of emails.were stored by the attackers on their C&C infrastructure.PAGE 1 | LUCKYCAT REDUXDiversity of MalwareoperationsWe were able to identify five malware families either utilized by or hosted on the same dedicated server the Luckycat campaign uses. Some were used as second- stage malware that the attackers pushed to victims whose networks were compromised by first-stage malware. Second-stage malware typically provide additional functionality and are especially used if the first-stage malware prove very simplistic. In addition, we found that the attackers used multiple malware families that coincide with malware that have been used in other campaigns. This indicates a level of collaboration across campaigns.TROJ_WIMMIE, favored by the Luckycat attackers, bundles a significant amount of information on the victim and uploads it to a C&C server. One such file recovered from a C&C server is actually the result of a test run by the attackers. The information reveals that the attackers use proxy and anonymity tools to shield their identities as well as a variety of mailing programs to instigate targeted attacks. In addition, the language settings of the attackers’ computers indicate that they are Chinese speakers. This is consistent with the information Symantec obtained, which shows that the attackers logged in to their C&C server from IP addresses allocated to China.Diversity of infrastructureattributionThe Luckycat campaign use free web-hosting services that provide a diversity of domain names as well as IP addresses. This distributes the campaign, making it more difficult to track. However, the attackers also made use of Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) that not only housed their primary malware—TROJ_WIMMIE, but others as well.5 These servers may also act as anchors, as servers on free hosting services are shut down for malicious activity. As a result, the campaign stabilized its infrastructure over time, transferring victims, often through the use of second- stage malware, from free hosting servers to their stable core of VPSs.Using open source research, we were able to connect the email address used to register one of the Luckycat C&C servers to a hacker in the Chinese underground community. He uses the nickname, “dang0102,” and has published posts in the famous hacker forum, XFocus, as well as recruited others to join a research project on network attack and defense at the Information Security Institute of the Sichuan University. The hacker, also known as “scuhkr,” has authored articles related to backdoors and shellcode in a hacking magazine.5 VPSs are dedicated hosting services that can be purchased online.PAGE 2 | LUCKYCAT REDUXLUCKYCATThe malware used in the Luckycat campaign, detected by Trend Micro as TROJ_WIMMIE6 or VBS_WIMMIE,7 connects to a C&C server via HTTP over port 80. It is notable because it uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)8 to establish persistence.9 VBS_WIMMIE registers a script that works as a backdoor to the WMI event handler and deletes files associated with it or TROJ_WIMMIE. As a result, the backdoor cannot be detected by antivirus software through simple file scanning.The compromised computer posts data to a PHP script that runs on the C&C server, usually count.php.The attacker then creates a file with a name that ends in @.c, which contains a command.[HOSTNAME]_[MAC_ADDRESS]_[CAMPAIGN_ CODE]@.cThe compromised computer then downloads the file and executes the specified command, which may include any of the following:• Download file• Upload file• Get external IP address• Execute shell commandPOST/count/count.php?m=c&n=[HOSTNAME]_ [MAC_ADDRESS]_[CAMPAIGN_CODE]@HTTP/1.0 Accept: */* UA-CPU: x86 User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729) Host: [HOSTNAME] Content-Length: 0 Connection: Keep-Alive Pragma: no-cacheThe initial communication results in the creation of a file on the C&C server that contains information on the compromised computer. Although the file is empty, the file name contains the hostname of the compromised computer, followed by its MAC address, along with the campaign code the attackers use to identify which malware attack caused the compromise:~[HOSTNAME]_[MAC_ADDRESS]_[CAMPAIGN_CODE]The compromised computer then sends the output to the C&C server and deletes the command file:POST/count/count.php?m=w&n=[HOST_NAME]_ [MAC_ADDRESS]_[CAMPAIGN_CODE]@@.t HTTP/1.0 POST/count/count.php?m=d&n=[HOST_NAME]_ [MAC_ADDRESS]_[CAMPAIGN_CODE]@@.c HTTP/1.0One of the common initial commands instructs the compromised computer to upload the results of information-gathering commands. This command causes the compromised computer to create a directory listing of the available drives, along with the output of the commands, “ipconfig,” “tasklist,” and “systeminfo.” The resulting files are compressed using the CAB compression format and uploaded to the C&C server. This provides the attackers a full set of information to evaluate the nature of the compromised computer.6 url url The Luckycat malware may be notable but its technique is no longernew, as the WMI malware featured in the paper cited below also exhibited the same capability.9 url 3 | LUCKYCAT REDUXexaMples of luckycat attacksExample 1: JapanExample 2: IndiaFigure 1: Decoy document opened after exploiting an Adobe Reader vulnerabilityA targeted email was sent to some organizations in Japan. One of the attacks occurred during the confusion after the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant accident. The attackers used the disaster to lure potential victims into opening a malicious .PDF attachment. The .PDF file exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Reader—CVE-2010-2883, in order to drop TROJ_WIMMIE onto the target’s system.10 This malware communicated with a Luckycat C&C server. The decoy document contains the radiation dose measurement results, which were published on the Tokyo Power Electric Company (TEPCO) website.11Figure 2: Redacted decoy document opened after exploiting a Microsoft Word vulnerabilityA malicious document containing information on India’s ballistic missile defense program was used to lure potential victims into opening it. This document contains malicious code that exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office—CVE- 2010-3333, to drop TROJ_WIMMIE onto a compromised system so this would connect to a C&C server the Luckycat hackers operate.1210 url 11 url 4 | LUCKYCAT REDUX12 url 3: TibetFigure 3: Decoy document opened after exploiting a Microsoft Office vulnerabilityMalicious emails and .DOC attachments that leverage Tibetan themes in order to trick recipients into opening them have been found. This particular sample exploits the same vulnerability in Microsoft Office—CVE-2010-3333, to drop TROJ_WIMMIE onto the target’s system so it would communicate back to a C&C server the Luckycat hackers operate.VULNERABILITIES AND MALWARE SAMPLESMost of the samples we have seen exploited CVE-2010- 3333. Dubbed the “Rich Text Format (RTF) Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability,” this causes a buffer overflow in the Microsoft Word RTF parser when the “pFragments” shape property is given a malformed value.To verify the exploitation, one should look out for the following keywords:• pFragments: Seen after the string, “\sn”• \sv: Exploit code is seen after thisThe typical structure of the malicious RTF document is:{\rtf1{\shp{\sp{\sn pFragments}{\sv “exploit code”}}}}The rest of the samples we found exploited the following vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader and Flash Player:• CVE-2010-2883:	Adobe Reader TTF SING tableparsing vulnerability• CVE-2010-3654:	Adobe Flash Player AVM2 multi-namebutton class vulnerability13• CVE-2011-0611:	Adobe Flash Player AVM1 shared objecttype vulnerability14• CVE-2011-2462:	Adobe Reader U3D componentvulnerability1513 url 14 url CVE-2010-3654 CVE-2011-0611CVE-2010-2883 CVE-2010-3654 CVE-2010-3654 CVE-2011-0611CVE-2010-2883 CVE-2010-3654 CVE-2011-0611Campaign Code can be used to track which systems were compromised by which attack. The campaign codes often contain dates that indicate when each malware attack was launched. This demonstrates how actively and frequently the attackers launched attacks. The campaign codes also reveal the attackers’ intent, as some of these referenced the intended targets.

In fact, these appear to use dedicated VPS services.DomainEmail Addressclbest.greenglassint.net19013788@qq.combailianlan.c.dwyu.comdayinok@qq.comduojee.infoduojeewei@qq.comTable 3: C&C servers that the attackers hosted on VPSsWe also found advertisements for VPS services using two of the C&C server IP addresses in Table 3. While the VPS services were advertised in Chinese forums, the servers were actually hosted in the United States.Figure 4: Sample ads for the VPS services the attackers useThe diversity of C&C hosting services used provided the attackers a resilient infrastructure. If one server, for instance, was shut down for malicious activity, they can easily create more servers. As victims of interest are identified, they can also be easily moved from free hosting servers to C&C servers set up on more stable VPSs. The domain and geographic diversity of the IP addresses also helped mask the attackers’ locations.COMMAND AND CONTROLThe Luckycat campaign extensively use free hosting services. We recorded the domains the attackers used as well as the email addresses they utilized to register the domains, if available. While the domains, including their suffixes, were considerably diverse, all were available from three different free hosting services. As such, the attackers had nothing to lose but time in order to continue creating diverse domain names for C&C servers.DomainEmail Addresscattree.1x.bizcharlesbrain.shop.colindagreen56@rediffmail.comyamagami_2011@mail.goo. ne.jpfootballworldcup.website.orgajayalpna@hotmail.comfrankwhales.shop.cohi21222325.x.ggyamagami_2011@mail.goo. ne.jphi2122325@hotmail.comkinkeechow.shop.cokinkee_chow@mail.goo.ne.jpkittyshop.kilu.orgperfect.shop.copbdelhioffice@gmail.comdsang72@yahoo.compumasports.website.orgranjitrai123@hotmail.comtomsburs.shop.coyamagami_2011@mail.goo. ne.jpvpoasport.shopping2000.com beenznair@gmail.comgoodwell.all.co.ukpaltry.parrot@googlemail.comfireequipment.website.orgshrivastava.agrim@gmail.comtennissport.website.orgmanindramohanshukla@ yahoo.comwaterpool.website.orgjaganacharya@hotmail.comtb123.xoomsite.comtbda123.gwchost.comtoms.0fees.nettomygreen.0fees.netkillmannets.0fees.netmaritimemaster.kilu.orgmasterchoice.shop.cojeepvihecle.shop.colucysmith.0fees.netTable 2: Free web-hosting service domains the attackers used forC&C serversPAGE 8 | LUCKYCAT REDUXOPERATIONSThe threat actors behind the Luckycat campaign tested one of their malware samples on a computer under their control. In the process, they uploaded down.cab, which contains a command that creates a directory listing of the available drives on a compromised system, along with the output of the commands, “ipconfig,” “tasklist,” and “systeminfo.” We were able to download this file from the C&C server. While it does not reveal the attackers’ identities, it does provide an inside view of their operations.The result of the “systeminfo” command indicates that the attackers tested the malware in a virtual environment. The environment was set up using a Chinese-language version of Windows XP.Figure 5: Sample system information the attackers obtained after testing on a virtual machine (VM)We found that the product ID of the Windows XP software used was posted online in the past. It was a pirated Windows XP version that was made available for purchase in China.Figure 6: Sample ads for the pirated Windows XP version usedWhile the rest of the information we gathered did not reveal significant clues due to the use of a VM, we found that the attackers left a shared drive—D:\, which was indexed by the malware. The index was then uploaded to the C&C server.Figure 7: Drive left available by the attackers that contains C&C scripts and victim informationPAGE 9 | LUCKYCAT REDUXIn one of the directories—ccclllmmmm, we found that the attackers put a copy of the count.php C&C backend as well as a list of the victims and the contents of their computers. We were also able to find that the C&C server the attackers used was a victim’s computer.Figure 9: Anonymity tools the attackers had on the shared D:\ driveThe attackers also had mailing software such as FoxMail and Supermailer on the shared D:\ drive. While these tools are not malicious, the attackers used these to easily send out socially engineered emails. These also allowed them to keep track of their various identities and email accounts. One of the samples we obtained used the Chinese- language version of FoxMail.The attackers clearly have operational procedures in place to obscure their true locations with the aid of anonymity tools. They also have a virtualized environment set up to test and fine-tune their malware as well as the necessary tools to maintain their various identities and send out socially engineered emails with malicious attachments.Figure 8: Victim information on the attackers’ C&C server that is identical to the the information on the attackers’ shared D:\ driveTo ensure operational security, the attackers installed Tor and Tunnelier. Some of the email samples with malware attachments, in fact, sent through Yahoo! Mail used Tor. The use of this anonymity tool allowed the attackers to obscure their IP addresses, making it increasingly difficult for researchers to pinpoint their locations.PAGE 10 | LUCKYCAT REDUXATTRIBUTIONAdditional clues concerning the attackers had to with the email address, 19013788@qq.com, which was used to register one of the C&C servers, clbest.greenglassint. net. This email address can be mapped to the QQ number, 19013788. QQ is popular instant-messaging (IM) software in China. This QQ number is linked to a hacker in the Chinese underground community who goes by the nickname, “dang0102,” and has published posts in the famous hacker forum, XFocus, in 2005.Figure 10: Sample post by dang0102 using the QQ number, 19013788Figure 11: Post by schuhkr using the QQ number, 19013788The same hacker also published a post on a student BBS of the Sichuan University using the nickname, “scuhkr,” in 2005. He wanted to recruit 2–4 students to a network attack and defense research project at the Information Security Institute of the Sichuan University then. Scuhkr also authored articles related to backdoors and shellcode in a hacking magazine that same year.16The post in Figure 11 contains two email addresses— ggggggsccd@sina.com and scuhkr@21cn.com, along with an additional QQ number, 2888111. The email address, scuhkr@21cn.com, is also associated with an account on rootkit.com.17 Investigating the second QQ number allowed us to determine that scuhkr also used the nickname, “lolibaso.” The other individual mentioned in the post also worked and studied at the Information Security Institute of the Sichuan University and has published several articles related to “fuzzing” vulnerabilities in 2006.16 url url 11 | LUCKYCAT REDUXCAMPAIGN CONNECTIONSWe were able to identify five malware families that were either used by or hosted on the same dedicated server with the domain name, duojee.info. Some of these were used as second-stage malware that the attackers pushed to victims whose systems have been compromised by first- stage malware. Second-stage malware typically provided additional functionality and were especially used if the first-stage malware is very simplistic. We also found that the attackers used several malware families that have been utilized in previous campaigns. This may indicate a level of collaboration across campaigns.shaDownetThe first interesting connection we noticed in conjunction with the Luckycat campaign had to do with ShadowNet, a cyber-espionage network documented by researchers at the University of Toronto and the ShadowServer Foundation.18 We found a socially engineered email that had two malicious file attachments.Figure 12: Sample targeted email with both Luckycat and ShadowNet malware attachments18 url 12 | LUCKYCAT REDUXOne of the sample email’s attachments was part of the Luckycat campaign while the other was part of the ShadowNet campaign. The ShadowNet campaign has a history of targeting Tibetan activists as well as the Indian government, which fits the profile of the Luckycat campaigns as well.Figure 13: Relationship between the Luckycat and the ShadowNet campaignsThe ShadowNet malware, detected by Trend Micro as TROJ_GUPD.AB, first connects to a blog in order to receive the URL of the C&C server. The URL was encoded using a modulus operation. The malware on the compromised computer decodes the URL then issues a connection to the C&C server. The compromised computer posts data to a PHP script running on the server, usually named index. php or all.php, and contains information about it as well as a campaign code.The information is stored in a .TXT file on the C&C server. The compromised computer continues to beacon to the C&C server to see if the operators have designed any commands. If they have, the compromised computer then executes the given commands and reports the results back to the C&C server.Figure 14: Sample ShadowNet malware related to a Luckycat email attackThis attack used the theme of self-immolation in Tibet for both the email and the decoy document that is opened after the vulnerability exploitation. The malicious file attachment exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office— CVE-2010-3333, to drop malware onto the target’s system. The malware was configured to connect to two blogs and a Yahoo! Group in order to find the C&C server’s location.Figure 15: Example of a blog used by ShadowNet to communicate an encoded C&C server locationThe blogs and groups the ShadowNet attackers use can be easily updated whenever the C&C servers are changed. The URL of the blog is embedded in the malware. The malware connects to the blog and decodes the C&C URL then connects to the C&C server. The commands the server issues are also encoded using a simple logical operator. The malware also decodes these using keycodes duojee.info. We also found that a malware binary available for download from duojee.info is a TROJ_WIMMIE Trojan that connects back to bailianlan.c.dwyu.com—a C&C server the Luckycat attackers use.PAGE 13 | LUCKYCAT REDUXFigure 16: Relationship between the Duojeen and the Luckycat campaignsThe duojee.info server is the C&C component of the Duojeen campaign. The related malware, detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_DUOJEEN.A, connects to a C&C server and posts data to a PHP script typically named, linux.php, solaris.php, or freebsd.php. The following information is encoded using logical operators such as xor, or, or bitwise shifting on adjacent bytes in the malware:The Duojeen malware continues to poll the C&C server then executes one of the only possible commands specified by the attackers:• Stop the malware from communicating with the C&Cserver• Download and execute a second-stage malware• Hostname• Computer name• MAC address•IP address, subnet mask, and gateway• Network resources• Running processes• Microsoft Outlook user account information (e.g., HTTPmail user name, POP3 user name, or POP3 server)Figure 17: Sample Duojeen attack email• Recently opened filesPAGE 14 | LUCKYCAT REDUXOne of the Duojeen attacks leverages a Tibetan-themed job ad to encourage potential victims to open an attached document that exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office—CVE-2010-3333, in order to drop a malware that connects to aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaTable 5: Duojeen malware samplesDuojee.info also contains the PHP scripts used for commanding and controlling the Luckycat campaign at /holly/count.php as well as ShadowNet at /soom/cont.php. The duojee.info server also has a phishing page designed to steal passwords from mail.tibet.net users.Figure 18: Phishing page hosted on duojee.infoThe duojee.info server also has other malware from two additional families available for download. One malware is known as “Comfoo,” related to yet another cyber-espionage campaign, while the other is known as “Sparksrv.”sparksrvSparksrv refers to a second-stage malware that provides backdoor access with significantly more functionality than first-stage droppers. Second-stage malware, often Remote Administration Trojans (RATs), are deployed because first-stage malware only provide simple “check-in” functionality such as a short list of commands that can be scheduled. Second-stage RATs, on the other hand, provide an additional access channel as well as “real-time” control over a compromised machine if the attackers and the victims are online at the same time.Figure 19: Relationship between the Sparksrv and the Luckycat campaignsThe Sparksrv malware, detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_ RPKNUF.A, was initially found on a ShadowNet server in November 2011. We have, however, found several instances of a newer version of the same malware on duojee. info. The malware initially sends the following plain-text information through port 443:•IP address•Identifier• MAC addressPAGE 15 | LUCKYCAT REDUXOnce the malware establishes a connection, it then starts to receive commands from the C&C server, which allow the campaigns targeting sensitive entities in both Japan and India. We found a version of the Comfoo malware on the duojee.info server as well as an email attack that used the same version of Comfoo malware. In fact, the .DOC file used in the attack dropped an .EXE file with the same MD5 hash as the one found on the duojee.info server.Figure 20: Relationship between the Comfoo and the Luckycat campaignsPAGE 16 | LUCKYCAT REDUXWhile at least two of the Comfoo variants are essentially the same, the traffic encryption methods used in the Comfoo sample found in connection with duojee.info differed from other Comfoo variants we’ve analyzed that are not directly related to the Luckycat campaign. The more common Comfoo malware samples we analyzed used custom encryption methods while the variant found on the duojee.info server utilized the Windows Cryptographic Application Programming Interface (API). This Comfoo variant’s initial network communication sent the following information to the C&C server:• Randomly generated characters• MAC address•IP address• OS version• String, “liberate,” as campaign codeThe attackers gather the following information from infected systems:• CPU, NETBIOS, and disk information• System, OS version, and account information• Network adapters, protocols, and configurationinformation•Installed applications as well as Internet Explorer (IE) and Browser Helper Object (BHO) informationThe malware the attackers use is capable of receiving several commands.CommandDescription0x233C0x1B6C0x139C0x1F540xFDC0xFF00xBCC0xBE0Invoke command shellTake screenshotStart interactive desktopStart keyloggingStop serviceDelete serviceEnumerate running processesTerminate process0x2EF4Download fileTable 8: Commands the Comfoo malware receiveFigure 21: Sample Comfoo campaign emailThis Comfoo email attack leverages the current situation in Tibet to encourage recipients to open a malicious attachment that exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Office—CVE-2010-3333, in order to drop a malware onto the target’s system.Figure 22: Comfoo decoy document that exploits a Microsoft Office vulnerabilityAfter the decoy document opens, the Comfoo malware begins to communicate with johnnees.rkntils.10dig.net, host that some Sparksrv malware samples we analyzed making the scope of the problem truly global. These have been affecting governments, militaries, defense industries, high-technology companies, intergovernmental organizations, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), media organizations, academic institutions, and activists worldwide.Targeted attacks are not isolated smash-and-grab incidents. They are part of consistent campaigns that aim to establish persistent, covert presence in a target’s network so that information can be extracted as needed.Targeted attacks may not be easy to understand but careful monitoring allows researchers to leverage the mistakes attackers make to get a glimpse inside their operations. Moreover, we can track cyber-espionage campaigns over time using a combination of technical and contextual indicators.This paper specifically discussed the Luckycat campaign. In the course of our research, we discovered that it had a much more diverse target set than previously thought. Not only did the attackers target military research institutions in India, as earlier disclosed by Symantec, they also targeted sensitive entities in Japan and India as well as Tibetan activists. They used a diversity of infrastructure as well, ranging from throw-away free-hosting sites to dedicated VPSs.We also found that the Luckycat campaign can be linked to other campaigns as well. The people behind it used or provided infrastructure for other campaigns that have also been linked to past targeted attacks such as the previously documented ShadowNet campaign.19Understanding the attack tools, techniques, and infrastructure used in the Luckycat campaign as well as how an individual incident is related to a broader campaign provides the context necessary for us to assess its impact and come up with defensive strategies in order to protect our customers.Sufficiently motivated threat actors can penetrate even networks that use moderately advanced security measures. As such, apart from standard and relevant attack prevention measures and mechanisms such as solid patch management; endpoint and network security; firewall use; and the like, enterprises should also focus on detecting and mitigating attacks. Moreover, data loss prevention (DLP) strategies such as identifying exactly what an organization is protecting and taking into account the context of data use should be employed.local anD external threat intelligenceThreat intelligence refers to indicators that can be used to identify the tools, tactics, and procedures threat actors engaging in targeted attacks utilize. Both external and local threat intelligence is crucial for developing the ability to detect attacks early. The following are the core components of this defense strategy:• Enhanced visibility: Logs from endpoint, server,and network monitoring are an important and often underused resource that can be aggregated to provide a view of the activities within an organization that can be processed for anomalous behaviors that can indicate a targeted attack.• Integrity checks: In order to maintain persistence,malware will make modifications to the file system and registry. Monitoring such changes can indicate the presence of malware.• Empowering the human analyst: Humans are bestpositioned to identify anomalous behaviors when presented with a view of aggregated logs from across a network. This information is used in conjunction with custom alerts based on the local and external threat intelligence available.19 url 19 | LUCKYCAT REDUXTechnologies available today such as Deep Discovery provide visibility, insight, and control over networks to defend against targeted threats.20 Deep Discovery uniquely detects and identifies evasive threats in real time and provides in-depth analysis and actionable intelligence to prevent, discover, and reduce risks.Mitigation anD cleanup strategyOnce an attack is identified, the cleanup strategy should focus on the following objectives:• Determine the attack vector and cut offcommunications with the C&C server.• Determine the scope of the compromise.• Assess the damage by analyzing the data and forensicartifacts available on compromised machines.Remediation should be applied soon afterward, which includes steps to fortify affected servers, machines, or devices into secure states, informed in part by how the compromised machines were infiltrated.eDucating eMployees against social engineeringSecurity-related policies and procedures combined with education and training programs are essential components of defense. Traditional training methods can be fortified by simulations and exercises using real spear-phishing attempts sent to test employees. Employees trained to expect targeted attacks are better positioned to report potential threats and constitute an important source of threat intelligence.Data-centric protection strategyThe ultimate objective of targeted attacks is to acquire sensitive data. As such, DLP strategies that focus on identifying and protecting confidential information are critical. Enhanced data protection and visibility across an enterprise provides the ability to control access to sensitive data as well as monitor and log successful and unsuccessful attempts to access it. Enhanced access control and logging capabilities allow security analysts to locate and investigate anomalies, respond to incidents, and initiate remediation strategies and damage assessment.20 url 20 | LUCKYCAT REDUXTREND MICRO THREAT PROTECTION AGAINST LUCKYCAT CAMPAIGN COMPONENTSThe following table summarizes the Trend Micro solutions for the components of the Luckycat campaign.

Unlike indiscriminate cybercrime attacks, spam, web threats, and the like, APTs are much harder to detect because of the targeted nature of related components and techniques. Also, while cybercrime focuses on stealing credit card and banking information to gain profit, APTs are better thought of as cyber espionage.LUCKYCATFirst SeenIndividual targeted attacks are not one-off attempts. Attackers continually try to get inside the target’s network.The Luckycat campaign has been active since at least June 2011.Victims and TargetsAPT campaigns target specific industries or communities of interest in specific regions.The Luckycat campaign has been linked to 90 attacks against the following industries and/or communities in Japan and India:AEROSPACE ENERGY ENGINEERING SHIPPING MILITARY RESEARCH TIBETAN ACTIVISTSThe threat actors behind the Luckycat campaign used a unique campaign code to track victims of specific attacks.OperationsThe 1st-stage computer intrusions often use social engineering. Attackers custom-fit attacks to their targets.»»»»»Targeted emails that are contextually relevant (i.e., emails containing a decoy document of radiation dose measurement results sent some time after the Great East Japan Earthquake)Exploited CVE-2010-3333 (aka, Rich Text Format [RTF] Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability) in several instances, although Adobe Reader and Flash Player vulnerabilities were also exploitedUsed TROJ_WIMMIE or VBS_WIMMIE—malware that take advantage of the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), making the backdoor component undetectable through file scanningThe WIMMIE malware, once inside the network, connects to a command-and-control (C&C) server via HTTP over port 80Attackers heavily used free web-hosting services to host their C&C servers under a diverse set of domain names but also used virtual private servers (VPSs) for more stable operationsPossible Indicators of CompromiseAttackers want to remain undetected as long as possible. A key characteristic of these attacks is stealth.WIMMIE malware do not leave much network fingerprint.
