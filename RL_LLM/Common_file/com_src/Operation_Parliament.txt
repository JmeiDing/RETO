Review of the year. Overall statistics for 2016Kaspersky Security Bulletin. Predictions for 2017Kaspersky Security Bulletin 2015. Evolution of cyber threats in the corporate sectorKaspersky Lab has been tracking a series of attacks utilizing unknown malware since early 2017 . T he attacks appear to be geopolitically motivated and target high profile organizations. T he objective of the attacks is clearly espionage – they involve gaining access to top legislative, executive and judicial bodies around the world.1. T he attackers have targeted a large number of organizations globally since early 2017 , with themain focus on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), especially Palestine. High-profile organizations have also been targeted in other regions. T he number of attacks has decreased since the beginning of 2018.2. T he attacks were initially discovered while investigating a phishing attack that targeted political figures in the MENA region. At first the attacks looked to be the work of the low-sophistication Gaza Cybergang (decoys, file names), but further analysis painted a very different picture.3. T argets include high-profile entities such as parliaments, senates, top state offices and officials,political science scholars, military and intelligence agencies, ministries, media outlets, research centers, election commissions, Olympic organizations, large trading companies, and other unknown entities.4. T he malware basically provides a remote CMD/PowerShell terminal for the attackers, enablingthem to execute any scripts/commands and receive the result via HT T P requests.5. Kaspersky Lab users and T hreat Management and Defense clients are protected from the attacks.Save web pages as PDF with PDFmyURLCisco T alos recently published a blogpost describing targeted attacks in the Middle East region which we believe may be connected.Victimology and Statistics Victimology and StatisticsBased on our findings, we believe the attackers represent a previously unknown geopolitically motivated threat actor. T he campaign started in 2017 , with the attackers doing just enough to achieve their goals. T hey most likely have access to additional tools when needed and appear to have access to an elaborate database of contacts in sensitive organizations and personnel worldwide, especially of vulnerable and non-trained staff. T he victim systems range from personal desktop or laptop systems to large servers with domain controller roles or similar. T he nature of the targeted ministries varied, including those responsible for telecommunications, health, energy, justice, finance and so on.Victims have been spotted in the Palestinian T erritories, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Djibouti, Qatar, Lebanon, Chile, Somalia, Iraq, Morocco, Syria, India, Iran, Canada, the USA, the UK, Germany, Israel, Afghanistan, Serbia, Russia, Oman, Kuwait, South Korea and Denmark.Vict im o r ganiz at io n t ype Vict im o r ganiz at io n t ypeUnknownSenates/ParliamentsPrime Ministerial OfficesMilitary/Intelligence AgenciesOther Gov./Ministerial/DiplomaticOfficesFinancial/Banking InstitutionsMedia OutletsOlympic/Sports BodiesResearch Centers/ScholarsElection CommissionsNum be r o f vict im Num be r o f vict imo r ganiz at io ns o r ganiz at io ns917352052221Save web pages as PDF with PDFmyURLDistribution/Logistics1T he number of victims/victim organizations probably doesn’t represent the full scope of the attacks – only a portion.Attack description and attribution Attack description and attributionOperation Parliament appears to be another symptom of escalating tensions in the Middle East region. T he attackers have taken great care to stay under the radar, imitating another attack group in the region. T hey have been particularly careful to verify victim devices before proceeding with the infection, safeguarding their command and control servers. T he targeting seems to have slowed down since the beginning of 2018, probably winding down when the desired data or access wasSave web pages as PDF with PDFmyURLobtained. T he targeting of specific victims is unlike previously seen behavior in regional campaigns by Gaza Cybergang or Desert Falcons and points to an elaborate information-gathering exercise that was carried out before the attacks (physical and/or digital).With deception and false flags increasingly being employed by threat actors, attribution is a hard and complicated task that requires solid evidence, especially in complex regions such as the Middle East.See the following for more information and examples of false flags being used in cyberattacks:Wave your false flags! …or the Nightmares and Nuances of a Self-Aware Attribution SpaceOlympicDestroyer is here to trick the industryMalware description Malware descriptionT he malware was first seen packed with VMProtect; when unpacked the sample didn’t show any similarities with previously known malware. All the strings and settings were encrypted and obfuscated. Functionality was identified that enables HT T P communication with the C&C server and invokes “processcreate” based on parameters received as a response.T he configuration and strings are encrypted using 3DES and Base64 encoding. Data sent to the C&C server is also encrypted using 3DES and Base64. Different keys are used for local and network encryption.T he malware starts communicating with the C&C server by sending basic information about the infected machine. T he C&C server then replies with the encrypted serialized configuration.T he malware basically provides a remote CMD/PowerShell terminal for the attackers, enabling them to execute scripts/commands and receive the results via HT T P requests.Save web pages as PDF with PDFmyURLSample of the C&C response with encrypted commands and configurations Sample of the C&C response with encrypted commands and configurationsExamples of attack decoys Examples of attack decoysTranslation: Contacts list of media personnel Translation: Contacts list of media personnelSave web pages as PDF with PDFmyURLTranslation: Relations between UAE and Jordan, and the impact caused by the non-boycott Translation: Relations between UAE and Jordan, and the impact caused by the non-boycottof Qatar of QatarSave web pages as PDF with PDFmyURLTranslation: Military retirement statement 2017 June Translation: Military retirement statement 2017 JuneSave web pages as PDF with PDFmyURLTranslation: The new Hamas structure for Gaza strip 2017 Translation: The new Hamas structure for Gaza strip 2017Save web pages as PDF with PDFmyURLTranslation: Clarification report (on Gaza employee salaries) Translation: Clarification report (on Gaza employee salaries)What should high-proﬁle organizations What should high-proﬁle organizations do?do?High-profile organizations should have elevated levels of cybersecurity. Attacks against them are inevitable and are unlikely to ever cease. T hese organizations need to pay particular attention to their security, implementing additional measures to ensure they are well protected. Anti-targeted attack solutions, threat intelligence capabilities and data flows, default-deny application lockdown, endpoint detection and response, data leak and insider threat prevention, and even isolated/air-gapped networks should form the basis of any strategy for protecting organizations in the current threat landscape.Save web pages as PDF with PDFmyURLT he victims of Operation Parliament need to re-evaluate their approach to cybersecurity.Additional information Additional informationFor more information about the attacks and the indicators of compromise, please contact: intelreports@kaspersky.comAlternatively, please visit: url o find more information about cybersecurity awareness training for enterprise or government staff, go to Kaspersky Security Awareness.APT CYBER ESPIONAGE T ARGET ED AT T ACKShare post on:  Related Posts Related PostsAPT Trends report Q1 2018Your new friend, KLaraMasha and these BearsLEAVE A REPLY LEAVE A REPLY Your e mail addre ss will not be publishe d.
