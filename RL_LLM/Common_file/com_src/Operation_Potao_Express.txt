a cyber-espionage toolkitRobert Lipovsky, Anton CherepanovEXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Operation Potao Express whitepaper presents ESET’s latest findings based on research into the Win32/Potao malware family. Even though the malware was detected long ago by ESET and a few other anti-virus companies, it hasn’t received any public attention since 2011, when the first known samples were detected.Like BlackEnergy (a.k.a. Sandworm, Quedagh), Potao is an example of targeted espionage (APT) malware detected mostly in Ukraine and a number of other CIS countries, including Russia, Georgia and Belarus.Among the victims that we were able to identify, the most notable high-value targets include Ukrainian government and military entities and one of the major Ukrainian news agencies. The malware was also used to spy on members of MMM, a financial pyramid scheme popular in Russia and Ukraine.One of the most interesting discoveries during our Potao investigation and research was the connection to a Russian version of the now discontinued popular open-source encryption software, TrueCrypt. The website truecryptrussia.ru has been serving a Russian language localized version of the TrueCrypt application that also contains a backdoor, in some specific cases. The trojanized version of the application is only served to selected victims which is another indicator of targeting by the malware operators and also one the reasons why the backdoor has gone unnoticed for such a long time. In addition to serving trojanized TrueCrypt, the domain also acted as a C&C server for the backdoor. The connection to Potao lies in the fact that Win32/Potao has been downloaded in a few cases by Win32/FakeTC (ESET detection name of the trojanized encryption software).This paper also gives additional technical details on the Win32/Potao malware family and its spreading mechanisms, and describes the most noteworthy attack campaigns.1INTRODUCTION This report gives details on a large number of attacks1 that have been going on for the past 5 years. The (seemingly) unrelated campaigns were all conducted using the Win32/Potao malware family. Similarly to BlackEnergy, the malware family used by the so-called Sandworm group, the Potao malware is a universal modular cyber-espionage toolkit. The attacks where it was employed were of the targeted (APT) type but there were also several cases where we detected the trojan in mass- spreading campaigns.The countries most targeted by Potao, a malware family most probably of Russian origin, are Ukraine, Russia and Georgia, with some notable high-value targets.Our paper presents a timeline of the various campaigns, focusing on the spreading vectors and then provides a technical analysis of the Win32/Potao trojan. We also analyze Win32/FakeTC – a trojanized version of the popular open-source encryption software, TrueCrypt. The listed Indicators of Compromise include sample hashes, domain names, and C&C IP addresses.1) The title of this whitepaper, Operation Potao Express, is derived from the Win32/Potao malware family – the common denominator in all of thedescribed cyberattacks and from websites used in the postal-service campaigns.2CONTENTS Executive Summary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 List of figures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 Attack timeline . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .5Campaigns in 2011 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6The MMM campaigns . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7A wedding invitation in Georgia . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9Shift of focus to Ukraine. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .9Postal-service campaigns . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .10Attacks against Ukrainian government and military . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .13TrueCrypt Russia . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .14Georgian campaign . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 Win32/Potao – Technical Analysis 15Infection vectors & persistence . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .16Win32/Potao – Architecture . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17Plugins overview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .18C&C communication protocol . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .19Spreading via USB . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22Win32/Potao anti-reverse engineering techniques. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .23Win32/FakeTC – Fake TrueCrypt Analysis. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

One of the reasons why no comprehensive research on this family has been published until today might be the fact that between 2011 and 2013 the number of detections was relatively low. A significant rise in malware prevalence was observed by ESET LiveGrid® in 2014 and 2015 (Figure 1).400350300250200150100500Russia Belarus2012201320142015Figure 1 – Detection statistics for Win32/Potao according to ESET LiveGridWe omitted detection statistics for 2011 from the chart above because at that time the malware appeared to spread as regular crimeware, i.e. it was spreading in many different countries and these waves were most probably unrelated to the targeted and semi-targeted attacks seen in the subsequent years. Debugging versions detected in 2013 are also excluded from the chart.Many of the Potao campaigns in the past bear the characteristics of a targeted attack (APT). Yet, interestingly, the same malware family was also used in mass infections detected on a large number of seemingly unrelated hosts. While this hybrid approach to malware dissemination might seem strange, it has been observed before. The BlackEnergy trojan, for example, was used in targeted attacks against certain high-profile targets but its spreading went beyond just the few targeted organizations2. Similarly, the ‘outbreak’ of Stuxnet was the reason why the notorious malware was discovered, although in that case, by mistake. From our analysis of Potao campaigns over the past five years, it seems that the mass-spread infections were used to test and debug the trojan in preparation for upcoming targeted attacks. Similar debug runs of new versions of targeted malware by massively infecting a wide range of ‘test victims’ is an interesting but not uncommon technique used by professional APT groups.The main reason for the increase in Potao detections in 2014 and 2015 were infections through USB drives.2) Either as collateral damage, or for unknown reasons.51st Potao appearance MAY 2011Georgian campaign OCT 2013Georgian campaign JUL 2015Fake TrueCrypt1st appearance APR 2012Grandtorg certi(cid:31)cate granted and subsequently revoked AUG 2014USB Spreading1st appearance OCT 2013high prevalence SEP 2014 -201120122013201420152016MMM Campaigns APR - JUN 2012Armenian Campaign AUG 2011WordAirpost.net JUN 2015MNTExpress MAR 2014WordAirpost.com MAR 2015debug versions SEP 2013Shift to focus to UkraineAttacks against government and military MAR 2015Figure 2 – Timeline of selected Potao campaignsThe timeline in Figure 2 lists a selection of Potao attack campaigns and other important events, according to dates when they were first detected by ESET, or by the compilation timestamps in the binaries. A more comprehensive listing of representative campaigns, with their compilation timestamps, unique campaign IDs3 and malware version numbers can be found in Appendix B.Let’s take a closer look at some of the more significant campaigns.Campaigns in 2011 The first Potao campaign that we examined took place in August 2011. It was a mass-spreading campaign4. The binaries used in this campaign contained an encrypted string: GlobalPotao, hence the name of the malware family.The infection technique used by the first campaign, and also by campaigns in the following years, was trivial, yet effective. The Potao trojan-droppers arrived (commonly via phishing emails) at victims’ systems in the form of executables with the icon of a Microsoft Word document, to trick the users into opening them and thereby running the malware. No software exploits were needed. Apart from the malicious payload, the droppers usually also contained a decoy document that was displayed to the victim.5Figure 3 – Example decoy document from the first Potao campaigns3) The Campaign IDs are unique text strings used to identify individual infections or infection attempts by the Potao malware operators. Thecombinations of letters and numbers used can sometimes reveal information about the campaign and targets. For example, a campaign with the Campaign ID perm was detected in the Russian province of Perm, campaigns labeled mmmL and NMMM were most likely related to tracking members of the MMM Ponzi scheme, and so on.4) The outbreak of early Win32/Potao versions is mentioned in this Cisco alert 5) This technique is a common one, also used by other malware groups and to spread other malware families, for example Korplug (PlugX).6Potao droppers in another campaign detected in 2011 were using a decoy document in the Armenian language. Interestingly, the decoy was a legitimate document that belonged to the Armenian Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.Figure 4 – Armenian Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs document used as decoy in 2011 campaignThe MMM campaigns MMM is one of the world’s largest Ponzi schemes of all time. We won’t go into details about the Russian financial pyramid and its author, as these can easily be found online.Binaries in the first detected MMM-related Potao campaign had a compilation timestamp April 27, 2012 and a campaign ID 00km. The social-engineered decoy document pretends to be from someone wanting to join the pyramid scheme:Figure 5 – Decoy document from 1st MMM-related campaign7A loose translation of the Russian text:… I do business in the construction industry.I’d like to invest about 500k rubles. I want to invest with a highest yield. I hope you will help me.Another campaign detected not long after the first one used decoy documents with random Cyrillic characters. As we discovered later, the use of documents that appear corrupted, because of the garbage text used, seems to be a kind of trademark for this group.Figure 6 – Decoy document from another MMM-related campaignThe file name in the example above was Отчет о выплате Ковалевой Александре.exe (Payment report for Kovaleva Alexandra) and this time, the campaign ID actually confirms the connection to the Ponzi scheme: mmmL.On June 19, 2012, Sergei Mavrodi, the inventor of MMM, stated in a blog post that someone trying to impersonate him was sending out spear phishing emails to members of MMM that contained a link to malware hosted on Dropbox.Figure 7 – Warning announcement on Sergei Mavrodi’s blog8Figure 8 – Win32/Potao hosted on DropboxThe filenames used were Анкета и правила or anketa_i_pravidla (Questionnaire and rules), compilation timestamp June 13, 2012 and campaign ID NMMM.The specific targeting of these campaigns suggests that the operators of the Potao malware toolkit were trying to track or spy on members and/or organizers of the financial pyramid scheme.A wedding invitation in Georgia In 2013 the Potao malware was also detected in Georgia. The file, compiled on October 15, 2013, was named Wedding_invitation.exe and showed the victim a decoy wedding invitation. It is interesting to note that both the file name and the wedding invitation were in English.Figure 9 – Georgian decoy wedding invitationShift of focus to Ukraine Before we observed a rise in Win32/Potao detections in Ukraine in 2014, ESET detected several debug versions of the malware in autumn 2013. We can assume that this was in preparation for the Ukrainian targeted attacks.9Figure 10 – Debug versions of Win32/Potao6One of the campaign IDs in these debug waves was krim (Russian for Crimea).Postal-service campaigns In March 2014, the gang behind Potao started using a new infection vector. They created a malicious landing webpage called MNTExpress. The website was apparently inspired by the site of the legitimate Russian postal service Pony Express.Figure 11 – Legitimate Pony Express website6) The text strings shown in the screenshot are not present in regular release versions of the trojan.Figure 12 – Fraudulent MNTExpress website10Posing as a parcel tracking receipt or an invoice is a very common technique for spreading malware. Instructions to download the malicious bait are usually sent in waves of phishing emails. The Potao gang, however, used a different approach. The targets of their interest were sent an SMS message that contained a link to the fraudulent landing webpage, along with a specific tracking code and the recipient’s name. This approach indicates very specific targeting of the attacks, since:• The attackers had prior knowledge of the victims’ full names and their cellphone numbers. • The delivered binaries were tailored to the victim. In order to download a sample of Win32/Potao,it was necessary to enter a specific tracking code into the web form.Figure 14 shows a recipient inquiring about the SMS on a Vkontakte discussion forum:Figure 13 – Spear-phishing SMSFigure 14 – SMS recipient seeking information on discussion forum11The same infection scenario was used approximately one year later, in March 2015. This time, the attackers registered the domain WorldAirPost.com and the website design was stolen from Singapore Post. Curiously, the attackers changed the Singapore Post logo to “Italy Post”:Figure 15 – Legitimate website of Singapore Post’s Speedpost serviceFigure 16 – Fraudulent WorldAirPost.com websiteAt the time of writing the attackers are still active, having registered WorldAirPost.net in June 2015. It is also interesting to note that while the MNTExpress websites contained both Russian and English language mutations, WorldAirPost was only in English.12Interestingly, the Potao droppers served in these campaigns were not disguised as Word documents but Excel spreadsheets. Also, instead of popping up a decoy document, a fake “excuse” dialog box is shown (Figure 17):Figure 17 – Pop-up message “explaining” why no Excel document was openedAttacks against Ukrainian government and military Since March 2015, ESET has detected Potao binaries at several high-value Ukrainian targets that include government and military entities and one of the major Ukrainian news agencies. The infection vector used in these attack waves was again an executable with a MS Word document icon and this time cleverly chosen filenames to increase the likelihood that the recipient would open the bait:“Table of prisoners of Ukrainian armed forces on 05.03.2015”“Exempted military persons between 06.09.2014 and 05.03.2015”“Exempted from captivity for Chief of the General Staff on 05.03.2015”“List of captured during the ATO on 05.03.2015”Figure 18 – Potao droppers with MS Word icons and file names to attract the recipients‘ interest7The topics in the file names correspond to the fact that government and military officials were targeted. The decoy documents displayed once again appeared corrupted.Figure 19 – One of the corrupted-looking decoy documents from March 5, 20157) The acronym ‘ATO’ refers to ‘Anti Terrorist Operation’ in Eastern Ukraine. The same theme was used to spread the BlackEnergy trojan.13TrueCrypt Russia During our monitoring of the Potao botnet, we discovered infections that originated from a rather suspiciously-named trojan dropper and an even more suspicious website.We found out that instances of Win32/Potao were being launched by a dropper named TrueCrypt. exe. That wouldn’t be too surprising, since malware operators often use file names that resemble legitimate applications, but in this case the dropper was a binary of the actual, now discontinued, TrueCrypt encryption software. Investigating further, we discovered that not only was the Potao malware installed by a trojanized version of TrueCrypt but it had also been downloaded from the website truecryptrussia ru, which offers downloads of the abovementioned TrueCrypt binaries. Finally, we discovered that the domain in question was also used as a malware C&C server, and thus truecryptrussia.ru being a fraudulent website operated by the attackers seems to be the likelier explanation than merely being a legitimate website compromised by them.To sum it up, the website and software of “TrueCrypt Russia” was found guilty of:1. Hosting trojanized (backdoored) versions of the TrueCrypt encryption software.(See the Win32/FakeTC section for a technical analysis of the backdoor.)2. Hosting the Win32/Potao malware. 3. Acting as a C&C server for abovementioned trojanized TrueCrypt.Note, however, that not every download of the TrueCrypt software from the Russian website is malicious or contains a backdoor. The malicious versions of the software are served only to selected visitors, based on unknown specific criteria. This lends additional evidence to the view that the operation is run by a professional gang that selectively targets their espionage victims.Figure 20 – Website of TrueCrypt RussiaAccording to ESET’s LiveGrid® telemetry, the Russian TrueCrypt website has been serving malware since at least June 2012. The served binaries‘ timestamps date the earliest trojans to April 2012.14Georgian campaign As confirmation that the malware writers are still very active even at the time of this writing, ESET detected a new Potao sample compiled on July 20, 2015. The file was targeted (and detected) against a victim in Georgia. Unlike the previous campaigns, the displayed decoy was not a Word document but a PDF file.Figure 21 – Georgian decoy documentWIN32/POTAO – TECHNICAL ANALYSIS In this section we’ll describe the technical aspects of the Win32/Potao trojan, from the malware architecture, C&C communication, analysis of plugins, and description of infection vectors, including USB spreading functionality, to the anti-reverse engineering techniques used.From a functional, high-level perspective, the malware family shares many common characteristics with the BlackEnergy trojan. A feature comparison with BlackEnergy can be found in Appendix A and Indicators of Compromise (IoC) are listed in Appendix C. The following paragraphs present an overview of Win32/Potao functionality, focusing on its unique features.Before we move on to the actual analysis of the malware, let’s look at where the family got its name. The malware binaries from the first detected campaign contained an encrypted string GlobalPotao. In other samples of the same family that ESET detected throughout the years, the malware has also gone by the names Sapotao and node69 as seen in its own DLL filenames names and PDB paths left inside the binaries:15Figure 22 – PDB paths containing “Potao”, “sapotao” and “node69”The Potao family is a typical cyberespionage trojan, and as such it implements all the necessary functionality to exfiltrate sensitive information from the infected user’s system and send it to the attackers’ remote server.Infection vectors & persistence Similarly to most other trojan families, Win32/Potao arrives at the victim’s computer system in the form of a trojan dropper that acts as an “installer” for the malware. We have observed several infection vectors used to distribute the trojan, as described in the Attack timeline section. To summarize:• Executables masquerading as Word, Excel, and PDF documents. These were propagated throughfake postal service websites and SMS links, and possibly also through phishing emails• Worm-like USB spreading functionality • Fake TrueCrypt software – see Win32/FakeTC for the technical analysis The dropper itself is usually in two stages. The first stage, for example, in the form of an executable with an icon of a MS Word document, merely drops the second stage dropper into the %temp% directory, executes it, and at the same time drops the embedded decoy document into the current working directory and opens it.The second stage dropper unpacks the main DLL from within itself using RtlDecompressBuffer. The DLL is dropped to the following path, loaded and injected into explorer.exe:%APPDATA%\Microsoft\%LUID%.dll8Before the DLL is dropped to the drive, however, a simple trick is applied. The Potao dropper patches the name of the Enter export function in the DLL file’s export address table to the LUID value. Figure 23 shows the patching function and an example where Enter was renamed to _85fc. As a result, every dropped instance of the DLL will have a unique binary hash.8) %LUID% signifies the LUID structure, which is used as a unique identifier for the infected bot16Figure 23 – Patch of export function name before dropping the main DLLThe trojan uses standard methods for loading its DLL – via rundll32.exe – and for maintaining persistence, by setting the Run registry entry:[HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run] %LUID%Win32/Potao – Architecture The Potao trojan features a modular architecture and its functionality can be expanded with additional downloadable plugins.pluginpluginpluginexplorer.exechrome.exe uTorrent.exesafari.exeC&C\\.\pipe\\%name%Figure 24 – Win32/Potao architecture17When the malware is installed, its main DLL will be injected into the explorer.exe process. After having passed a mutex check, this instance will try to inject itself into the address space of several running legitimate and Internet-facing processes (browsers, Skype and uTorrent). With this setup, the instance injected within explorer.exe is responsible for loading and communicating with the Potao plugins, while the instances within the Internet-facing processes takes care of communication with the C&C server. The two instances communicate via a named pipe.Plugins overview The Potao main DLL only takes care of its core functionality; the actual spying functions are implemented in the form of downloadable modules. The plugins are downloaded each time the malware starts, since they aren’t stored on the hard drive.Win32/Potao supports two types of plugins. The first type is Full Plugin9 and its export function is called Plug. The second is Light Plugin with an export function Scan. The difference between the two types is how they execute and return desired information. Full plugins run continuously until the infected system is restarted, while Light plugins terminate immediately after returning a buffer with the information they harvested off the victim’s machine.It is worth mentioning that some of the plugins we observed during our monitoring of the Potao botnet were signed with a certificate issued to “Grandtorg”:Figure 25 – GrandTorg certificate detailsThe name “Grand Torg” sounds like “Great Market” in Russian, a rather common term; we weren’t able to identify an institution with that name. The certificate Serial Number is: 0453B96EB039AFD6C9988C8CB698E7C9 and its effective Revocation Time: Aug 19 00:00:00 2014 GMTSince the Revocation Time is the same as the Valid from time, all signatures made with this certificate have been rendered invalid after the revocation request was issued. This strongly suggests that the certificate has only been used for nefarious purposes, as opposed to having been stolen from a legitimate company.Table 1 contains a list of Potao plugins that we have encountered10.9) “Full Plugin” and “Light Plugin” are terms used by the actual malware authors in debug builds of the trojan. 10) It is quite possible that we have not seen all existing plugins, so the list may be incomplete.18FilenameGetAllSystemInfo.dllType LightGetAllSystemInfo.dllLightFilePathStealer.dllFulltask-diskscanner.dllFullKeyLog2Runner.dllFullPasswordStealer.dllLightScreen.dll Poker2.dllloader-updater.dllLight LightLightDescriptionCollects various kinds of system information, including: system identifying information, proxy and language settings, lists of processes, installed software, recently opened files, and so on.

It looks for document extensions and common history, settings and cookie files belonging to Internet browsers. After the search, the found files are sent to the C&C. Logs key strokes & clipboard data from most common Internet browsers and Skype. Decrypts and steals passwords and settings from different browsers and email clients. Captures screenshots. Disables spreading through USB drives, deletes specific Registry keys, and kills processes belonging to the malware. Updates the trojan.Table 1 – Win32/Potao pluginsC&C communication protocol The Win32/Potao samples that we’ve analyzed contained several different C&C IP addresses encrypted in their bodies. For example one sample had the following hard-coded list of IPs, after connection. As can be seen from the ports in the list above, the HTTP or HTTPs protocols can be used for communication with the remote server.The communication uses strong cryptography in two stages. The first stage is the key exchange and the second stage is the actual exchange of data. This simple yet secure communication scheme is explained in Figure 26.19MALWAREhas embeded in its code:RSA(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:10) public keyconnection attemptC&C SERVERpossesses:RSA(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:10) private keyveriﬁes the signature with the RSA(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:10) public keyRSA(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:10) public keyobtains newRSA(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:10) public keygenerates newAES(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:129)(cid:141) symmetric keyencrypts it with the new RSA(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:10) public keyAES(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:129)(cid:141) symmetric keyRSA(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:10) public keyRSA(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:10) private keyRSA(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:10) public keydecrypts it with its RSA(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:10) private keyAES(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:129)(cid:141) symmetric keyobtains theAES(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:129)(cid:141) symmetric keyencrypts the request data with AES(cid:14)(cid:13)(cid:129)(cid:141) symmetric key(cid:20)(cid:19)decrypts the request dataREQUEST DATA(cid:20)(cid:2)REQUEST DATAFigure 26 – Potao key exchange and C&C communication scheme20When the malware first contacts the C&C server (1) it sends a POST-request as shown in the example in Figure 27. The data sent is encapsulated using the XML-RPC protocol. Interestingly, the used methodName value 10a7d030-1a61-11e3-beea-001c42e2a08b is always present in Potao traffic that we’ve analyzed.Figure 27 – Initial POST request sent to C&CAfter receiving the request the C&C server generates an RSA-2048 public key (2) and signs this generated key with another, static RSA-2048 private key (3). Figure 28 shows an example server response (4):Figure 28 – C&C server response with base64-encoded RSA-2048-signed generated RSA-2048 public keyWhen the malware receives this new RSA-2048 key it performs a signature verification using a corresponding static public key, which is embedded in the binary (5). If the signature is correct then the newly-received generated public key (6) will be used to encrypt the next step in communication.21The embedded static RSA-2048 public key:-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- fBUFiDQFj5DijnZJfeR/Jb/DD9oRT+UJNeV1KIQeLZDUFHkC+Vp837roAprSyJpR 005EtiBgSQ7KO9GSKqxqzE5htdMX74n4kwmw/vRGi/c66a7/XlvCW1l0SWxowXO0 -----END PUBLIC KEY----- In the second stage the malware generates a symmetric AES-256 key (7). This AES session key is encrypted with the newly received RSA-2048 public key (8) and sent to the C&C server (9). The actual data exchange (13) after the key exchange is then encrypted using symmetric cryptography, which is faster, with the AES-256 key (12).Leaving aside the trojan’s implementation of cryptography the actual communication protocol is very simple. The malware sends an encrypted request to the server, as illustrated by the following (decrypted) example:id=4699807581825067201mapt&code=0&sdata=ver:5.1.2600 lv:2.8.0002 comp:COMPUTER adm:1 x:0 p:firefox.exe&md5=&dlen=0This request contains a computer ID, campaign ID, OS version, version of malware, computer name, current privileges, OS architecture (64 or 32bits) and also the name of the current process.The server responds with the following data:code=%CMD%&data=%PAYLOAD_BASE64_ENCODED%&dlen=%PAYLOAD_LENGTH%&md5=%MD5%The code value represents the type of command that the bot is instructed to execute. The possible commands are listed in Table 2:Command2 0 or 8 or any otherDescriptionDrop executable to %TEMP% and execute via CreateProcess function Execute plugin module Drop executable to %TEMP% and execute via ShellExecuteEx function Dummy commandTable 2 – Win32/Potao C&C commandsSpreading via USB In several spreading campaigns, the Potao gang has used an additional vector to disseminate the malware: through USB drives.While so-called Autorun-worms11 used to be quite common, Win32/Potao took a different approach to USB infections. Instead of dropping an autorun.inf file to the root folder of removable drives, the USB spreading component of Potao uses a different, simple yet effective trick to store its executable on the USB media. The code responsible for USB infections will copy the Win32/Potao dropper into the root directory of all removable media drives. The filename is selected to match the disk label and the icon for removable media devices is used. At the same time, all other files and folders that were already present on the drive have their attributes set to Hidden and System.11) Worms that misused the Windows AutoPlay functionality through autorun.inf files22Figure 29 – Trick for spreading via USB removable mediaIn effect, with the default Windows settings of hiding file extensions, the user will only see a disk drive icon with the same label as the actual USB drive in Windows Explorer. This social engineering trick has fooled a number of victims into “willingly” running the malware.Win32/Potao anti-reverse engineering techniques The Potao trojan implements several tricks to make the analysis of the malware harder for reverse- engineers. One of them is using hashes of WinAPI functions instead of their names:Figure 30 – Loading WinAPI functions through hashesThis trick is commonly used among various malware families in different implementations; the Potao malware uses the MurmurHash2 algorithm for computing the hashes of the API function names.Another trick implemented in the malware is encryption of strings. The decompiled decryption algorithm is shown in Figure 31.23Figure 31 – String decryption algorithmThe strings are encrypted using an XOR operation with 4-byte length key. This key may be different in different samples.WIN32/FAKETC – FAKE TRUECRYPT ANALYSIS The malware described in this section is a different family altogether from Win32/Potao. In this section we describe how the trojanized version of the open-source TrueCrypt software is used to exfiltrate files from the espionage victims’ encrypted drives. The relation to Potao is explained in an earlier section of the whitepaper.Figure 32 – Win32/FakeTC detections by country since June 2015, according to ESET LiveGrid24Figure 33 shows the interface of the trojanized Russian TrueCrypt application.Figure 33 – Trojanized Russian TrueCryptThe malicious program code within the otherwise functional TrueCrypt software runs in its own thread. This thread, created at the end of the Mount function, enumerates files on the mounted encrypted drive, and if certain conditions are met, it connects to the C&C server, ready to execute commands from the attackers.The backdoor functionality is only contained within the application’s GUI modules; the digitally signed TrueCrypt drivers remained intact.The conditions that must be satisfied before the bot contacts the C&C server for commands are:• The number of files on the encrypted drive has to be greater than 10 • The encrypted drive must have been mounted at least 4 times The available commands are listed in Table 3:CommandDescriptionidle rdSleep for 1 second Collect Windows version, Computer name, Username Enumerate files on all disks (skipping C:\Windows and *.exe, *.dll) Enumerate files on mounted container Steal password for encrypted container Steal file Steal file by mask Download and execute file Download and execute DLL file (plugin) without storing on diskTable 3 – Win32/FakeTC C&C commands25As can be seen from the available commands, the Win32/FakeTC malware is a fully featured espionage trojan with the ability to extend its capabilities with downloadable plugins. Also, the implemented stealth techniques – serving the trojanized version only to selected targets, and only activating the malicious functionality for active, long-term TrueCrypt users – are probably the reasons why the malware has been undetected for so long.CONCLUSION In the previous pages we have presented our findings based on ESET detection telemetry and our analysis of Win32/Potao and Win32/FakeTC samples. Potao is another example of targeted espionage malware, a so-called APT, to use the popular buzzword, although technically the malware is not particularly advanced or sophisticated.On the contrary, the Potao gang has demonstrated that long-running, effective cyber-espionage can be carried out through carefully devised tricks and social-engineering, without the need for exploits. Examples of notable Potao dissemination techniques, some of which were previously unseen, or at least relatively uncommon, include the use of highly-targeted spear-phishing SMS messages to drive potential victims to malware download sites and USB worm functionality that tricked the user into ‘willingly’ executing the trojan.But perhaps the most intriguing discovery was the connection to the trojanized Russian version of popular TrueCrypt encryption software and the truecryptrussia.ru website that both served TrueCrypt with an added backdoor to selected targets, and also acted as a malware C&C server.All of the findings presented in this paper indicate very “APT-like” behavior and specific targeting of victims by the Potao operators. The open question remains: who might be interested in spying on both Ukrainian government and military entities, a news agency, members of a Ponzi scheme popular in Russia and Ukraine, and other victims – known and unidentified?Since we don’t like to speculate without hard evidence, we’ll leave the question of attribution for an open discussion. Nevertheless, the facts are that several high-value Ukrainian targets were targeted by the malware, along with a significant number of victims in other CIS countries, including Russia.26APPENDIX A – COMPARISON WITH BLACKENERGY (THE TROJAN USED BY THE SANDWORM / QUEDAGH GROUP)1st appearance Win32/Rootkit.BlackEnergySapotao, node69 Targeted, mass-spreading debug versionsUkraine, Russia, GeorgiaSandworm, Quedagh Targeted, but also detected on computers of a large number of victims Ukraine, PolandUkrainian government & military institutions, news agency, members of MMM pyramid scheme, and others Spear-phishing, SMS, postal websites, executables masquerading as Word or Excel docs, USB worm, trojanized TrueCryptUkrainian government & military institutions, companies and individuals in Ukraine and Poland Spear-phishing, documents with exploits (RTF CVE-2014-1761, PPTS CVE-2014-4114, …), executables masquerading as Word or Excel docs, parasitic virus, network spreading, infected Juniper installers, Java, TeamViewer, …Architecture Discovered plugins File stealer, system informationModular with downloadable plugins Modular with downloadable pluginscollector, password stealer, screen grabber, key logger, malware updater, USB worm componentUse of exploits noTrojanized TrueCrypt, USB spreading mechanism, DLL export function name patchC&C communication encryptionAES and RSA-2048File stealer, system information collector, password stealer, screen grabber, key logger, malware updater, network discovery & remote execution, parasitic infector, system destroyer, remote login, and so on.
