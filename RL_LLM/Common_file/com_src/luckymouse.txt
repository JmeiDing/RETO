What happened?In March 2018 we detected an ongoing campaign targeting a national data center in the Central Asia that we believe has been active since autumn 2017 . T he choice of target made this campaign especially significant – it meant the attackers gained access to a wide range of government resources at one fell swoop. We believe this access was abused, for example, by inserting malicious scripts in the country’s official websites in order to conduct watering hole attacks.T he operators used the HyperBro T rojan as their last-stage in-memory remote administration tool (RAT ). T he timestamps for these modules are from December 2017 until January 2018. T he anti- detection launcher and decompressor make extensive use of Metasploit’s shikata_ ga_ nai encoder as well as LZNT 1 compression.Kaspersky Lab products detect the different artifacts used in this campaign with the following verdicts: T rojan.Win32.Generic, T rojan-Downloader.Win32.Upatre and Backdoor.Win32.HyperBro.

Who’s behind it?Due to tools and tactics in use we attribute the campaign to LuckyMouse Chinese-speaking actor (also known as EmissaryPanda and APT 27 ). Also the C2 domain update.iaacstudio[.]com was previously used in their campaigns. T he tools found in this campaign, such as the HyperBro T rojan, are regularly used by a variety of Chinese-speaking actors. Regarding Metasploit’s shikata_ ga_ nai encoder – although it’s available for everyone and couldn’t be the basis for attribution, we know this encoder has been used by LuckyMouse previously.Government entities, including the Central Asian ones also were a target for this actor before. Due to LuckyMouse’s ongoing waterholing of government websites and the corresponding dates, we suspect that one of the aims of this campaign is to access web pages via the data center and inject JavaScripts into them.How did the malware spread? How did the malware spread?T he initial infection vector used in the attack against the data center is unclear. Even when we observed LuckyMouse using weaponized documents with CVE-2017 -118822 (Microsoft Office Equation Editor, widely used by Chinese-speaking actors since December 2017 ), we can´t prove they were related to this particular attack. It’s possible the actor used a waterhole to infect data center employees.T he main C2 used in this campaign is bbs.sonypsps[.]com, which resolved to IP-address, that belongs to the Ukrainian ISP network, held by a Mikrotik router using firmware version 6.34.4 (from March 2016) with SMBv1 on board. We suspect this router was hacked as part of the campaign in order to process the malware’s HT T P requests. T he Sonypsps[.]com domain was last updated using GoDaddy on 2017 -05-05 until 2019-03-13.Convert webpages or entire websites to PDF - PDFmyURL!FMikrotik router with two-year-old firmware and SMBv1 on board used in this campaign FMikrotik router with two-year-old firmware and SMBv1 on board used in this campaignIn March 2017 , Wikileaks published details about an exploit affecting Mikrotik called ChimayRed. According to the documentation, however, it doesn’t work for firmware versions higher than 6.30. T his router uses version 6.34.T here were traces of HyperBro in the infected data center from mid-November 2017 . Shortly after that different users in the country started being redirected to the malicious domain update.iaacstudio[.]com as a result of the waterholing of government websites. T hese events suggest that the data center infected with HyperBro and the waterholing campaign are connected.What did the malware do in the data What did the malware do in the data center? center?Convert webpages or entire websites to PDF - PDFmyURL!Anti-detection stages.

Different colors show the three dropped modules: legit app (blue),launcher (green), and decompressor with the Trojan embedded (red) launcher (green), and decompressor with the Trojan embedded (red)T he initial module drops three files that are typical for Chinese-speaking actors: a legit Symantec pcAnywhere (IntgStat.exe) for DLL side loading, a .dll launcher (pcalocalresloader.dll) and the last- stage decompressor (thumb.db). As a result of all these steps, the last-stage T rojan is injected into svchost.exe’s process memory.T he launcher module, obfuscated with the notorious Metasploit’s shikata_ ga_ nai encoder, is the same for all the droppers. T he resulting deobfuscated code performs typical side loading: it patches pcAnywhere’s image in memory at its entry point. T he patched code jumps back to the decryptor’s second shikata_ ga_ nai iteration, but this time as part of the whitelisted application.T his Metasploit’s encoder obfuscates the last part of the launcher’s code, which in turn resolves theConvert webpages or entire websites to PDF - PDFmyURL!necessary API and maps thumb.db into the same process’s (pcAnywhere) memory. T he first instructions in the mapped thumb.db are for a new shikata_ ga_ nai iteration. T he decrypted code resolves the necessary API functions, decompresses the embedded PE file with RtlCompressBuffer() using LZNT 1 and maps it into memory.What does the resulting watering hole What does the resulting watering hole look like? look like?T he websites were compromised to redirect visitors to instances of both ScanBox and BEeF.

T he T T Ps for this campaign are quite common for Chinese-speaking actors, where they typically provide new solid wrappers (launcher and decompressor protected with shikata_ ga_ nai in this case) around their RAT s (HyperBro).T he most unusual and interesting point here is the target. A national data center is a valuable source of data that can also be abused to compromise official websites. Another interesting point is the Mikrotik router, which we believe was hacked specifically for the campaign. T he reasons for this are not very clear: typically, Chinese-speaking actors don’t bother disguising their campaigns. Maybe these are the first steps in a new stealthier approach.Some indicators of compromise Some indicators of compromiseDr o ppe r s Dr o ppe r s22CBE2B0F1EF3F2B18B4C5AED6D7 BB7 9 0D032087 8946A7 37 49111E6C94BF1525Launche r Launche r ac337 bd5f6f18b8fe009e45d65a2b09bHype r Br o in-m e m o r y T r o jan Hype r Br o in-m e m o r y T r o jan 04dece2662f648f619d9c037 7 a7 ba7 c0Do m ains and IPs Do m ains and IPs bbs.sonypsps[.]com update.iaacstudio[.]com wh0am1.itbaydns[.]com google-updata[.]tk windows-updata[.]tkConvert webpages or entire websites to PDF - PDFmyURL!JAVASCRIPT T ARGET ED AT T ACKS T ROJAN VULNERABILIT IES AND EXPLOIT SShare post on:WAT ERING HOLE AT T ACKSRelated Posts Related Posts  VPNFilter EXIF to C2 mechanism analysedIT threat evolution Q1 2018.
