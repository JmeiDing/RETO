Drilling Deep A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryFeike Hacquebord and Cedric PernetContents5 The Infrastructure of a Typical Oil and Gas Company7 Threats23 Case Study: APT3329 Security Recommendations for the Oil and Gas IndustryPublished by Trend Micro ResearchWritten by Feike Hacquebord and Cedric PernetStock image used under license from Shutterstock.comFor Raimund Genes (1963-2017)The oil and gas industry is faced with a multitude of concerns and risks that may have significant impact on oil and gas production. Extreme weather can have a substantial negative influence on oil production and transportation, leading to high operating costs. Both global and local politics have an effect on the pricing of oil per barrel, thus affecting the profitability of oil companies. Physical attacks are also a problem; just recently a drone attack on the world’s largest refinery crippled 5% of the world’s global oil supply.1All of these different risks have to be mitigated, and at first glance, cyberattacks may seem less urgent to oil and gas companies. However, because of increased automation, the growing connectivity of computer networks, and the increased usage of cloud computing services, companies are more and more exposed to cybersecurity- related risks. To create a comprehensive security system and protect their assets on all fronts, oil and gas companies should be more aware of current cyberthreats and what they can do to defend themselves against these threats.In this paper, we give an overview of known digital attacks against the oil and gas industry and its supply chain. Current data shows that persistent actors, using relatively simple methods, can cause real harm to companies involved in this industry and even bring about circumstances that can affect world economies.Large-scale cyber intrusions on oil and gas companies are not theoretical scenarios; real-world strikeshave been causing damage for years. In August 2012, one of the biggest oil companies in the worldsuffered from an expansive cyberattack. Tens of thousands of the company’s computer servers wererendered unusable by the crippling wiper malware called Shamoon.2 Although the supply of crude oil tothe world was not affected at the time, the Shamoon attack proved to be a real risk to world economies.This watershed event was caused by destructive, yet relatively simple, malware.Cyberthreats to oil companies seem to become more prevalent and urgent when political tensions rise. Oilcompanies are targets of cyberattacks that are rooted in political agendas and geopolitical concerns. Forexample, recent incidents of unrest in the Gulf Region have cascaded into cyberspace, i.e. the internet.3There has been increased interest in malware attacks that target not only the military and defense industrybut also the oil and gas industry. This activity has been going on for almost a decade already.Additional destructive attacks on the oil industry continued between 2012 and 2019 with variations of theShamoon malware and a destructive wiper variant of the so-called StoneDrill malware. In 2018, it wasreported that an Italian oil company suffered from a Shamoon wiper attack.4 This time, a few hundredcomputer servers were hit. Around the same time, a British oil company reported it had suffered from asecurity breach caused by a variant of known malware.5There are several advanced actor groups or advanced persistent threats (APTs) that target the oil and gasindustry. In this paper, we describe some of the attack methods of an actor group that is commonly referredto as APT33 (also identified as Refined Kitten, Magnallium, and Elfin). APT33 is known to aggressivelytarget the oil and gas and aviation industries and their supply chains.In the fall of 2018, we observed that a U.K.-based oil company had computer servers both in the U.K. andIndia communicating with an APT33 command-and-control (C&C) server. Another European oil companyalso suffered from an APT33-related malware infection on one of its servers in India for at least threeweeks in November and December 2018. We also found that for at least two years, APT33 used theprivate website of a member of the national defense committee in the senate of a European country tosend spear-phishing emails to companies in the supply chain of oil products. Targets also included awater facility that supplied potable water to a U.S. military base.In this paper, we also include our findings on the multiple layers of obfuscation that APT33 puts up to runC&C servers they use in extremely targeted malware campaigns against targets in the Middle East andthe U.S.Pawn Storm6 is another threat actor group that has targeted the oil and gas industry. In particular, wehave seen reconnaissance attacks on email and VPN servers of oil and gas companies originating fromthis group.4 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryThe Infrastructure of a Typical Oil and Gas CompanyMost of the best understood attacks against the oil industry are initial attempts to break into the corporatenetworks of oil companies. We will discuss several of these attacks in this paper. At the outset, it isimportant to understand the complete oil and gas production chain and what risks are involved in thoseareas. This section will discuss these concerns in detail.The production chain, from exploring oil to producing end products like gasoline for cars, is oftentimesdivided into three parts: upstream, midstream, and downstream. Processes that are related to oilexploration and production are generally referred to as upstream. Transportation and storage of crude oilthrough pipelines, trains, ships, or trucks are referred to as midstream. And downstream is the productionof end products. Cyber risks are present in all three categories, but for midstream and upstream, there arefew publicly documented incidents.A typical oil company has production sites where crude oil is extracted from wells, tank farms where theoil is stored temporarily, and a transportation system to bring the crude oil to a refinery. Transportationmay include pipelines, trains, and ships. After processing in the refinery, different end products like dieselfuel, gasoline, and jet fuel are transported to tank farms and the products are later shipped to customers.A typical gas company also has production sites and a transportation system like pipelines, railroads, andships. But it also needs compressor stations where the natural gas is compressed to a specific pressureto be ready for transport. The natural gas is transported to a separation plant that separates differenthydrocarbon components from natural gas, like LPG and cooking gas. The different gasses are latertransported to customers using pipelines, trains, and ships.5 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryIn the whole chain — from oil and gas production to refineries to the several hydrocarbon end products —constant monitoring is crucial for performance measurement, performance improvement, quality control,and safety. Monitoring metrics include temperature, pressure, chemical composition, and detection ofleaks. Some oil and gas production sites are in very remote locations where the weather can be extreme. Inparticular for these sites, communication of the monitored metrics over the air, fixed (optic or copper) lines,or satellite is important. Likewise, remote control of on-site equipment such as valves, pumps, hydraulicand pneumatic control systems, safety instrumented systems (SISs), emergency stop systems, and firedetection equipment are crucial. All of the systems are controlled by software and can be compromisedby an attacker.Availability of these systems is key and there is usually no incentive for confidentiality. The communicationof both control messages and the monitoring data is oftentimes not encrypted and not even signedfor data integrity. This means that there are multiple theoretical attacks possible: sending attackercommands to control systems, injecting commands, changing sensor data, and replay attacks, amongothers. Fortunately, attackers are not likely to use these methods because the impact is limited by built-inmechanical safety measures that prevent hazardous situations. Also, many of these attacks would requirethe actor to be close to the oil well or refinery. There are only a few public reports on compromises ofindustrial control systems (ICSs) in the oil and gas industry, and some that describe attacks against SISs inrefineries.7, 8The more urgent threats oil and gas companies are facing come from several advanced attacker groupswho are focused on this industry. Among these groups are the same actors who usually attack the militaryand defense industry. These attackers have geopolitical impact and espionage in mind, and in somecases are aiming to deploy destructive attacks.Theft of intellectual property and industrial espionage are dangerous threats to oil companies too. Amongvaluable intellectual property typically held by these companies are the location of new proven oil reservesthat are not in production yet, techniques of effective drilling, and the chemical composition of additivesin premium car gasoline.In the succeeding sections, we will discuss the internet-related threats that are relevant to the oil and gasindustry. We will also give recommendations for defending oil and gas companies against each threat.6 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryThreatsThe biggest threats the oil and gas industry have to worry about are those that have a direct negativeimpact on the production of their end products. Aside from these, espionage is something the industry hasto defend itself against as well. Actors may steal intellectual property through these compromises, andespionage can also be the starting point of destructive attacks or sabotage that may impact companies’product supply.Infrastructure SabotageAn important threat the oil and gas industry is facing is infrastructure sabotage. The initial action tosabotage infrastructure is the same as that for a usual advanced targeted attack: reconnaissance. Theattacker first needs to collect information about the target and then use this information to compromisesystems or computer servers on the targeted network. The attacker does not need to maintain accessto the system. The attacker may also try to remove all evidence of compromise while proceeding withthe sabotage.Sabotage in this context can be done via different actions:• Altering the behavior of software• Deleting or wiping off specific content to disrupt the activity of the company• Deleting or wiping off as much content as possible on every accessible machineSome examples of these kinds of sabotage operations have been reported broadly, the most famousbeing the Stuxnet case.9 Stuxnet was a piece of self-replicating malware that contained a very targetedand specific payload. Most infections of the worm were located in Iran and analysis revealed that it wasdesigned to exclusively target the centrifuge in the uranium enrichment facility of the Natanz Nuclear Plantin the country. The malware targeted Siemens’ WinCC/PCS 7 SCADA control software specifically, andonly when it fit certain precise parameters in their configuration. It destroyed several nuclear enrichmentcentrifuges, which lowered the productivity of the nuclear plant. Despite the fact that Stuxnet was developedwith one particular goal in mind, it did spread further within the oil industry (even without launching itsdedicated payload).107 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryAnother example is the malware Industroyer (aka Crashoverride).11 This malware contains specificpayloads for ICSs used in electric substations, although it can be refitted to target other types of criticalinfrastructure. In addition to these payloads, it contains a data wiper part that can be triggered to erasedata and make systems unbootable.The BlackEnergy malware is also of note. This malware evolved through time, from being a trojan to beinga new piece of malware delivering a payload known as KillDisk. It targeted the power facility PrykarpattyaOblenergo and other electricity distribution companies in Ukraine. Research by Trend Micro also revealedthat it targeted a large Ukrainian mining company and a large Ukrainian railway operator,12 showing thatsuch modular malware could be used against different industries.There is also the Triton malware, which was built to interact with Triconex SIS controllers and could,among other features, shut them down.13The Shamoon (aka Disttrack) campaigns, which had at least three known waves of attack from 2012 to2018,14 on oil and gas companies have been incredibly aggressive. The biggest target of these attacks,a Saudi oil company, had about 30,000 computers rendered unbootable by the destructive malware.The impact was significant since a lot of the oil company’s computer servers were disrupted for weeks.However, the world oil supply was essentially not affected by these attacks.While these examples show strong developer skills in terms of building specific malware, special malwareis not always needed for attacks to be successful. Any remote access tool that could allow an attacker togain access to a human-machine interface (HMI) for equipment would work. Also, there are cases whenno outside attack is needed, as when the threat comes from within the company. The next section dealswith that danger: the insider threat.Insider ThreatAn insider — in most cases, a disgruntled employee seeking revenge or merely wanting to make easymoney selling valuable data to competitors — can commit sabotage operations. Although there areseveral factors that can motivate a person to turn against their employer, revenge is the more dangeroustype since the individual could not care less which part of the company is targeted. Blackmail can alsobe a motivation for an inside job.An insider may do the following:• Altering data to create problems, misuse access, or cause damage• Deleting or destroying data from corporate servers, shared project folders, or any location the insiderhas access to• Stealing intellectual property for the insider’s own use or for a competitor’s• Leaking sensitive corporate documents to third parties or competitors, or even uploading them to theinternet8 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryDefense against insider threats is very complex, since insiders generally have access to a lot of data. Inaddition, unlike an external attacker, an insider does not need months to know the internal network of thecompany — the insider probably already has knowledge of the inner workings of the organization. Withthat knowledge, the insider probably knows how to inflict damage to the company’s business more thanany external attacker.Careful monitoring of user activity can bring this kind of activity to light, but the task is still very difficult. Itmight be difficult to distinguish the usual daily operations from sabotage actions — for example, simpleactions like modifying a document or deleting a file could be part of a sabotage attempt.Espionage and Data TheftWhile sabotage of the daily operations is among the most damaging attacks on the oil and gas industry,data theft and espionage are important threats the industry needs to be aware of as well. As mentionedabove, data theft and espionage can be the starting point of a larger destructive attack. Attackers oftenneed specific information before attempting further action. Obtaining sensitive data like well drillingtechniques, data on suspected oil and gas reserves, and special recipes for premium products can alsotranslate to monetary gain for attackers.In the next sections, we will discuss some of the advanced espionage and theft techniques and securityconcerns that affect the oil and gas industry.DNS HijackingDNS hijacking is a particularly dangerous attack used by a limited set of advanced attackers. The aimof DNS hijacking may include getting access to the corporate VPN network or corporate emails ofgovernments and companies. This is particularly relevant for the oil industry, as we have seen a number ofoil companies being targeted by advanced attackers who probably have certain geopolitical goals in mind.In DNS hijacking, the DNS settings of a domain name are modified by an unauthorized third party. Thethird party can, for instance, add an additional entry to the zone file of a domain or alter the resolution ofone or more of the existing hostnames. The simplest things the attacker can do are committing vandalism(defacement), leaving a message on the hijacked website, and making the website unavailable. This willusually be noticed quickly and the result may just be reputational damage. However, there are moredangerous attacks possible, with a much bigger impact: theft of corporate credentials, interception ofemails, VPN access to the corporate network, and launching a watering hole attack. Ultimately, thesemay even lead to lasting access to the victim’s network by an unauthorized third party. An actor can, forexample, use the (short) time window of the DNS hijack to send internal malware-ridden emails usingcredentials intercepted during the hijack.9 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryDNS hijacking attacks can happen by targeting registrants of a domain name. But many registrars andDNS providers have two-factor authentication in place for their customers. Two-factor authenticationraises the bar significantly for a successful attack. More dangerous actors may use different tactics thatthe domain owner cannot easily repel.One possible scheme involves an actor not attacking the registrant of a domain directly, but instead theregistrar of the domain or even registries. More specifically, the actor can try to compromise the registrar’scredentials for the management system that is used to push changes on domains to registries and DNSroot servers. Once the registrar is compromised, the actor can push specific changes for the domainsthat are under control of the registrar. For example, the actor can change the legitimate authoritativenameservers to other nameservers under the actor’s control. Once that has succeeded, the actor canpoint domains to a foreign IP he controls.We have seen these attacks targeting mail servers of government agencies in particular, and thereare serious possible compromise scenarios. When the attacker is also able to create a valid, new SSLcertificate of the hijacked domain, the attacker can even intercept SSL connections to the corporateservers and potentially intercept corporate credentials that are sent to a hijacked version of the IMAPserver. To create an SSL certificate of a domain the attacker doesn’t own, the attacker usually has to showownership of the domain. When the attacker is able to intercept emails to the domain owner, the attackermay be able to fool a certificate authority and pose as the legitimate owner of a domain. With that, a validSSL certificate may be issued.There are ways to raise the bar for DNS hijack attacks. First of all, the use of multi-factor authentication willmake attacks more difficult, though not impossible. As explained in a talk by Bill Woodcock, the executivedirector of Packet Clearing House,15 using Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) validationfor all email clients also helps. In the event that the IMAP server domain gets hijacked, the email clientswon’t make a connection to the foreign IP address as the DNSSEC validation fails. In his talk, Woodcocksays the use of mobile device management (MDM) is advised as well, to force mobile users who are notin the office to use the right recursive DNS servers that implement DNSSEC validation.While most DNS hijacking attacks16 have happened against government organizations, some oil companieshave been affected too. Most likely, these oil companies fell victim to politically motivated attacks such asthe incidents that happened in 2018 and 2019 in the Middle East. These attacks might have resulted ininterception of emails, interception of corporate credentials, temporary access to the corporate VPN, andeven semi-persistent access to the corporate network.The risk of DNS hijacking can be further reduced by a couple of additional measures. First, a script cancheck the DNS records of the critical domains and hostnames of an organization frequently — everyminute or as often as may be desired. By walking down the whole DNS hierarchy for crucial domain10 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas Industrynames starting from the root servers, the script can quickly notice any unauthorized changes in the chain.If this monitoring is done frequently enough, the potential damage can be limited significantly.Once an organization has become a victim of a DNS hijack attack and the DNS settings have been restored tonormal, it is important to note that crucial information might have been stolen, such as corporate credentials.Obviously, passwords should be reset. Also if, for example, the webmail or mail domain was hijacked, thatmight have just been a way for the attacker to get into systems and get persistent access to the network withmalware or gain unauthorized VPN access. In that case, a full security sweep of the corporate network willbe necessary.DNS hijack attacks can also be used to plant an exploit on a hijacked website with an audience theattacker is interested in. For example, we saw that during an attack in 2019 the personal blog of a prolificmember of an American think tank was hijacked. While we were unable to reproduce what happenedexactly on the hijacked domain, an obvious case scenario would be a watering hole attack. This wateringhole could then infect the readers of the blog during the DNS hijack.Attacks on Webmail and Corporate VPN ServersFigure 1. An example of a phishing site of APT33Webmail is a very useful tool for individuals who want to have access to their emails while on the road.The same holds for file-sharing services from third-party service providers with which employees canwork together on a project. However, these services increase the attack surface. For example, a webmailhostname might get DNS-hijacked or hacked because of a vulnerability in the webmail software. Webmailand file-sharing and collaboration platforms can be compromised in credential-phishing attacks. A well-prepared credential-phishing attack can be quite convincing, as when an actor registers a domain namethat resembles the legitimate webmail hostname, or when an actor creates a valid SSL certificate and11 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas Industrychooses the targets within an organization carefully. The risk of webmail and third-party file-sharingservices can be greatly reduced by requiring two-factor authentication (preferably with a physical key)and corporate VPN access to these services.However, VPN credentials and one-time passwords can be phished as well. There have also been criticalvulnerabilities in VPN software and some webmail software that could give third parties unauthorizedaccess. It is very important to patch these vulnerabilities as soon as security updates are ready to beinstalled. We have seen that advanced attackers scan VPN servers and webmail servers, hunting forexploitable vulnerabilities. In September 2019, an APT actor scanned servers running specific VPNsoftware, including those in a state-owned oil company. And in October 2019, Pawn Storm (aka APT28or Sofacy) scanned the mail servers of several oil companies in the U.K.Data LeaksData leaks have always been problematic for companies across industries. The oil and gas industry, inparticular, is very competitive and almost any kind of leaked information can be beneficial to a competitor.Data leaks can also cause substantial damage to a company’s reputation. It has been said for decadesthat data should be carefully handled inside companies, yet this is not enough. Outside monitoring shouldbe put in place as well.What happens when data that is carefully handled internally is sent to an outside partner? What happenswhen a company uses unfamiliar tools and software? What happens when a company does not know thatthe software shares files on remote servers? And what happens when those files are stored on unsecureexternal networks, in some cases becoming freely accessible even to anyone who knows the data isthere? Needless to say, these are serious issues that should be considered by all companies.In the course of our research, we easily found dozens of sensitive documents related to the oil industryonline. One way of finding these documents is by using specially crafted Google queries, called GoogleDorks. We will not show any of these search engine queries in this research paper since the matter is verysensitive and we do not want to help cybercriminals. Some redacted examples of data we could retrieveare below.Another way to find such content is to hunt for data on public services like Pastebin, an online service thatallows anyone to copy and paste any text-based content and store it there, privately or publicly. Anothersource of data is public sandboxes meant for analysis of suspicious files. Users can mistakenly sendlegitimate documents to these sandboxes for analysis. Once uploaded, these documents can be parsedor downloaded by third parties.12 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryThese are several common security lapses that companies should correct in regard to document storage:• Documents are stored on a web server in a folder that is world-readable.• Documents are stored on a file server without proper access control.• Documents are backed up on an unsecure server accessible to anyone.While it is not a problem to see official documents that were meant for publication online in differentlocations, it becomes problematic when the documents are internal only or require a security clearance.Those document leaks can affect the “victim” company in several ways:• Affects one or several company employees• Affects the company’s public image• Leaks nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) or contracts signed between a company and a third party• Leaks information that can be leveraged by competitors• Leaks information that can be used legally against the company• Leaks information that can harm long-term projects or road mapsThis is particularly significant in the energy industry, where most information is usually kept internal.Figure 2. A sampling report sent from a private laboratory to an oil companyAn example is a full document we recently found sent from a laboratory to an oil company, providing theexact location, ship name, and results for particular oil particles (SN100, SN150) hunting. Information ona potential contamination is confidential and sensitive for any company in the oil and gas industry andshould not be publicly available.13 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryExternal EmailsWhile emails are generally well protected inside companies, external emails cannot be controlled thesame way. Employees regularly send emails to external addresses, hence some sensitive internal contentending up outside the company’s purview. Even worse, sensitive information can be copied to unsecurebackup systems or stored locally on personal computers without standard corporate security protocols,which makes it easier for attackers to get hold of the information. Once a computer is compromised, anattacker can get the emails and use them in different ways to harm a company. For example, an actorcould leak them on public servers or services like Pastebin.Figure 3. Sample content from an email found in the wild, sent from an oil company employeeto a third-party service providerEven to someone not knowledgeable about the industry, it becomes clear that interesting information isfound when an email starts by mentioning a level of confidentiality.Figure 4. Sample content from an email found in the wild indicating a “confidential” level of informationDefending Organizations Against Data LeaksA company can identify leaked documents only if it has solid knowledge of all internal documents. Therefore,any important document inside the company should be watermarked in a way that makes it discoverableon the internet, since constantly monitoring for specific marks makes finding leaked documents easier.Google Dorks based on documents’ characteristics and contents — it can be as simple as searching forspecific names associated with the word “confidential,” for example — and searches on online serviceslike Pastebin17 should be done daily. The frequency is necessary since companies should be as reactiveas possible when a document appears in public or somewhere where it should not be.Data leaks will happen at some point, whether by “bad handling or mistakes” or by malicious exposure.The important thing is to find them before someone with bad intentions does, and have them removedquickly.14 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryOne of the first steps in mitigating the risk of data leaks is to make a list of keywords that are critical toa company. Specific watermarks of sensitive documents should also be collected. Automated searchqueries for these keywords and watermarks on the internet can then be set up with a script. Even better,a company can outsource all monitoring and data leak prevention to an external service provider thatspecializes in preventing and mitigating data leaks.RansomwareIn the past, cybercriminals were spreading ransomware wherever they could, mostly using spam botnetsto try to infect as many machines as possible. While it remains a serious threat to any individual whostores data on their computer, ransomware has become an even larger threat as ransomware actors havebeen targeting companies specifically, with attacks that may have a big impact on daily operations.Targeting individuals is fairly easy for cybercriminals, even for those with a low level of computerknowledge. The easiest business model consists of subscribing to ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) offerson underground cybercrime marketplaces.18 Any fraudster can buy such a service and start deliveringransomware to thousands of individuals’ computers by using exploit kits or spam emails.Targeting companies and organizations takes more effort. Infecting a company with ransomware thesame way it is done with individuals is inefficient because the goal is not about infecting a few computers.Typically, an actor will try to disrupt a whole company. To this end, the attacker needs to spend time“profiling” its target entity, collecting information about it, much in the same way as the attacker would doin a targeted attack.That reconnaissance phase is necessary for the attacker to get to the next stage: compromising one orseveral of the target computers, generally via specially tailored spear-phishing emails or by exploitingan unsecure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection. Once inside a network, the attacker will tryto move laterally and then carefully choose a moment to drop ransomware either on selected serversor massively across the network. The end goal is to render the company unable to operate its normalbusiness or unable to recover its lost data (for example, by tampering with the backup system), so that itis more likely to pay the ransom.We found that a U.S. oil and natural gas company was hit by ransomware, infecting three computers andits cloud backups. The computers that were targeted contained essential data for the company, and theestimated total loss was more than US$30 million. While we do not have additional details on this case,we believe the attackers did plan this attack carefully and were able to target a few strategic computersrather than hitting the company with a massive infection.15 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryMore recently, we discovered a variant of the ransomware family BitPaymer19 that had targeted a U.S.company specializing in providing services for oil well drilling. The actors behind BitPaymer typicallyuse spear phishing to infect their targets with initial malware, before spending time moving laterally andcompromising the network further. They plant the ransomware in specific spots in the network and launchthe malware, for example, on a Saturday night. They are efficient and dangerous, and they know how totake advantage of the absence of IT people during weekends or holidays to infect selected machines andencrypt the contents.The ransom message of BitPaymer is the same for every target, except for the first line, where the companyname is written, and the email addresses for reaching the fraudsters.Hello XXX.Your network was hacked and encrypted.No free decryption software is available on the web.Email us at XXX@PROTONMAIL.COM (or) XXX@TUTANOTA.DE to get the ransom amount.Keep our contacts safe. Disclosure can lead to impossibility of decryption.Please, use your company name as the email subject.Figure 5. The ransom message from the latest variants of BitPaymer (company name andemail addresses of fraudsters removed)Ever-changing MalwareMalware is an important part of targeted threat actors’ arsenal. Different kinds of malware serve differentpurposes and have different ways of functioning and communicating between the infected computersand the C&C servers.Threat actors targeting oil and gas companies for cyberespionage definitely want to stay undetectedinside their target’s network. Compromising and planting malware inside a target network is just the initialstage for attackers. Yet for a number of reasons, these actions can be detected after a while or even justdeleted automatically by any antivirus or security solution.To avoid being kicked off from the network when the only available access is via their malware, attackersgenerally choose to regularly update their malware. And if possible, they use different malware families sothat they have more than one way to access the compromised network.Malware updates can be functionality or code updates, or sometimes just slight modifications for avoidingdetection.16 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryCybercriminals working with malware often use online testing platforms like VirusTotal to check whethertheir files are detected by different security products. Some threat actors run their own testing platformsfor better operational security reasons. They do not send their files to any third party and they want to besure the files are not known to security companies before a campaign starts to spread them in the wild.Trend Micro has successfully collaborated with law enforcement to take some of these platforms down(such as Scan4You20 and Refud.me21) and help catch the cybercriminals behind them.Once a file has a “close to zero” or even zero detection rate, it becomes “FUD” (fully undetectable) andit can be used in an attack. In order to alter the malware well enough to become undetectable, attackersoften use crypter software, which refers to programs that modify and obfuscate binaries to escapedetection. Attackers can also note the exact security products used by the target, and only considerbypassing that one and not care about others.In the next sections, we will discuss some of the most common malware types and tools that are usedagainst the oil and gas industry.WebshellsWebshells are tiny files, generally written in PHP, ASP, or JavaScript language, that have been fraudulentlyuploaded to a web server belonging to a targeted entity. An attacker just needs to browse to it to getaccess to the web server. Most common options for webshells provide upload or download file operations,command line (shell), and dump databases.Webshells can also be tiny files connecting back to a server that listen for communications.Figure 6. Webshell example: A shell window opened in the China Chopper webshell GUI17 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryThreat actors sometimes use webshells to ease their operations, generally at an early infection stage.They can use webshells to:• Download or upload files to the compromised web server.• Run other tools (such as credential stealers).• Maintain persistence on the compromised infrastructure.• Bounce to other servers and move on with more compromises.• Steal information.Threat actors that target the oil industry, like OilRig, have typically used webshells (TwoFace,DarkSeaGreenShell, possibly more) to serve most of these purposes.CookiesCookies are small files sent from web servers and stored in the browser of an internet user. They servedifferent legitimate purposes, such as allowing a browser to know if the user is logged in or not (as in thecase of authentication cookies) or storing stateful information (like items in shopping carts).Some variants of the backdoor BKDR64_RGDOOR22 used cookies23 to handle communications betweenthe malware and its C&C server. They used the string “RGSESSIONID=” followed by encrypted content.Careful cookie field monitoring in HTTP traffic can help detect this kind of activity.DNS TunnelingWhile the most common way for malware to communicate with its C&C server is by using the HTTPor HTTPS protocol (usually to evade firewall rules or filtering), some attackers allow their malware tocommunicate via DNS tunneling. The technique is not new and has its limitations, which is why it is notseen quite often in APT attacks. But some actors do like using it, such as OilRig and GreenBug.DNS tunneling in this context exploits the DNS protocol to transmit data between the malware and itscontroller, via DNS queries and response packets.The DNS client software (the malware) sends data, generally encoded in some ways, prepended as thehostname of the DNS query. As an example, the malware might want to send a username “prouser1” tothe controller. The malware encodes this username in Base64 format:prouser1 => cHJvdXNlcjEThe malware then sends the following DNS query:cHJvdXNlcjE.c2serverdomainname.com18 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryIn this fictional example, the domain c2serverdomainname.com is owned and controlled by the attacker,and points its nameserver (NS) records toward the server where DNS tunneling server software (thecontroller) is running.The server can then reply to the DNS query with different kinds of answers. Data can, for example, be sentto the malware in the answered query via the CNAME record, or in the TXT field, or others.Real examples from the wild have affected the oil and gas industry. The Alma communicator DNS tunnelingtrojan24 used by OilRig uses encryption to send data back and forth via DNS tunneling. The ISMDoormalware also uses similar techniques.25The limitation of the DNS tunneling technique resides in the length of data that can be transmitted perrequest. In the best case, via the TXT record, for example, only 255 bytes can be sent at a time. If theattacker needs to send more, the attacker needs to use several DNS queries.Careful examination of the DNS requests sent from an infrastructure can be very effective in detectingDNS tunneling.Email as a Communication ChannelIt is possible for an attacker to use email as a communication channel between the attacker’s malware andits controller. While it might sound very amateurish for senior computer security professionals becausethis method has typically been used by novice malware writers, it can still be seen in the wild.An APT attacker might want to use this method mostly for two reasons: email services, especially externalonline services, might be less monitored than other services in the compromised network, and it mightprovide an additional level of anonymity depending on the email service provider that is used.In a typical scenario, the malware logs on the email service and reads emails from the inbox, whichcontain instructions from the malware controller. It can also use the service to send data back.One example of this modus operandi from a threat actor targeting the oil and gas industry is Kimsuky.This threat actor actively used this method with the malware BKDR_KIMSUK.A,26 which used a free emailservice to communicate.It is difficult to detect such behavior on the network, since legitimate users are generally allowed to usefree email services and traffic is often SSL-encrypted.19 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryZero-day ExploitsIt is still a popular thought that all advanced targeted attacks use zero-day exploits and sophisticatedcode to infect corporate computers and gain full access to the network infrastructure of a company.But this is not what usually happens in the real world of targeted attacks. Oftentimes, attackers limitthemselves to the use of known exploits, and they use zero-day exploits only when really necessary.It actually does not take much effort to compromise most networks, gain access, and exfiltrate informationwith standard malware and tools. Of course, some threat actors have more weapons than others, andthose weapons may include zero-day exploits.The Stuxnet case has been an interesting one in this respect, with the use of four different zero-day exploits.No other known attack has been seen exploiting so many unpatched and unknown vulnerabilities — ithas shown an extraordinary level of sophistication.Two years before Stuxnet, another malware from the Equation group27 was using two of the four zero-dayexploits that Stuxnet used. The Equation group targeted many different sectors, including oil and gas,energy, and nuclear research. It showed advanced technical capabilities, including infecting the harddrive firmware of several major hard drive manufacturers, which had seemed impossible without thefirmware source code.Other cases affecting the oil and gas industry have been reported by the media. The Reaper threatactor, for example, used a zero-day exploit abusing Adobe Flash, and also sometimes exploited recentlypatched vulnerabilities. Also, just recently, an actor group was actively scanning for vulnerable VPNservers, including VPN servers of oil companies.Mobile Phone MalwareThe use of mobile phone malware has increased slowly in recent years. While it is mostly used forcybercrime, it can also be used for espionage.The Reaper threat actor has developed Android malware,28 which we detect as AndroidOS_KevDroid.This malware has several functionalities, including starting video or audio recording, downloading theaddress book from the compromised phone, fetching specific files, and reading SMS messages and otherinformation from the phone.The MuddyWater APT group29 has used several variants of Android malware (AndroidOS_Mudwater.HRX,AndroidOS_HiddenApp.SAB, AndroidOS_Androrat.AXM and .AXMA) posing as legitimate applications.These malware variants have the capability to completely take control of an Android phone, spreadinfecting links via SMS, and steal contacts, SMS messages, screenshots, and call logs.20 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryFigure 7. A list of commands supported by the Android malware AndroidOS_Mudwater.HRXIn most cases, mobile phone malware poses as known legitimate software as a lure to infect unsuspectingusers. For example, users may think they are downloading the latest version of Signal or Telegram whilethey are in fact being infected by malware.BluetoothBluetooth can also be exploited by threat actors. And one of the most interesting recent discoveries in thisregard is the USB Bluetooth Harvester.30 It is very uncommon, but it highlights the need for organizationsto stay up to date on threat actor developments.Reaper has deployed malware (TrojanSpy.Win32.BLUEHARV.A) that steals Bluetooth devices’ information.When it is run, it collects basic information on connected Bluetooth devices, such as the device names,addresses, classes, and a few additional status flags.Cloud Services There are many ways for attackers to try to render the traffic between their malware and the C&C serverundetectable. One of these is to use legitimate cloud services to handle the communications betweenthe malware and the controller. The Slub malware,31 for example, has been used for APT attacks. Whileit has not affected the oil and gas industry yet, it bears mentioning here as its use of GitHub, a softwaredevelopment platform, and Slack, a collaborative messaging service, for C&C communication can easilybe copied by other threat actors.21 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryMore interestingly, MuddyWater has used Telegram, a messaging service with end-to-end encryption, toexfiltrate data from one of its Android malware variants.32 Another of MuddyWater’s malware variants hasused the API for the online storage service Dropbox. The malware stores all commands from the controllerand their results in the cloud.33C&C connections to cloud services are difficult to detect since they are using normal services that anyemployee can use for legitimate purposes. One way to prevent attacks that take advantage of cloudservices is to blacklist all of these services. However, this is likely to reduce the company’s efficiency andgenerate discomfort for employees.22 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryCase Study: APT33In this section, we will focus on some aspects of an actor group called APT33. APT33 is generallyconsidered to be responsible for many spear-phishing campaigns targeting the oil industry and its supplychain. A lot has been published about APT33 already, but we will highlight some facts that were notpublished before the release of our earlier blog post.34 In particular, we will describe what measuresAPT33 takes to obscure a dozen live C&C servers that have been used in extreme narrow targeting sinceabout 2016. We will also list IP addresses that have been used by APT33 to do reconnaissance andbotnet management since 2018.APT33 is known to target not only the oil supply chain but also the aviation industry and military anddefense companies. We have observed that the group has had some limited success in infecting targetsrelated to oil, the U.S. military, and U.S. national security. For example, we found that in 2019 APT33 wasable to infect a U.S. company providing supporting services to national security.APT33 has also compromised oil companies in Europe and Asia. A large oil company with a presence inthe U.K. and India had concrete APT33-related infections in the fall of 2018. Some of the IP addresses ofthe oil company communicated with the C&C server times-sync.com, which hosted a so-called PowertonC&C server from October to December 2018, and then again in 2019. A computer server in India ownedby a European oil company communicated with a Powerton C&C server used by APT33 for at least threeweeks in November and December 2019. We also observed that a large U.K.-based company offeringspecialized services to oil refineries and petrochemical installations was likely compromised by APT33 inthe fall of 2018.APT33 has attacked the supply chain of the oil industry broadly. For about two years, multiple spear-phishing campaigns of APT33 were sent from a compromised private website of a politician who hada seat in the defense committee of the senate in a European country. The targets of these campaignsincluded companies that operated oil tankers, IT companies that specialized in the oil industry, a publisherof an online magazine that covered news on oil, and several manufacturers of valves and other industrialequipment. APT33 has also been targeting a water facility that supplies potable water to a U.S. militarybase for several years. But recent attack waves of APT33 indicate that the actor group has been targetingcompanies more narrowly.23 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryAPT33’s best-known infection technique has been using social engineering through emails. It has beenusing the same type of lure for several years: a spear-phishing email containing a job opening offer thatmay look quite legitimate. There have been campaigns involving job openings in the oil and aviationindustries.DateFrom AddressSubjectDec. 31, 2016recruitment@alsalam.aeroJob OpportunityApril 17, 2017recruitment@alsalam.aeroVacancy AnnouncementJuly 17, 2017careers@ngaaksa.comJob OpenningSept. 11, 2017jobs@ngaaksa.gaJob OpportunityNov. 20, 2017jobs@dyn-intl.gaNov. 28, 2017jobs@dyn-intl.gaJob OpenningJob OpenningMarch 5, 2018jobs@mail.dyn-corp.gaJob OpenningJuly 2, 2018careers@sipchem.gaJob Opportunity SIPCHEMJuly 30, 2018jobs@sipchem.gaAug. 14, 2018jobs@sipchem.gaJob OpenningJob OpenningAug. 26, 2018careers@aramcojobs.gaLatest VacancyAug. 28, 2018careers@aramcojobs.gaLatest VacancySept. 25, 2018careers@aramcojobs.gaAramCo JobsOct. 22, 2018jobs@samref.gaJob Openning at SAMREFTable 1. Known job offering campaigns of APT33The emails contain a link to a malicious .hta file. This .hta file will attempt to download a PowerShellscript, which may download additional malware from APT33 so that the group can gain persistence inthe network of the target. Some of the malware is quite generic in nature, while the others seem to beused by APT33 alone. Table 1 lists some of the campaigns we were able to recover from data based onfeedback from the Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ infrastructure. The company names in thecampaigns are not necessarily targets in the campaign, but they are usually part of the social lure usedin the campaigns.24 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryFigure 8. PHP mailer script probably used by APT33. The script was hosted on the personal websiteof a European senator who had a seat on his nation’s defense committee.The job opening social engineering lures are used for a reason: Some of the targets actually get legitimateemail notifications about job openings for the same companies used in the spear-phishing emails. Thismeans that APT33 has some knowledge of what their targets are receiving from legitimate sources.APT33 is known to be related to the destructive malware called StoneDrill and is possibly related toattacks involving Shamoon, although we don’t have solid evidence for the latter.Besides the relatively aggressive attacks of APT33 on the supply chain, we found that APT33 has beenusing several C&C domains, listed in Table 2, for small botnets composed of about a dozen bots each. Itappears that APT33 has taken special care to make tracking more difficult.The C&C domains are hosted on cloud-hosted proxies. These proxies relay URL requests from theinfected bots to back-ends at shared web servers that may host thousands of legitimate domains. Theseback-ends are protected with special software that detects unusual probing from researchers. The back-ends report bot data back to a dedicated aggregator and bot control server that is on a dedicated IPaddress. The APT33 actors connect to these aggregators via a private VPN with exit nodes that arechanged frequently. Using these VPN connections, the APT33 actors issue commands and retrieve datafrom the bots. In the fall of 2019, we counted 10 live bot data-aggregating or bot-controlling servers, andwe tracked a couple of these servers for months. These aggregators get data from typically very few C&Cservers (around one or two). For every unique C&C domain, there are usually only a dozen or fewer victims.25 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryDomainDate createdoorgans.comsuncocity.comMay 28, 2016May 31, 2016zandelshop.comJune 1, 2016simsoshop.comJune 2, 2016zeverco.comqualitweb.comJune 5, 2016June 6, 2016service-explorer.comMarch 3, 2017service-norton.comMarch 6, 2017service-eset.comMarch 6, 2017service-essential.com March 7, 2017Table 2.

APT33’s usage of a private VPNFor any company in the oil and gas industry, it might be a good idea to cross-relate these IP addresseswith log files.28 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustrySecurity Recommendations for the Oil and Gas IndustryIn this section, we give general advice that can help companies in the oil and gas industry combatthreat actors.Perform data integrity checks.While there may not be an immediate need for encrypting all data communications in an oil and gascompany, there is some merit in taking steps to ensure data integrity. For example, with regard to theinformation from the different sensors at oil production sites, the risk of tampering with oil production canbe reduced by at least making sure that all data communication is signed. This can greatly decrease therisk of man-in-the-middle attacks where sensor values could be changed or where a third party couldalter commands or inject commands without authorization.Implement DNSSEC.We have noticed that many oil and gas companies don’t have Domain Name System Security Extensions(DNSSEC) implemented. DNSSEC means digitally signing the DNS records of a domain name at theauthoritative nameserver with a private key. DNS resolvers can check whether DNS records are properlysigned. This checking can be done both on the corporate recursive DNS resolvers and at the clients. It ispreferred to do DNSSEC validation at the clients as this ensures that DNSSEC checks are also done whenemployees use their corporate computing device while traveling or while working from home. DNSSEChelps to combat DNS spoofing and hijacking. As explained earlier in this paper, DNSSEC validation forall email clients in an organization can help raise the bar of an attack in case mail-related domains of theorganization are DNS-hijacked.Lock down domain names.Domain names can potentially be taken over by a malicious actor, for example, through an unauthorizedchange in the DNS settings. To prevent this, it is important to use only a DNS service provider thatrequires two-factor authentication for any changes in the DNS settings of the domains of an organization.29 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryMonitor SSL certificates.For the protection of a brand name and for early warnings of possible upcoming attacks, it is importantto monitor newly created SSL certificates that have certain keywords in the Common Name field. Forexample, a company can monitor for SSL certificates that have one of its brand names in the CommonName field. These SSL certificates could be used in credential-phishing attacks or malware attacks wherethe C&C server domain would not ring a bell immediately in log files.Look out for business email compromise.Protection against business email compromise (BEC) is possible through spam filtering, user trainingfor spotting suspicious emails, and AI techniques that will recognize writing styles of individuals in thecompany. Most individuals have a particular style of writing, and a writing DNA profile can be defined froma set of emails written by a specific person. Using the profiles of individuals in the company, an AI algorithmcan potentially recognize BEC emails that attempt to mimic users (usually high-profile executives) withina company.Require at least two-factor authentication for webmail.A webmail hostname might get DNS-hijacked or hacked because of a vulnerability in the webmail software.And webmail can also be attacked with credential-phishing attacks; a well-prepared credential-phishingattack can be quite convincing. The risk of using webmail can be greatly reduced by requiring two-factorauthentication (preferably with a physical key) and corporate VPNs for webmail access.Hold employee training sessions for security awareness.It is important to have regular training sessions for all employees. These sessions may include awarenesstraining on credential phishing, spear phishing, social media use, data management, privacy policies,protecting intellectual property, and physical security.35Monitor for data leaks.Any important document should be watermarked in a way that makes it discoverable on the internet.Watermarks make it easier to find leaked documents since the company can constantly monitor forthese specific marks. There are also companies that specialize in finding leaked data and compromisedcredentials; through active monitoring for leaks, potential damage to the company can be mitigated earlier.30 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryKeep VPN software up to date.Several weaknesses in VPN software were found in recent years.36, 37 For various reasons, some companiesdo not update their VPN software immediately after patches become available. This is particularlydangerous since APT actors start to probe for vulnerable VPN servers (including those of oil companies)as soon as a vulnerability becomes public.Review the security settings of cloud services.For companies that use cloud services, a review of all security settings and proper risk assessmentare necessary. Cloud services can boost efficiency and reduce cost, but companies sometimes forgetto effectively use all security measures offered by the cloud services. There are also services that helpcompanies with cloud infrastructure security.3831 | Drilling Deep: A Look at Cyberattacks on the Oil and Gas IndustryReferences1 Stephen Kalin, Rania El Gamal, and Dmitry Zhdannikov.
