No parties in Libya before this analysis reported to use cyber attacks, malwares nor recruit hackers to spy on their rivals. Today we have a different story.In the past weeks on 6 August 2016, Cyberkov Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) received a numerous Android malwares operating in different areas in Libya especially in Tripoli and Benghazi.The malware spreads very fast using Telegram messenger application in smartphones, targeting high-profile Libyan influential and political figures.The malware first discovery was after a highly Libyan influential Telegram account compromised via web Telegram using IP address from Spain.The following day, the attackers spread an Android malware binded with legitimate Android application from the compromised Telegram account to all his contacts pretending it is an important voice message (misspelled it by “Voice Massege.apk”) which indicates a non-english (maybe an Arabic) attacker.After spreading the malware, more Android smartphones has been infected using the same technique (via Telegram) and then repost the malware again and again making a network of victims.Analysis of this incident led us to believe that this operation and the group behind it which we call Libyan Scorpions is a malware operation in use since September 2015 and operated by a politically motivated group whose main objective is intelligence gathering, spying on influentials and political figures and operate an espionage campaign within Libya.Also, the analysis of the incident led to the discovery of multiple malwares targeting Android and Windows machines.Libyan Scorpions threat actors used a set of methods to hide and operate their malwares. They appear not to have highly technical skills but a good social engineering and phishing tricks. The threat actors are not particularly sophisticated, but it is well-understood that such attacks don’t need to be sophisticated in order to be effective.Using malwares as weapon in an active warzone such as Libya, make the victims easy targets for assassination or kidnapping by tracking their physical locations and monitoring them day and night.Tel: +965 22445500 | Fax: +1 (888) 4333113 | Email: info@cyberkov.com | Website: www.cyberkov.com34Hunting Libyan ScorpionsTactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)Libyan Scorpions is believed to be a political motivated group targeting a high-level influential and political figures in multiple cities within Libya. Libyan Scorpions first compromised a personal Telegram account for a Libyan influential person with unknown vector. The victim received a push notification from his Telegram app that someone from Spain is logged into his account:The victim mistakenly deleted Telegram application from his phone thinking that this is going to stop the attacker(s).Second day, the attacker used the victim phone number to spear phish his contacts in Telegram by pretending that the real person is sending a voice message while the file is actually a malicious APK (Android Package) file.This APK file targets only Android-based smartphones. Once the new victim click on the APK file, the application installs itself in the device without any problem and is fully functional. The icon of the application appears in the Apps menu named (URL Shortener).Tel: +965 22445500 | Fax: +1 (888) 4333113 | Email: info@cyberkov.com | Website: www.cyberkov.com45Hunting Libyan ScorpionsThe real malicious code is running in the background as Android service1.1 url +965 22445500 | Fax: +1 (888) 4333113 | Email: info@cyberkov.com | Website: www.cyberkov.com56Hunting Libyan ScorpionsMalware AnalysisCyberkov Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) started analyzing the APK file (malware) and the first step was to unpack it.After unpacking with apktool and reading (AndroidManifest.xml) file, it appears that the application is a malware injected inside a legitimate application having java package name: de.keineantwort.android.urlshortener.Tel: +965 22445500 | Fax: +1 (888) 4333113 | Email: info@cyberkov.com | Website: www.cyberkov.com67Hunting Libyan ScorpionsSearching for the application in Google Play store with that specific package name (url yields:Tel: +965 22445500 | Fax: +1 (888) 4333113 | Email: info@cyberkov.com | Website: www.cyberkov.com78Hunting Libyan ScorpionsThe application exists in the store and the Libyan Scorpions hacking group took an instance of the APK and injected their malware into that legitimate application to spread it.The real application is created by keineantwort.de and we have verified it from their main website:Going back to (AndroidManifest.xml) file, the malware register itself as receiver of almost all intents and request almost all permissions available in Android system!Tel: +965 22445500 | Fax: +1 (888) 4333113 | Email: info@cyberkov.com | Website: www.cyberkov.com89Hunting Libyan ScorpionsTel: +965 22445500 | Fax: +1 (888) 4333113 | Email: info@cyberkov.com | Website: www.cyberkov.com910Hunting Libyan ScorpionsThe malware can access location, network state, battery status, Bluetooth, camera, capturing audio, internet, …, etc.After launching the malicious application for the first time, it checks if the Android device is rooted or not and if rooted, it asks for root permission.Tel: +965 22445500 | Fax: +1 (888) 4333113 | Email: info@cyberkov.com | Website: www.cyberkov.com1011Hunting Libyan ScorpionsCarrying on the reverse engineering of the malware, we found a file called “config.json” which is a base64 encoded json file containing the configuration of the malware and its Command and Control (C2).
