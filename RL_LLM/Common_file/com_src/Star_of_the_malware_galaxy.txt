As a leading scientist in his ﬁeld, such trips were common for Grzegorz. Over the next couple of days, Mr Brzęczyszczykiewicz exchanged business cards with other researchers and talked about the kind of important issues such high level scientists would discuss (which is another way of saying “who knows?”). But, all good things must come to an end; the conference ﬁnished and Grzegorz Brzęczyszczykiewicz ﬂew back home, carrying with him many highlights from a memorable event. Sometime later, as is customary for such events, the organizers sent all the participants a CDROM carrying many beautiful pictures from the conference. As Grzegorz put the CDROM in his computer and the slideshow opened, he little suspected he had just became the victim of an almost omnipotent cyberespionage organization that had just infected his computer through the use of three exploits, two of them being zero-days.A rendezvous with the “God” of cyberespionage2It is not known when the Equation group began their ascent. Some of the earliest malware samples we have seen were compiled in 2002; however, their C&C was registered in August 2001. Other C&Cs used by the Equation group appear to have been registered as early as 1996, which could indicate this group has been active for almost two decades. For many years they have interacted with other powerful groups, such as the Stuxnet and Flame groups; always from a position of superiority, as they had access to exploits earlier than the others.TweetThe #EquationAPT group is probably one of the most sophisticated cyber attack groups in the world #TheSAS2015Since 2001, the Equation group has been busy infecting thousands, or perhaps even tens of thousands of victims throughout the world, in the following sectors:Government and diplomatic institutions Oil and gas Islamic activists and scholars Companies developing encryption technologiesTo infect their victims, the Equation group uses a powerful arsenal of “implants” (as they call their Trojans), including the following we have created names for: EQUATIONLASER, EQUATIONDRUG, DOUBLEFANTASY, TRIPLEFANTASY, FANNY and GRAYFISH. No doubt other “implants” exist which we have yet to identify and name.TweetThe #EquationAPT group interacted with other powerful groups, such as the #Stuxnet and #Flame groups #TheSAS2015The group itself has many codenames for their tools and implants, including SKYHOOKCHOW, UR, KS, SF, STEALTHFIGHTER, DRINKPARSLEY, STRAITACID, LUTEUSOBSTOS, STRAITSHOOTER, DESERTWINTER and GROK. Incredible as it may seem for such an elite group, one of the developers made the unforgivable mistake of leaving his username: “RMGREE5“, in one of the malware samples as part of his working folder: “c:\users\rmgree5\“.Perhaps the most powerful tool in the Equation group’s arsenal is a mysterious module known only by a cryptic name: “nls_933w.dll“. It allows them to reprogram the hard drive ﬁrmware of over a dozen diﬀerent hard drive brands, including Seagate, Western Digital, Toshiba, Maxtor and IBM. This is an astonishing technical accomplishment and is testament to the group’s abilities.Over the past years, the Equation group has performed many diﬀerent attacks. One stands out: the Fanny worm. Presumably compiled in July 2008, it was ﬁrst observed and blocked by our systems in December 2008. Fanny used two zero-day exploits, which were later uncovered during the discovery of Stuxnet. To spread, it used the Stuxnet LNK exploit and USB sticks. For escalation of privilege, Fanny used a vulnerability patched by the Microsoft bulletin MS09-025, which was also used in one of the early versions of Stuxnet from 2009.LNK exploit as used by FannyIt’s important to point out that these two exploits were used in Fanny before they were integrated into Stuxnet, indicating that the Equation group had access to these zero-days before the Stuxnet group. The main purpose of Fanny was the mapping of air-gapped networks. For this, it used a unique USB-based command and control mechanism which allowed the attackers to pass data back and forth from air-gapped networks.TweetTwo zero-day exploits were used by the #EquationAPT group before they were integrated into #Stuxnet #TheSAS2015In the coming days, we will publish more details about the Equation group malware and their attacks. The ﬁrst document to be published will be a general FAQ on the group together with indicators of compromise.By publishing this information, we hope to bring it to the attention of the ITSec community as well as independent researchers, who can extend the understanding of these attacks. The more we investigate such cyberespionage operations, we more we understand how little we actually know about them. Together, we can lift this veil and work towards a more secure (cyber-)world.Download “Equation group: questions and answers” PDFIndicators of compromise (“one (.DAT)NameMD5Type_SD_IP_CF.dll – unknown03718676311de33dd0b8f4f18cﬀd488DoubleFantasy installer + LNK exploit IPs):DoubleFantasy:advancing-technology[.]com charging-technology[.]com computertechanalysis[.]com conﬁg.getmyip[.]com – SINKHOLED BY KASPERSKY LAB globalnetworkanalys[.]com melding-technology[.]com myhousetechnews[.]com – SINKHOLED BY KASPERSKY LAB newsterminalvelocity[.]com – SINKHOLED BY KASPERSKY LAB selective-business[.]com slayinglance[.]com successful-marketing-now[.]com – SINKHOLED BY KASPERSKY LABtaking-technology[.]com techasiamusicsvr[.]com – SINKHOLED BY KASPERSKY LAB www.dt1blog[.]com www.forboringbusinesses[.]comEquationLaser:lsassoc[.]com – re-registered, not malicious at the moment gar-tech[.]com – SINKHOLED BY KASPERSKY LABFanny:webuysupplystore.mooo[.]com – SINKHOLED BY KASPERSKY LABEquationDrug:newjunk4u[.]com easyadvertonline[.]com newip427.changeip[.]net – SINKHOLED BY KASPERSKY LAB ad-servicestats[.]net – SINKHOLED BY KASPERSKY LAB subad-server[.]com – SINKHOLED BY KASPERSKY LAB ad-noise[.]net ad-void[.]com monster-ads[.]net quik-serv[.]com ghalibaft[.]comadservicestats[.]com 247adbiz[.]net – SINKHOLED BY KASPERSKY LAB gar-tech[.]com – SINKHOLED BY KASPERSKY LAB serv-load[.]com rapidlyserv[.]comGrayFish:ad-noise[.]net business-made-fun[.]com following-technology[.]com forgotten-deals[.]com functional-business[.]com housedman[.]com industry-deals[.]com posed2shade[.]comquik-serv[.]com unwashedsound[.]comTripleFantasy:arm2pie[.]com tropiccritics[.]comEquation group’s exploitation servers:standardsandpraiserepurpose[.]com technology-revealed[.]comIPs hardcoded in malware Backdoor.Win32.Laserv.b Exploit.Java.CVE-2012-1723.ad HEUR:Exploit.Java.CVE-2012-1723.gen HEUR:Exploit.Java.Generic HEUR:Trojan.Java.Generic HEUR:Trojan.Win32.DoubleFantasy.gen HEUR:Trojan.Win32.EquationDrug.gen HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic HEUR:Trojan.Win32.GrayFish.gen HEUR:Trojan.Win32.TripleFantasy.gen Rootkit.Boot.Grayﬁsh.a Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Agent.bjqt Trojan.Boot.Grayﬁsh.a Trojan.Win32.Agent.ajkoe Trojan.Win32.Agent.iedc Trojan.Win32.Agent2.jmk Trojan.Win32.Diple.fzbb Trojan.Win32.DoubleFantasy.a Trojan.Win32.DoubleFantasy.gen Trojan.Win32.EquationDrug.b Trojan.Win32.EquationDrug.c Trojan.Win32.EquationDrug.d Trojan.Win32.EquationDrug.e Trojan.Win32.EquationDrug.f Trojan.Win32.EquationDrug.g Trojan.Win32.EquationDrug.h Trojan.Win32.EquationDrug.i Trojan.Win32.EquationDrug.jTrojan.Win32.EquationDrug.k Trojan.Win32.EquationLaser.a Trojan.Win32.EquationLaser.c Trojan.Win32.EquationLaser.d Trojan.Win32.Genome.agegx Trojan.Win32.Genome.akyzh Trojan.Win32.Genome.ammqt Trojan.Win32.Genome.dyvi Trojan.Win32.Genome.ihcl Trojan.Win32.Patched.kc Trojan.Win64.EquationDrug.a Trojan.Win64.EquationDrug.b Trojan.Win64.Rozena.rpcs Worm.Win32.AutoRun.wzsYara rules:1 copyright = “Kaspersky Lab” description = “Rule to detect Equation group’s Exploitatio version = “1.0” last_modified = “2015-02-16” reference = “url” $a1=“prkMtx” wide $a2=“cnFormSyncExFBC” wide $a3=“cnFormVoidFBC” wide (($mz at 0) and any of ($a*)) copyright = “Kaspersky Lab” description = “Rule to detect DoubleFantasy encoded config version = “1.0” last_modified = “2015-02-16” reference = “url” $a1={06 00 42 00 49 00 4E 00 52 00 45 00 53 00} $a2=“yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy” $a3=“002”18 (($mz at 0) and all of ($a*)) and filesize &lt; 500000 copyright = “Kaspersky Lab” description = “Rule to detect the EquationLaser malware” version = “1.0” last_modified = “2015-02-16” reference = “url” $a1=“?a73957838_2@@YAXXZ” $a2=“?a84884@@YAXXZ” $a3=“?b823838_9839@@YAXXZ” $a4=“?e747383_94@@YAXXZ” $a5=“?e83834@@YAXXZ” $a6=“?e929348_827@@YAXXZ” any of them copyright = “Kaspersky Lab” description = “Rule to detect the crypto library used in E version = “1.0” last_modified = “2015-02-16” reference = “url” $a={37 DF E8 B6 C7 9C 0B AE 91 EF F0 3B 90 C6 80 85 5D 19 pseudonym, to protect the original victim’s identity >> 2 the name “Equation group” was given because of their preference for sophisticated encryption schemes >>APT CYBER ESPIONAGE EQUATION FLAME GAUSS SPYWARE STUXNET TARGETED ATTACKSShare post on:  Related PostsHappy IR in the New Year!Kaspersky Review of the spywareTHERE ARE 28 COMMENTSlynx Posted on February 17, 2015. 4:58 amOk, reading through NSA ﬁles that Der Spiegel released i found this:url is a ﬁle that shows the job postings for NSA interns, you can ﬁnd a NSA wiki link in the last page. And this is very interesting:(TS//SI//REL) Create a covert storage product that is enabled from a hard drive ﬁrmware modiﬁcation. The ideia would be to modify the ﬁrmware of a particular hard drive so that it normally only recognizes half of its available space. It would report this size back to the operating system and not provide any way to access the additional space.This is a 2006 document, it took 8 years to ﬁnish this product, which is what kaspersky found.So maybe you guys would easily ﬁnd the malware if you revert the ﬁrmware to a state prior of this date.REPLYBildos Posted on February 17, 2015. 6:43 amFirmware – deﬁnitely it’s something what AV should start to scan / check. Yes it’s not easy task but absolutely needed to provide protection. What’s required to check? Firmware modiﬁcations- to verify if we have version in 100% conﬁrmed by vendor.REPLYpj Posted on February 17, 2015. 9:13 amI’ve read that most hard drive ﬁrmware is write-onlyREPLYNigel Tolley Posted on February 17, 2015. 1:14 pmI think you may have got that backward. But it’s wrong either way.The whole point of this is that they (NSA) have worked out how to re-write the HDD ﬁrmware, which is usually just about impossible. Then it is read every time the disk is used, if they want. Your AV can’t see it, & it wouldn’t shock me if they had ﬁgured out a secondary way to send the data out.In fact, if they’ve secretly halved the disc capacity they could just store the unencrypted data on the half you can’t delete!REPLYMegaByte Posted on September 24, 2016. 8:51 amWe can use the whole HD. There is a percentage of the HD that is not usable. Perhaps the NSA hides out (Or could hide out) in that unusable space?REPLYCostin Raiu Posted on February 19, 2015. 12:57 pmThe problem comes from the fact there’s a standardized API to write the ﬁrmware but no API to read it. This means we can’t easily check if a HDD has been compromised. Several suggested solutions from our side include: ﬁrmware signing and checking on the disk side, ﬁrmware write-protect switch on the HDD and the ability to read the ﬁrmware easily and check for alterations.REPLYRoger Jollie Posted on February 17, 2015. 3:42 pmI’m surprised someone like OnTrack or other companies that recover hard drives have not found items on this “empty space”.REPLYMike Smitheee Posted on February 17, 2015. 7:57 pmNot really surprising when you think about it. If the world-wide infection rate is in the 10’s of thousands, then lets assume that 10,000 of those are in the US, where data recovery is most prevalent. If that’s the case, then there would still only be about a 0.004% chance of a particular machine being infected. Now, if you take that and extrapolate out the likelihood of the particular infected machine requiring a DRS, which is extremely expensive and would only be used in those cases where critical data was unrecoverable, had not been backed up in some other fashion, and/or was not otherwise replicate-able by the user.If we roll that to oh say 1 in 100 which is EXTREMELY low, then you’re now looking at a 0.00004% chance or about a 1 in 2.5million, that a DRS service would even lay their hands on an infected device. Then… they have to actually notice it.REPLYRyan Posted on February 17, 2015. 7:40 pmCan Kaspersky give a timeline of discoveries? Where you aided by the discovery of BadUSB?REPLYGSK Posted on February 17, 2015. 7:56 pmIf Kroll OnTrack ever did run across this, they probably wouldn’t report it. They are a DoD cleared contractor and are used to recover data from damaged classiﬁed hard drives.REPLYGordon Posted on February 17, 2015. 9:33 pmMaybe you never heard about Rakshasa malware: url hardware-backdoor-that-china-could-embed-in-every-computerIt can hide himself also in your graphic card bios and, most important, it CANNOT BE REMOVED.REPLYdave Posted on February 17, 2015. 10:32 pmI wonder what the situation on Linux is. Obviously the new ﬁrmware will only be controlled by a windows only stack of exploits even in a dual boot situation , but is Kaspersky aware of any possible tampering of binary distributed packages in linux major distributions, so that an equivalent infection can act on a linux system ? what is the probability of that ?REPLYwondering Posted on March 4, 2015. 2:59 pmI’ve thought that perhaps Linux’s main backdoor now is called “systemd” – since it’s VERY odd to see such rapid adoption of an unknown package(s) curated/written/compiled by only a few people whose goals are not clear. And with only approx. 3 major Linux bases (Fedora, Debian, etc) the NSA etc only had to convince one of them to get a back door(s) included as a “dependency” and now, poof, you have the same problem as Windows in loading components you can’t completely check, an enlarged attack surface, and partially closed code.Perhaps I am wrong, or slightly oﬀ as to where these backdoors are in Linux, but if I were a betting man then systemd is to me Linux’s downfall.REPLYPaul Williams Posted on February 18, 2015. 1:07 amRoger, the kinds of targets tat Equation are aiming to infect (high- value data) are probably not the sorts of targets who will happily give up a hard drive containing high value data to companies such as OnTrack. With only a few tens of thousands of infected targets globally, I’m not surprised that this has been secret until recently.REPLYLow Value Target (but a target nonetheless) Posted on March 16, 2015. 5:53 pmPaul, I found out recently from a security professional – a very reliable source, who has examined samples from my systems directly on several occasions – that the malware complex about which I have been ﬁghting and collecting forensic evidence (in my own amateurish but tenacious fashion) for the better part of a decade…it strongly resembles this type of coordinated “omnipotent” attack.Everyone thought I was crazy until last month (which I am, but it has become clear from evidence and analysis of trusted advisers that my problems are not imagined) – everyone kept telling me it was physically impossible that a boot/rootkit could and would ﬂash ﬁrmware (deﬁnitely many HDD’s, deﬁnitely router ﬁrmware & a customized install of a new router microOS, deﬁnitely some/all of a motherboard’s ﬁremware, and – for certain – at least one AIO printer’s ﬁrmware) and deny me access to my own BIOS’s with the use of fake bios’s… starting when I ﬁrst started documenting my digital woes back in 2009-2010 or so. Symptoms of`infection in my situation include infected image ﬁles, infected .lnk’s/.ico’s (despite disabled autorun), ghost drives, computers booting from ramdisks (when no storage media was connected, or booting from ramdisk OS despite boot menu instructions to boot from a live rescue disk instead), HDD’s refusing to wipe (DBAN failures, among other methods tried) and so on…I just wish I knew how to reach reputable/trustworthy (veriﬁably so) security researchers in the Paciﬁc Northwest, to give copies of all the hard (literally – paper printouts of camera images and dump ﬁles) evidence I have of my own situation, to maybe give myself hope I will eventually be able to “pwn” MY OWN DEVICES back under my own control someday. I’m tired of running only zombies in this house. Or at least help others avoid my own fate in the future. Who can someone turn to, when you can’t even trust a search engine, e-mail provider, cell phone service, or the postal service anymore?REPLYblackwater Posted on February 18, 2015. 6:24 amurl nsa isnt the only one capable of doing this sort of thingwhat im wondering is why you make claims that this malware would be so hard to remove when you can simply use publically accessible tools to re-ﬂash clean working ﬁrmware to the hdd microcontroller, have you seriously not done research on this or are you just trying to spread propaganda by making users believe there is nothing that can be doneREPLYCostin Raiu Posted on February 19, 2015. 1:02 pmThanks for your comment. Based on our experience, re- ﬂashing the ﬁrmware doesn’t seem to always help. There are certain areas in the ﬁrmware which do not get updated. In another case, the ﬁrmware update didn’t work because it was “already the latest version”. Yet another problem is that it’s not so healthy to keep reﬂashing the ﬁrmware every day and leave under a constant fear that it has been infected since the last re- ﬂash. I think we need reliable means to check if the ﬁrmware was compromised and better defense against such attacks instead of wearing down the ROM of your HDD.REPLYMoritz Kroll Posted on February 18, 2015. 1:06 pmYou forgot moretimeads.com in the list of DoubleFantasy CnCs, although you sinkholed it yourself   Posted on February 19, 2015. 3:59 amSo if it’s based on Israel and the US’s prior malware, and it’s not directed against Israel but Islam, and nanotechnology, with all due respect, this is another Israel/US joint. Who stands to gain? And who invented it? Therefore who is ultimately responsible?REPLYcpuvirtual Posted on February 19, 2015. 5:40 pmGreat Job!Will the german people come back to the paper, pencil and rubber ?Only time will tell !haltREPLYRussel Future Posted on February 19, 2015. 5:56 pmThx to K. Group for this research and result. Flashed HDD ﬁrmware cannot typically be read. Its a one-way action, so it is an obvious good place to hide malware. I am interested in “Joey”‘s questions. Who invented this suite, and as my old legal friends say, cui bono? If this is another USA-Israel joint venture, it would be useful and helpful to have proof, or at least some direct evidence. We will be having an election soon in my country, and this sort of risk factor to our economy will be an election issue. Most folks don’t care about security and spycraft issues until they are on the wrong side of a bad scenario. But for folks who do care, they care deeply. There is suspicion by some folks that our ﬁnancial markets have been compromised by modern methods. Information about this exploit makes it very clear that this concern is not idle fear.REPLYShane Posted on March 16, 2015. 5:19 pmI am skeptical of the idea that this comes from any government in particular.For one, the coding is simply too smooth. DoD, CIA, and NSA cyber-anything has lagged behind the civilian world since the 90s. The coding was almost certainly a private entity operating under contract or from a private group of benefactors (the targeting of Iran despite the ﬁckle nature of DC politics suggests another principle is at play).The NSA also lacks the human intelligence resources to plant a virus on a commercial printing of CDs. I contend that private entities have supplanted even the CIA in developing human intelligence and operator networks. Such networks would also be easily capable of accessing government archives of source code samples. The government rarely understands the market value of the things it so poorly secures after forcing them from companies.The callback servers are easily operated and maintained by small private entities whose admins don’t even need to know what it is for.The data retrieved is valuable to many diﬀerent private entities. Northrop would be interested. Boeing, Sukhoi, Mikoyan-Greivich… any large defense contractor would be willing to pay for information related to the topography of a network or some of the data they are working on.Remember when Lockheed suﬀered from the massive data breech related to the F-35? Then the new super- sized F-35 China started playing with?The recent ruling by the FCC is typical government intrusion – but the sudden nature of it, I would argue, is an attempt to get a hold on the call-back servers for these types of threats. Though it may not be eﬀective – it is classic government logic that I would argue indicates they are -not- in control of these groups and honestly have no idea how it is they are accomplishing what they are.Further evidence can be supplied by a war-games trial run between the Active Duty Navy ITs and the Reserve- side ITs – who were civilian IT security, as well.The Active duty didn’t even know what hit them – had no idea how they were compromised.Obviously – it is mostly conjecture…But if you look at the platform, it is a virtual “Sword of Damocles” – it can sit quietly on systems for years – giving information that is marketable while also giving the operator the ability to carry out “hits” for no additional cost. If a customer is willing to pay to embed a virus – or someone else has a virus they wish for you to embed – then you have the perfect delivery platform.A state tends to have a more results-driven approach – using operators to physically infect a system with a single objective. Ten years is a -long- time in politics, and a project with a pay-oﬀ 8 years down the line gets the seating oﬃcial 3 terms behind yours the cookie.The more I look at it – the more this looks to be a business model.“But only in Iran?”Iran has no choice but to turn to outside IT sources like Kaspersky. Boeing could be rife with this thing and we would never know it unless news of major data breaches get out (F-35 for Lockheed). Business is equalopportunity. The Chinese are just as willing to pay to play as the U.S. is – or as Blackwater/XE is regarding a planned operation.There is a lot more money to be made in cyber- espionage than the government has to waste on it.Not to say that the government wouldn’t be interested in being a customer of such a business….REPLYMarki Posted on February 19, 2015. 7:26 pmVery interesting thing to silently ﬂash parts of a HDD ﬁrmware – I had a short peek into the circulating samples of EquationDrug and GrayFish. I couldn’t ﬁnd a place where stands “SAMSUNG” or “WDC” in any of these samples.To be sure that I grabbed valid ﬁles I also looked for the string “GROK” in another sample and found it – so the collection seems valid …So – what part of what sample is shown in the report on page 17 ??appreciate any feedbackREPLYCostin Raiu Posted on March 4, 2015. 8:45 amHi Marki,Thanks for your comment! Unlike the “GROK” string, the strings from NLS_933W are encrypted, so you’d have to decrypt them ﬁrst. We provide an MD5 for NLS_933W in the blog.Good luck!REPLYREPLYTheodis Butler Posted on February 21, 2015. 5:51 amHoly ShitA. Nolen Posted on March 23, 2015. 4:04 pmThis report and the work you detail in the post are awesome achievements Costin; congrats to you and the team at Kaspersky. Have you or Kaspersky Labs received any blowback from either the US government, or any organization, for making these revelations?REPLYArturo Spinoza Posted on March 23, 2015. 6:58 pm‘Holy Shit’ doesn’t begin to describe it. Kaspersky is right, we need to band together to ﬁght this.REPLYalexander Posted on April 12, 2015. 5:58 pmHaving read this and further articles about Equation group, I made a conclusion that the user computer security should be considered complexly from from the computer turning on to standard user actions in the operating system. That is why I want to know answers on these 10 questions: 1. Can usual antivirus check ﬁnd all the harmful software of Equation Group family, if the check has tough options? 2. Can Equation group software patch system drivers, hard drive ﬁrmware and make other changes in OS booting when Secure boot is on and Kaspersky Internet Security with ELAM support is used? 3. If they can, are these changes ﬁxed under question 2 conditions? 4. If the software acts successfully and no changes ﬁxed by Secure boot or KIS, can TPM module ﬁx them? 5. Do the components of Equation Group interact in the Oeration system environment or within internal family structure (directly between each other)? 6. Will new publications about the Grayﬁsh and its main diﬀerences from the Equationdrug be? 7. Please give the list of hard drives models with changed ﬁrmware. 8. Can the core and components of the Equation Group mask themselves and other components to become unvulnerable for proactive defence and behavioral analysis? This is about all the components and any antivirus or antispyware. First of all I mean software control function of Kis or HIPS in the Comodo Internet Security. 9. What signs can be used to deﬁne the patching of the drive ﬁrmware exactly or with high possibility? Can it be some ﬁles in the system or virtual ﬁle system? 10. Can the such software as 7datarecovery or other like it ﬁnd such a virtual system? 11. Does Kaspersky Laboratory know about the development andimplementation of the technologies complicating the ﬁrmware patching by hard drives producers?REPLY
