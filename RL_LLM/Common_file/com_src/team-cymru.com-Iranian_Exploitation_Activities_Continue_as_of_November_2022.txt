In recent reporting, PHOSPHORUS TTPs have included the likely opportunistic targeting of unpatched vulnerable systems, leveraging common exploits such as Log4J and ProxyShell.Reports published in 2022 (for instance by the DFIR Report and Deep Instinct) have highlighted the long- names, for example:kcp53.mssync[.]onetcp443.mssync[.]onetcp443.symantecserver[.]cotcp.newdesk[.]topkcp53.newdesk[.]topwork.newdesk[.]top1/4tcp443.newdesk[.]toptcp443.aptmirror[.]eukcp53.aptmirror[.]eutcp443.msupdate[.]uskcp53.msupdate[.]usReporting by Secureworks suggested that PHOSPHORUS domains from this attack cluster were, in general, registered with Porkbun, and that some of the domains were also associated with opportunistic ransomware attacks.However, between 30 June 2022 and 06 July 2022, the domains aptmirror[.]eu, msupdate[.]us, and newdesk[.]top (mentioned above) were re-registered with NameSilo. The domains were previously outdated/unpatched version of Microsoft Exchange running on the victim IP.The activity likely indicates the malware in use relies on a hardcoded IP address vice domain resolution for ongoing C2 communications. The use of binaries with hardcoded IP addresses is a known TTP of the threat actor and was described in the previously mentioned Secureworks report.Secondly, the victim also communicated over the same ports (TCP/443 and UDP/53) with an IP address assigned to Kaspersky. It is possible these connections equate to behavior observed in previous PHOSPHORUS samples, whereby the malware would seek to communicate with legitimate Kaspersky domains. Connections to domains such as kcp53.kaspersky[.]comand tcp443.kaspersky[.]com are potentially a means of masking malicious communications with similarly constructed domains (see the PHOSPHORUS malware with generating many connections to legitimate companies along with connections to attacker-controlled domains to confuse a network defender into categorizing the traffic as authentic traffic.It is worth noting that the Kaspersky IP hosted both kcp53.kaspersky[.]com and tcp443.kaspersky[.]com, as well as other domains, at the time these connections were observed.Thirdly, the victim also communicated with TCP/443 of an IP address assigned to Cloudflare. At the time of these connections, the Cloudflare IP hosted numerous domains including api.myip[.]com.As noted in the previously referenced DFIR Report research, PHOSPHORUS malware was observed resolving the domain api.myip[.]com in the past. It is therefore possible that these connections are indicative of similar behavior â€“ a step likely undertaken by the attackers to enrich their understanding of the victim host.A diagram of the network activity documented above is provided below.3/4Figure 2: Network Telemetry Mapping of Victim CommunicationsIn addition to the South Asian victim, potential victims in Africa and the Middle East were also observed offering a free external attack surface assessment as part of our Pure Signal Orbit evaluation experience, UDP/53.4/4
