Following our preliminary analysis, we assessed with high conﬁdence that the sample was used to target a previously unreported German chemical company. As part of our responsible disclosure, we alerted the affected entity, the local Law Enforcements, and our clients. In the following weeks after our internal reporting, the German news media source Tagesschau reported our initial detection and analysis of the sample, and conﬁrmed the chemical company’s awareness of the attack in the second half of 2019. The Winnti sample we analysed was highly likely developed in 2015, and likely used around this year for the ﬁrst time, it is unclear how long the compromise existed in the compromised environment. Although the malware was likely used years ago, further analysis revealed a previously unreported C2 technique never attributed to any Winnti Group’s toolkits. The technique relies on a DNS Tunneling communication channel through a custom implementation of the iodine source code, an open-source software that enables the tunneling of IPv4 data through a DNS server. Additionally, we uncovered a previously unknown stolen digital certiﬁcate being used to digitally sign Winnti-related attack components, and the targeting of a previously-unreported South Korean video game company. The sophistication of the techniques we uncovered conﬁrms that the Winnti Group is a highly sophisticated, and highly committed Advanced Persistent Group targeting a plethora of different industry sectors in Europe and South Asia.Introduction The Winnti Group (also known as APT41, BARIUM, and Blackﬂy) is an alleged Chinese state- sponsored umbrella organization in China’s intelligence branch linked through their use of shared goals and attack resources. The suspected state-sponsor link to China’s government pinpoints that it likely has an incentive to continue targeting a variety of industries, especially one’s highlighted as priority for China’s economic development.On Friday, 13 January, QuoIntelligence (QuoINT) detected a new Winnti sample uploaded to a public virus scanner from a German location.

Additionally, during our analysis we uncovered a previously unknown stolen digital certiﬁcate being used to digitally sign Winnti related drivers, and a potential campaign against an already known South Korean video game company.In the last year, researchers and journalists have publicly disclosed that the Winnti group targeted and eventually compromised Henkel (2014), BASF (2015), Bayer (2018) and Roche (2019). This most recent previously unreported German chemical company is yet another German chemical company targeted by Winnti since 2015. Prior to our analysis this attack activity was not publicly reported.Figure 1: Timeline of attacks located in Germany and attributed to WinntiIn December 2019, Germany’s Federal Ofﬁce for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) released a report related to the alleged Chinese state sponsored umbrella organization known as the Winnti Group. Through our internal malware analysis, we are conﬁdent that the sample we discovered is highly similar to the Winnti sample described in the BfV report. The sample also matches known characteristics of Winnti’s arsenal shared through intelligence reports produced by ESET.Further, we have informed the affected company, law enforcement agencies, and sent a Warning to our customers upon detection. The Winnti Group The Winnti Group (also known as APT41, BARIUM, and Blackﬂy) is an alleged Chinese state- sponsored umbrella organization in China’s intelligence branch linked through their use of shared goals and attack resources. Notably, various operations attributed to other China-linked threat actor groups, such as APT17 and Ke3chang, have also leveraged its backdoor malware. Active since at least 2010, initial attacks attributed to the group heavily targeted the gaming industry. However, as researchers have continued to follow and dissect the group and its activity, the group’s target focus has expanded to other industries, including chemical, pharmaceutical, technology, and software. Further, the group’s evolution involves the enhancement, development, and inclusion of new tools and tactics.The suspected state-sponsor link to China’s government, pinpoints that it likely has an incentive to continue targeting a variety of industries, especially one’s highlighted as priority for China’s economic development. In the latest Winnti Group public report, FireEye researchers reported ofurl GROUP: Insights From the Past — QuoIntelligence - Our Finished Intelligence, Tailor-made for Your Organizationa new widespread campaign attributed to APT41 which involves exploitation attempts of recently disclosed and patched vulnerabilities for products of Cisco, Citrix, and Zoho. The campaign waves apparently take a more targeted approach to selecting potential victims across various sectors including ﬁnancials, government, and information technology. According to the researchers, identiﬁed victim systems demonstrated the threat actor leveraged commercially available post exploitation tools such as Cobalt Strike and Meterpreter, which are essentially full featured backdoors. Technical AnalysisSample Targeting German Chemical Company The main artifact uploaded to VirusTotal is a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) ﬁle, with a compilation timestamp suggesting the sample was built in August 2015. Although the compilation time might name2015-08-06 01:52:51TmPfw‐ RVS.dllSimilar to other Winnti samples, the conﬁguration section contains a string referring to the name of the campaign. In this case, at 0X020, the referred campaign name is the name of the chemical company – redacted for the purposes of this blog.Figure 2 – Extracted conﬁguration from Winnti sampleThe analysed artifact we observed contains the following binaries listed below, and also aligns with observations in the BfV report.HASHESCompilation 21f0fce31cbeb789862015-08-06 01:52:51TmPfw‐ RVS.dll2015-08-05 12:08:00driver1.sys2015-05-05 11:31:13driver2.sys2014-12-15 16:06:41dseﬁx.exe2008-May-31 02:18:53 UTCvbox‐ drv.sysTable 2 – Additional artifacts contained by temporarily disable the driver signature enforcement on Windows systems by using an included old, legit VirtualBox driver, both signed and exploitable. By running dseﬁx.exe, the malware canurl GROUP: Insights From the Past — QuoIntelligence - Our Finished Intelligence, Tailor-made for Your Organizationbypass driver veriﬁcation and install its own drivers. We identiﬁed the following two drivers which were embedded in the earlier described main artifact. To note that this technique does not work on moden Windows (e.g. Windows 10) – yet another piece of evidence that this malware was designed and used multiple years ago.Analysis of vboxdriverThis is the vulnerable, correctly signed with a digital certiﬁcate, VirtualBox driver that is used for exploitation. It is used regularly by various threat actors, and by the previously highlighted dseﬁx.exe. The driver can also be used to perform the Turla Driver Loader (TDL) exploitation technique, a similar technique as DSEFix.Analysis of driver1.sysIn late 2019, ExaTrack released their analysis of a signed Winnti rootkit previously observed in the wild, which we conﬁrm is essentially the same rootkit driver. The sample is capable of injecting raw packets into the network and receiving special formatted packets. In comparison, our variant has the same exact number of bytes, and there are large parts exactly matching.Analysis of driver2.sysThis rootkit driver seems to be largely the same as driver1.sys with the same characteristics including structure, I/O control, and device strings. However, this driver supports different versions of Windows. It checks for ranges of Windows New Technology (NT) build numbers and returns early. This IP is pushed into a list that is generated by the malware at runtime. Likely, the initiation routine also populates the list with the system’s DNS, and the OpenDNS server is only used as fallback case to ensure the C2 domain gets resolved.The dick[.]mooo[.]com FQDN name is offered by FreeDNS, which is a free dynamic DNS service. Notably, in the last years, multiple researchers have reported Winnti/PlugX C2 hostnames hosted in the mooo[.]com zone. In the code we observed that a dot (.) is enforced before the FQDN. Additional analysis revealed that the malware generates subdomains with base128 encoding, and append them to FQDN.url GROUP: Insights From the Past — QuoIntelligence - Our Finished Intelligence, Tailor-made for Your OrganizationCode 1 – Hostname length restrictionFurther, dots are added into it every 57 characters potentially as a hostname length restriction, suggesting the expectation of long hostnames. We conﬁrm the buffer can support FQDN’s up to 2000 characters.Upon further investigation we found out that the malware includes the open source iodine source code – software that enables the tunneling of IPv4 data through a DNS server. Interestingly, we are not aware of any earlier documentation highlighting Winnti speciﬁcally leveraging iodine for DNS tunneling. However, researchers at the Ruhr University Bochum, while hunting for DNS tunnels, observed APT32 and Wekby APT groups using NULL and TXT records as a C2 communication channel, as well as mentioning the mooo[.]com top level domain in their ﬁndings.The implementation of iodine used in the Winnti sample is integrated and uses some custom wrapper, as evidence by the matching functions we discuss in further detail in the following section.Use of Iodine for C2 DNS TunnelingThe iodine DNS tunneling solution is embedded in the DLL that is initially loaded and executed in memory, and includes at least the following 15 matching functions:Table 3 – Malware DLL FunctionsFor instance, the 64bit executable contains the build_hostname function (Code 2), which corresponds with the older 32bit version (compiled with debug symbols) of iodine 0.6.0 (Code 3):url GROUP: Insights From the Past — QuoIntelligence - Our Finished Intelligence, Tailor-made for Your OrganizationCode 2- iodine_0-6-0_build_hostnameCode 3- iodine_0-6-0_build_hostnameBased on the presence of the functions base128_blksize_enc and base128_blksize_raw, we determined the version used, while not exactly known, is from before May 2017 when a patch removed those functions. Further, comparative analysis indicates that for the implementation of iodine in this Winnti attack operation, there is no perfect match for the two versions having 64bit pre-compiled binaries. This indicates iodine was compiled from source, and it is reasonable it is being used as a library, and not in its normal distribution format of a standalone executable.url GROUP: Insights From the Past — QuoIntelligence - Our Finished Intelligence, Tailor-made for Your OrganizationThe DNS Tunneling technique adopted by the malware through the use of iodine is detailed in the ﬁgure below.Figure 4 – C2 channel over DNS1. The malware generates a hostname and appends it to the embedded C2dick[.]mooo[.]com, and makes a NULL query to the resulted FQDN (e.g. abcde is appended to .dick[.]mooo[.]com). Notably, NULL and TXT DNS request types are iodine’s preferred channels since they are “expected to provide the largest downstream bandwidth”. It is hence not a coincidence that researchers at Ruhr University Bochum also observed an extensive use of NULL request types for DNS Tunneling purposes in their research. 2. The infected host sends the DNS query to one of the DNS servers included in the listpopulated at runtime, eventually to the OpenDNS fallback server. At this point the DNS server executes a recursive DNS query by contacting the Name Servers (NS) of each zone, until the Authoritative NS of dick[.]mooo[.]com is obtained. To note, FreeDNS does provide users the capability to delegate the authority of their subdomains to external NS. In the described scenario, attackers delegated the NS of their subdomain to use their NS as a de- facto C2 server.3. The DNS server returns the authoritative answer by forwarding the content of the NULLrecord type to the infected host. Notably, the legit DNS server acts as a proxy between the infected host and the malicious server, by making impossible for defenders the application of any ﬁltering at the Network (L3) level.The NULL DNS record typeThe implementation of NULL type tunneling can be observed in the following excerpt taken while reversing the malware:url GROUP: Insights From the Past — QuoIntelligence - Our Finished Intelligence, Tailor-made for Your OrganizationThe third argument when calling dns_encode shall be of the type “struct query” from Iodine’s dns.cAccording to common.h, “struct query” is deﬁned as:Since QUERY_NAME_SIZE equals to 512 (4 *128 – integers are 4 bytes) the query[128] call obtained from the reversing activity is indeed the DNS query type.As noted, reversing activity detailed the query[128] value to be 0xa. From Iodine’s windows.h T_NULL is DNS_TYPE_NULLFinally, from Windows’s documentation, DNS_TYPE_NULL is actually a Windows constant equal to 0xaurl GROUP: Insights From the Past — QuoIntelligence - Our Finished Intelligence, Tailor-made for Your OrganizationWinnti Signed Code With Digital Certiﬁcate from IQ TechnologyDuring our analysis of the Winnti sample conﬁgured to target the German chemical company, our comparative analysis of other Winnti related drivers revealed a digital certiﬁcate issued to IQ Technology, a Taiwanese company producing Natural language processing (NLP) and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) software. The rootkit driver aligns with the already known driver1.sys. While it is a known TTP that Winnti attributed attacks have involved stolen digital certiﬁcates for code signing its malware components, the use of this certiﬁcate is not publicly discussed, except for a brief report from a security researcher apparently associated with a Vietnamese security company. Although the report is no longer online, the discussed sample contains a compilation timestamp of August 2015, which is the earliest one observed in the wild that we identiﬁed using this digital certiﬁcate. At the time of analysis, the digital certiﬁcate was already revoked.The sample’s structure, debug symbols, and explanatory debug messages included within suggests it is highly likely be a development version. Additionally, the compilation timestamp indicates the sample was created 20 minutes prior to the driver1.sys. Both samples are highly related, and its contents combined with the date of analysis and reporting essentially solidify that it existed in 2015; however, this does not necessarily corroborate to an attack timeframe. 2016-03-07 09:44:01url GROUP: Insights From the Past — QuoIntelligence - Our Finished Intelligence, Tailor-made for Your OrganizationTable 3 – observed network IoCs in Winnti sampleOn 21 February, we detected the new submission of a 64-bit Winnti executable to a public online malware scanning service. As multiple researchers have reported, Winnti operators embed the name of their target directly into the malware, but in an obfuscated manner.Binary AnalysisThe sample resembles the Winnti Dropper Install.exe described by ESET, since it is a command line executable used to drop and load additional encrypted payload:Unfortunately we were not able to ﬁnd the payload meant to be decrypted by this dropper.However, we were able to extract the malware’s conﬁguration ﬁle and identify the intended target. In this case, the following string was included within the extracted conﬁguration:Based on previous knowledge and targeting of the Winnti Group, we assess that this sample was likely used to target Gravity Co., Ltd., a South Korean video game company. The company is known for its Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) Ragnarok Online, which is also offered as a mobile application. As we have also reported in the past, the video game industry is one of the preferred targets of the Winnti Group, especially for those companies operating in South Korea and Taiwan. Interestingly, ESET researchers, while reporting on multiple Winnti Group campaigns targeting the video game industry, listed in their report a C2 server having a Campaign ID GRA KR 0629.Excerpt from ESET Research White paper “CONNECTING THE DOTS Exposing the arsenal and methods of the Winnti Group”At this time, we do not have any further evidence supporting a potential link between the sample we analysed and the C2 detailed by ESET, but the coincidence between the C2 Campaign ID/Location with the Campaign ID we extracted from the Winnti dropper is worth noting. Conclusionurl GROUP: Insights From the Past — QuoIntelligence - Our Finished Intelligence, Tailor-made for Your OrganizationThe Winnti Group has exhibited their ability to breach different organizations and conduct sophisticated attack operations, typically motivated by espionage and ﬁnancial gain, with various TTPs and malware toolkits. While attribution is not concrete due to the complexity of the group, there are links that can be drawn between operations which suggest the threat actors purporting the attacks are likely operating within the Winnti Group, or at least sharing resources.The detection of this unreported Winnti variant uploaded to VirusTotal and targeting a German chemical company aligns with our prior observations and research from previous intelligence reporting highlighting Winnti Group’s interest in German DAX companies. As a result, organizations of all sizes, but especially small to medium sized companies, including Germany’s hidden champions, should prepare against such threats as they are vital to the economic ecosystem and continuous development of niche markets. Government oversight (local, regional, and across the EU) should ensure susceptible organizations such as these are following regulation and implementing security best practices to protect against future attacks.
