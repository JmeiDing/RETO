Based on the project path embedded in the malware, we have named this speciﬁ c campaign “Lurid Downloader” although the malware is typically known as “Enfal”. The majority of the victims are located in Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). We were able to identify 47 victims that include numerous government ministries and diplomatic missions along with space-related government agencies, companies and research institutions in Russia and other members of the CIS along with a smaller amount of similar entities in Europe.The threat actors behind “Lurid Downloader” launched 301 malware campaigns targeting entities in speciﬁ c countries or geographic regions and tracked the success of each campaign by embedding a unique identiﬁ er in each instance of malware and associating it with speciﬁ c victims. While some campaigns resulted in numerous victims, others were very speciﬁ c and targeted resulting in only one or two victims. While previous Enfal activity has been typically associated with threat actors in China, it remains unclear who is behind the Lurid Downloader attacks.3 | RESEARCH PAPERTHE “LURID” DOWNLOADERThe “Lurid” Downloader THREATS TRENDS AND SECURITY ISSUES DIRECT FROM THE EXPERTSINTRODUCTIONPrior to the highly publicized “Aurora” attack on Google in late 2009, which also affected at least 20 other companies, there was little public awareness regarding targeted malware attacks1. However, such attacks have been taking place for years and continue to affect government, military, corporate, educational, and civil society networks today. While such attacks against the U.S. government and related networks are now fairly well-known, other governments and an increasing number of companies are facing similar threats. Russia and other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States are also being targeted and compromised. These countries have an expertise in the space industry and also have operations in oil & gas, mining and other industry areas that have been targeted by malware attacks in the past.Malware attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in popular software in order to compromise speciﬁ c target sets are becoming increasingly commonplace. These attacks are not automated or indiscriminate nor are they conducted by opportunistic amateurs. Known as targeted malware attacks, these attacks refer to computer intrusions staged by threat actors that aggressively pursue and compromise speciﬁ c targets. Targeted malware attacks are typically part of broader campaigns, a series of failed and success compromises, by speciﬁ c threat actors and not isolated attacks.However, the speciﬁ city of the attacker’s prior knowledge of the victim affects the level of targeting associated with a single attack. As a result, some attacks appear to be less precise, or “noisy”, and are aimed at a broader community. Such “spear phishing” attacks are usually “directed toward a group of people with a commonality” as opposed to a speciﬁ c target but are useful for gaining an initial foothold in a future target of interest2.The malware used in the “Lurid Downloader” attacks is commonly known as “Enfal” and it has been used in targeted attacks as far back as 20063. In 2008, Maarten Van Horenbeeck documented a series of targeted malware attacks that made use the Enfal Trojan to target non-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as well as defense contractors and U.S. government employees4. In 2009 and 2010, researchers from the University of Toronto published reports on two cyber- espionage networks known as “GhostNet” and “ShadowNet” that included malware and command and control infrastructure connected with the Enfal Trojan5. The domain names used by Enfal as command and control servers are, according to U.S. diplomatic cables leaked to Wikileaks, linked to a series of attacks known as “Byzantine Hades.” According to these leaked cables, the activity of this set of threat actors has been ongoing since 2002 and is known as “Byzantine Hades”, and there are subsets of this activity known as “Byzantine Anchor,” “Byzantine Candor” and “Byzantine Foothold”6. However, it is important to note that other than the use of Enfal itself, there appears to be several distinct sets of command and control infrastructure in use and the relationship among the threat actors operating these separate infrastructures remains unclear.The “Lurid Downloader” attacks appear to be another separate, but related Enfal network with a geographic focus. While there is clear evidence that the Tibetan community is also target, the victims of this attack are concentrated in Russia and other CIS countries. Numerous embassies and government ministries have been compromised as well as research institutions and agencies related to the space industry.4 | RESEARCH PAPERTHE “LURID” DOWNLOADERThe “Lurid” Downloader THREATS TRENDS AND SECURITY ISSUES DIRECT FROM THE EXPERTSOur investigation began with an analysis of the “Lurid Downloader” malware. Our objective was to document its functionality and map out its command and control network. While this malware family is well known, there appear to be various associated threat actors using it to compromise targets in various geographic locations. Similar versions of this malware have been used to target both the U.S. government and NGO’s in the past. We could ﬁ nd no direct links between this particular command and control network and the previously discovered ones; we believe that it is most likely a separate, but related network as they appear to each have a regional focus.We uncovered a command and control network that consists of 15 domains names and 10 IP addresses. We were able to retrieve a listing of the compromised computers connecting to these servers. In total, we found 1465 unique hosts (Hostname + Mac address as stored by the C&C) with 2272 unique external IP addresses connecting to the command and control network primarily from Russia (1063), Kazakhstan (325) and Ukraine (102) along with numerous other countries in the CIS (former Soviet Union).We were able to use reverse DNS and WHOIS lookups to determine the identity of 47 compromised hosts. From the victims we were able to identify, there were concentrations of government ministries and diplomatic missions as well as space- related government agencies, companies and research institutions.We found that the attackers embedded campaign codes inside the malware they propagated in order to keep track of the success of their campaigns. In total, we found 301 campaign codes and there are high concentrations of victims within a single country for each instance of the malware campaign indicating that the distribution of the malware is targeted at speciﬁ c countries or regions. In addition, nearly 60% of the campaigns only affected 1 or 2 victims indicating the precision with which the malware campaigns were conducted.1 For the attacks on Google, see url 2 url 3 url 4 url , url url html?storyid=4177 5 While the domain names are present in the GhostNet report, they are not part of GhostNet but a completely different network of command and control servers that are actually associated with Enfal. url and url 6 url url and url | RESEARCH PAPERTHE “LURID” DOWNLOADERThe “Lurid” Downloader THREATS TRENDS AND SECURITY ISSUES DIRECT FROM THE EXPERTSATTACK VECTORIn a typical targeted malware attack, a target typically receives a socially engineered message – such as an email or instant message – that encourages the target to click on a link or open a ﬁ le. The links and ﬁ les sent by the attacker contain malicious code that exploits vulnerabilities in popular software such as Adobe Reader (e.g. pdf’s) and Microsoft Ofﬁ ce (e.g. doc’s). The payload of these exploits is malware that is silently executed on the target’s computer. This allows the attackers to take control of the computer and obtain data from it. The attackers may then move laterally throughout the target’s network and are often able to maintain control over compromised computers for extended periods of time. Ultimately, the attacks locate and ex-ﬁ ltrate sensitive information from the victim’s network.In this case, the delivery mechanism used was an email with a malicious PDF as an attachment. The email had no content, just a subject line and an attachment. The email message was spoofed to appear to be from ohhdl@dalailama.com, the Ofﬁ ce of the Dalai Lama and had a subject of “Tibetan Losar Event on 6 March 2011”. It also contained an attachment named “LOSAR FLYER_edited-3.pdf”.The email was sent using an email provider called Gawab (gawab.com) which is and the email address was emb107@gawab.com. The originating IP address was: by a VPN provider in China7.If the attached PDF is opened with older versions of Adobe reader, malicious code is executed that drop malware on the target’s system. The malware then connects to a command and control server under the attacker’s control. At this time, the target’s THREATS TRENDS AND SECURITY ISSUES DIRECT FROM THE EXPERTSAfter successful exploitation, two malware components are created. One is a dropper (ctfmon.exe) that installs a windows service. The service loads the dropped dll ﬁ le mspmsnsr.dll<long string of characters>. The malicious Windows service stores its conﬁ guration settings in the registry:HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WmdmPmSp\ParametersThis malware identiﬁ es itself as version 2.14. During the course of our investigation, we to the system folder and ensures persistence by changing the common start folder of windows to a special one it creates. It then copies all the usual auto-start items there, as well as itself. The existence of this folder is constantly checked and redone if the user or any program switches it back to normal.The Trojan collects information from the computer and sends it via HTTP POST. The information it collects is the following:• Computer name • MAC address • computer OS and version • IP address and codepage • language of the operating system.It constantly communicates with a C&C server to perform certain info-stealing tasks. The main feature of the Trojan is that all communication is started by the client by http. Firewalls and other security devices will never see any communication from outside in. Even the interactive command line is built this way so everything is done from the inside out. The communication is always encrypted although it’s a simple XOR single- byte encryption. This means that network security devices won’t readily see anything suspicious going on.7 | RESEARCH PAPERTHE “LURID” DOWNLOADERThe “Lurid” Downloader THREATS TRENDS AND SECURITY ISSUES DIRECT FROM THE EXPERTSCOMMUNICATION WITH THE COMMAND AND CONTROL SERVERWhen malware is executed on the target’s system it “checks in” with one or more servers under the control of the attackers. Command and control mechanisms allow the threat actors to conﬁ rm that an attack has succeeded in addition to supplying them with some information about the target’s computer and network. From here on, the client communicates back to the control server expecting a command, allowing the attackers to issue commands to the compromised target.All of the connections to the command and control servers use the HTTP protocol and request speciﬁ c URL paths. On startup, the malware connects to the command and control server and requests the path “/trandocs/mm/” (the path may differ with other samples, for example “httpdocs/mm/ or /iupw82/netstate”). This appears to be a LOGIN connection and the server always responds with “123”. The data transmitted to the command and control server consists of the following:Encrypted Password/<hostname>:<MAC>/<ip address> <actual exe name> <campaign name> <y/n> (sys32time.ini exists? Is it 1Mb or bigger?) <y/n> (ipop.dll exists?) <y/n> (always n in our samples) <malware version> (2.14 or 2.15)The encrypted password at the beginning of the LOGIN packet only appears on version 2.15. The sample we analyzed contains the password “hallelujah” and it is encrypted with “ADD +FAh”. The earlier version, 2.14, does not contain a password at all.After the initial connection, the malware makes two kinds of connections to the command and control server every 2 minutes. The ﬁ rst connection is a KEEPALIVE connection to the URL path “/cgl-bin/Owpq4.cgi”. The malware posts information to the command and control server that identiﬁ es the compromised machine: OS and version, “campaign ID” and malware version. The second connection is an ASKCMD connection to a URL with the path “/trandocs/mm/ <machine_name>:<MAC address>/Cmwhite”. The contents of “Cmwhite” contain commands that are sent by the attackers to the compromised computer. The range of possible commands will be discussed below.When the command ﬁ le, “Cmwhite” is downloaded, the malware ﬁ rst acknowledges the receipt of the command by issuing an ACKCMD connection to “/cgl-bin/Clnpp5.cgi”. Once the command is interpreted and performed, the malware issues a CMDDONE request to “/cgl-bin/Rwpq1.cgi”. It contains the results of the command and, if relevant, a result code that indicates any error encountered. When there is no command set by the attackers for the victim computer, the command and control server returns a “404 NOT FOUND” error page. This is never interpreted correctly as a command and therefore ignored.8 | RESEARCH PAPERTHE “LURID” DOWNLOADERThe “Lurid” Downloader THREATS TRENDS AND SECURITY ISSUES DIRECT FROM THE EXPERTSCOMMANDSThe command packet that is contained within the “Cmwhite” response is encrypted. In the samples we analyzed, it is encrypted with XOR 45h. Other communication packets observed suggest that there are other keys in use but they are always a single byte. Once decrypted, this is what a command packet contains:First two bytes: 40 40. (This is just a magic number). Third byte: Command code. Fourth byte: Return code. (This only used in the CMDDONE packet to indicate error/success). From the Fifth byte on, the command carries parameters, which vary depending on the nature of the command.The range of commands available to the attackers that are enumerated below demonstrate the level of control the attackers have over their victims. In addition to functionality that allows the attackers to send and receive ﬁ les, they are able to activate an interactive remote shell on compromised systems.Range of commandsCommand 01 ECHOIt echoes back the word contained in bytes 5 and 6. There’s another parameter, which is supposed to contain the string “ibme54”. If this is right, it keeps an internal counter of how many of these ECHO packets, it has received.Command 02IPOP LOAD CHECKIt checks if the previous check for the ﬁ le c:\windows\system32\ipop. dll was successful. It returns a y/n condition.Command 03 SEND FILECommand 04RECV FILEWhen the client receives this command, it retrieves a ﬁ le and sends it to the C&C server. The ﬁ lename is a parameter in the command packet.This command has two parameters, the ﬁ lename and the data. The client creates the ﬁ le with the data in the packet. It does this by constantly communicating with a Ufwhite URL. This URL is accessed repeatedly in order to keep receiving chunks of the data ﬁ le and appending it to the ﬁ le. When there’s no more data, the ﬁ le is closed and operation is ﬁ nished. After each packet is correctly received, the client sends a report packet to Clnpp5.cgi specifying that it was Ufwhite who started this operation.Command 05 CMDEXECIt accepts a single command and executes it in the victim system.Command 06 DELETE FILEIt accepts a ﬁ lename string as a parameter. It deletes the ﬁ le.Command 07 MOVE FILEIt accepts two ﬁ lenames. It moves the ﬁ le from source to target destination.Command 09LSCommand 0AINTERACTIVE MODEWhen the client receives this command, its proceeds to list the ﬁ les within a speciﬁ ed directory and sends the list back in a response packet.When the client receives this command, it stays in interactive mode. It starts connecting to Clnpp5.cgi expecting a command. These commands are then executed and error codes sent straight away until an “exit” command is received. The interactive commands have a special tag to set them apart from regular commands. This tag is “1234”. The way this interactive system is implemented is the following: The command is run in the same way as command 05 but the output is redirected to a ﬁ le (c:\Documents and Settings\<user>\ SendTo\msacm.dat). The contents of the ﬁ le are then sent in the return packet to Clnpp5.cgi. Once the “exit” command has been received, this mode is interrupted. While this mode is going on, the Trojan still sends keepalive and regular command requests packets.9 | RESEARCH PAPERTHE “LURID” DOWNLOADERThe “Lurid” Downloader THREATS TRENDS AND SECURITY ISSUES DIRECT FROM THE EXPERTSCommand 0B MKDIRThe client creates a directoryCommand 0ETERMINATE PROCESSCommand 10 EXEC NFALThe client tries to terminate a given thread in the system.When this command is received, the client tries to execute the ﬁ le c:\ windows\system32\nfal.exe. This ﬁ le does not exist on an infected system normally so it must be a placeholder for a command ﬁ le uploaded to the victim.Command 40PINGWhen this command is received, the Trojan just sends back an empty packet with a success code condition.TOOL MARKSThe terms “tool marks” refers to characteristics contained within malware that indicate that they are part of the same campaign or related to speciﬁ c threat actors8. In this case, the attackers left the PDB path in the malware samples we analyzed which indicate the name of the project:e:\programs\LuridDownLoader\LuridDownloader for Falcon\DllServiceTrojan\Release\DllServiceTrojan.pdb e:\programs\LuridDownLoader\LuridDownloader for Falcon\ServiceDll\Release\ ServiceDll.pdbWe named this campaign of targeted attacks “Lurid DownLoader” based on the project one. Often, the malware used in targeted attacks contains one or more command and control locations. By linking together the domain names that are present in related malware samples, along with domain names registered by the same email address and domain names hosted on the same web servers we were able to map out the command and control infrastructure of the attackers.In total, we found 15 domain names associated with the attackers and 10 active IP addresses. The domain names were registered by two different email addresses “bruce_tuner@yahoo.com” and “icqmaster@163.com”.10 | RESEARCH PAPERTHE “LURID” DOWNLOADERThe “Lurid” Downloader THREATS TRENDS AND SECURITY ISSUES DIRECT FROM THE EXPERTSDOMAINS mailru-vip.com yandex-vip.com google-ofﬁ ceonline.com ofﬁ ce-helppane.com foxit-pro.com ymail-vip.com ymail-pro.com yandex-pro.com google-ofﬁ ce.com mailru-pro.comhoticq.com hotoicq.comREGISTRATIONSxiaohu wang bruce_tuner@yahoo.com +86.01089464156 fax: +86.01089464156 bei jing shi beijing beijing 102600 CNjason bush icqmaster@163.com +86.01062311307 fax: +86.01062311307 No.20 Xueyuan Road,Haidian District,Beijing beijing beijing 100083 CNRather than use the “root” domains, the attackers use a variety of sub-domains.

In total, we found 301 campaign codes. This means that the attackers sent out at least 301 different instances of the “Lurid Downloader.” There are high concentrations of victims within a single country for each instance of the malware campaign indicating that the distribution of the malware is targeted at speciﬁ c countries or regions.Campaign All 68 of the compromised counters were in Vietnam.ejun0708ejun0614strongNewDnsejun0509ejun05117-28ejun05030dayaug12.exe63423432292825225 in Russia, 3 in Ukraine and 1 each in Czech Republic, Kazakhstan, Switzerland, Tajikistan and Belarus27 in Russia, 3 in China, 3 in Kyrgyzstan, 2 in Tajikistan and 1 each in UK, US, S.

We found that the attackers often issued the “LS” command to send a directory listing from speciﬁ c directories on the compromised computers back to the command and control server. We also observed the use of the “SEND FILE” that ordered the compromised computers to compress, split and upload speciﬁ c ﬁ les (.rar, .xls, .doc) to the command and control server. However, we were unable to recover the ex-ﬁ ltrated data.15 | RESEARCH PAPERTHE “LURID” DOWNLOADERThe “Lurid” Downloader THREATS TRENDS AND SECURITY ISSUES DIRECT FROM THE EXPERTSATTRIBUTIONDetermining who is ultimately behind targeted malware attacks is difﬁ cult as it requires a combination of technical and contextual analysis and the ability to connect disparate pieces of information together over a period of time. Moreover, any one researcher typically does not necessarily have all these pieces of information and must interpret the available evidence. Too often, the determination of attribution is based on easily spoofed evidence such as IP addresses. While many of these attacks are attributed to China, in this case, the IP addresses of the command and control servers were located in the United States and the United Kingdom. However, the registration information of the domain names used indicates that the owners are in China. In either case, the information is not difﬁ cult to manipulate.The use of “Enfal”, the family of malware to which “Lurid Downloader” belongs, has been historically linked with threat actors in China. In this case, the attack vector that we were able to analyze was related to the Tibetan community which indicates an association with China. However, China was also a victim of “Lurid Downloader.”CONCLUSIONIn this report we have analyzed targeted malware attacks that have compromised sensitive locations in Russia, CIS countries and around the world. The focus of the attacks appears to be on government networks and diplomatic missions as well and research institutions and space related agencies. We found that the attackers engaged in over 300 campaigns and kept careful records of their victims and to what campaign compromised them. Our analysis of the campaigns reveals that attackers engage in attacks that target communities in speciﬁ c geographic locations as well extremely targeted campaigns that only affect one or two victims.The precise nature of targeted malware attacks increases the difﬁ culty of defense. With signiﬁ cant reconnaissance, and possibly information gained from previously successful incursions into the target’s network, the threat actors behind targeted malware attacks are able to customize their attacks to increase the probability of success. Therefore, defenses against targeted malware attacks need to focus on detection and mitigation and not simply on prevention.Through the exposure of the “Lurid Downloader” network, we aim to enable a better understanding of the extent and frequency of such attacks as well as the challenges that targeted malware attacks pose for traditional defenses. Defensive strategies can be dramatically improved by understanding how targeted malware attacks work as well as trends in the tools, tactics and procedures of the threat actors behind such attacks. By effectively using threat intelligence derived from external and internal sources combined with security tools that empower human analysts, organizations are better positioned to detect and mitigate targeted malware attacks.TREND MICRO™TRENDLABSSMTrend Micro Incorporated is a pioneer in secure content and threat management.
