("CHENGDU 404"), a company registered in thePRC and based in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. QIAN has been President of CHENGDU 404;JIANG has been Vice President for the Technical Department; and FU has been Manager for BigData Development.5.CHENGDU 404 has publicly described itself as a network security company,composed of elite "white hat" hackers, which provided defensive and counter-offensive networksecurity services and data analytics services, including penetration testing, password recoveryservices, "mobile device forensics," and other services. The company's website boasted about its"patriotic spirit" and claimed that its customers include "public security, military, and militaryenterprises." The CHENGDU 404 front desk is pictured below.36.However, in addition to any purported "white hat" or defensive network securityservices which it provided, CHENGDU 404 was also responsible for "offensive" network securityoperations. That is to say, CHENGDU 404 employees and officers including JIANG, QIAN, andFU committed, and conspired to commit, criminal computer intrusion offenses targeting computernetworks around the world, including, and as described further herein, over 100 victim companies,organizations, and individuals in the United States and around the world, including in South Korea,Japan, India, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Vietnam, India, Pakistan, Australia, the UnitedKingdom, Chile, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. CHENGDU 404 employees and officersincluding JIANG, QIAN, and FU conspired to commit those computer intrusions, and committedthose computer intrusions, by various fraudulent means, installing malware on protectedcomputers, and obtaining, using, maintaining, and communicating with computer and internetinfrastructure located in the United States or obtained from commercial providers in the UnitedStates. The CHENGDU 404 infrastructure included electronic communications accounts (e.g., e­mail accounts), social media accounts, computer servers, domain names, computer software, andother items.47.JIANG, QIAN, and FU conducted, supported, and conspired to conduct computerintrusions using CHENGDU 404 resources, and by conducting CHENGDU 404 affairs through apattern of illegal activity, including identity theft, access device fraud, computer fraud, wire fraud,and money laundering, and related criminal activity. QIAN led these efforts as the President ofCHENGDU 404, JIANG was a hacker and manager in the Technical Department, and FU was abusiness manager and a manager for "big data" analytics, which could be used, among other things,to analyze an~ exploit data obtained through hacking - and thus serve as a means of identifyingadditional targets, providing actionable information, and maximizing the value of stolen data.Defendants' Backgrounds8.JIANG has been involved with professional computer hacking since at least 2007,when he worked for another PRC-based company that, between 2008 and 2010, advertised on itswebsite that it had established an "offensive hacking group," and described some of its clients as"government agencies." JIANG worked at the company between at least 2007 and 2011. Thesame company employed other computer hackers who collaborated with JIANG, including Zhang Haoran, also known as *~Pt, who worked at the company between 2008 and 2014, and TanDailin, also known as ifiG*, who worked at the company in at least 2011.9.JIANG's professional historyincludes criminal computer hacking andcollaborating with professional computer hackers such as Zhang Haoran and Tan Dailin, butincluding others as well. For example, in November 2012, in a discussion with another hacker,JIANG referred to criminal computer hacking as "his old business." JIANG told his associate thathe had been using phishing websites and spear-phishing e-mails, and was looking to improve hiscomputer hacking skills related to the Linux operating system. The criminal nature of JIANG'sactivities is likewise reflected in June 2012 communications with an associate who was also a5computer hacker, and who was concerned about "0a" ("Gong A"), which is short for 0~ ("GongAn"), the PRC Ministry of Public Security. JIANG advised his associate not to "touch domesticstuff anymore." JIANG's associate agreed, explaining that, if he were to commit such "a crime,[he] couldn't even get out of Sichuan [Province in the PRC]." JIANG boasted that he was "theclassic example of maintaining low key," and claimed that he was "very close" with the "GA",meaning the PRC Ministry of State Security. JIANG and his associate agreed that JIANG'sworking relationship with the Ministry of State Security provided JIANG protection, because thattype of association with the Ministry of State Security provided such protection, including fromthe Ministry of Public Security, "unless something very big happens."10.QIAN's professional history also includes projects supporting the Chinesegovernment. For example, in 2010, in connection with a software development project developedfor the "Chengdu National Secrecy Bureau," QIAN provided an associate with a mock-up of theuser-interface for software which was designed as a "Confidential Information Security Cleanin~Tool" to wipe confidential information from digital media. The mock-up is pictured below:6X"8 ~fMtll2010032O.txt,b ;ttt•fl~tef8atijlm• V2.o ••n•~~m~~•~•Http://www.cdflxln.cn11.Since at least 2012, JIANG and QIAN have been collaborating together. Since thattime, QIAN and JIANG have conducted criminal computer hacking activity, together and withothers known and unknown to the Grand Jury, which has in some instances been tracked bycybersecurity professionals under the threat group labels "APT41," "Barium," "Winnti," "WickedPanda," and "Wicked Spider." QIAN and JIANG have also collaborated with, and usedoverlapping tactics, techniques, procedures, and malware with, other computer hackers, includingZhang Haoran and Tan Dailin, whose activities have been tracked under those same threat grouplabels. QIAN, JIANG, and those other computer hackers carried out their hacking usingspecialized malware, such as malware that ·cybersecurity experts named "PlugX/Fast,""Winnti/Pasteboy," "Shadowpad," "Barlaiy/Poison Plug," and "Crosswalk/ProxIP."12.During 2012 and 2013, when Winnti malware was relatively new and largelyunknown to cyber security researchers, QIAN communicated with and worked with other criminalcomputer hackers on various malicious tools, including malware controller software named7"treadstone." The "treadstone" malware controller software was designed to work with Winntimalware which, at the time, was used only by a small group of hackers - hackers such as QIANand JIANG, and others they associated with.13.FU has been working closely with JIANG since at least 2008, and worked withJIANG at multiple internet and video game related companies. FU has been working with QIANand JIANG together since at least 2013. Before joining CHENGDU 404, FU described himself asa skilled programmer and developer, with expertise in developing search applications, includingsearch applications which helped monitor and report about "internet sentiment."OVERVIEW OF THE CONDUCT14.Between about May 2014 and about August 2020, JIANG, QIAN, and FU, togetherand with others known and unknown to the Grand Jury ( collectively referred to here as "theconspirators"), conspired to commit a sprawling array of computer intrusions targeting protectedcomputers belonging to hospitality, video game, technology and telecommunications companies,research universities, non-governmental organizations, and other organizations around the world,including in the United States and the District of Columbia.15.The conspirators used those intrusions to facilitate the theft ofsource code, softwarecode signing certificates, customer account data, and personally identifiable information ( or "PII"),and to carry out sophisticated "supply chain" attacks, in which a computer intrusion at onecompany was used to as a means ofcqmpromising protected computers belonging to its customers.16.The conspirators also used those intrusions to facilitate other criminal schemes,including ransomware schemes and "crypto-jacking" schemes.17.The ransom ware schemes were extortion schemes, in which the conspirators gainedaccess to protected computers, encrypted data stored on those computers, and thereby renderedthat data inaccessible to those computers' owners. The conspirators would then send a ransom8demand claiming that ifthe victim sent a ransom payment to a designated account, the data wouldbe decrypted.18.The "crypto-jacking" schemes were schemes to gam unauthorized access tothousands of protected computers at a time, and then to use those compromised machines byhijacking their computing power to generate crypto-currency through a process known as "crypto-mining."19.The underlying common goal of the conspiracy was to obtain commercial successfor CHENGDU 404 - and personal financial gain for members of the conspiracy - throughcomputer intrusions targeting protected computers.20.The conspirators obtained initial unauthorized access to protected computers usinga variety ofmeans, including spear phishing e-mail messages, network compromises using exploitcode to compromise vulnerable software, and supply chain attacks. The conspirators typicallysought to convert their initial access into long-term, persistent access using several methods,including by installing, on compromised computers, sophisticated Remote Access Trojan ("RAT")malware, "webshells" which provided unauthorized access to victim networks throughco~promised web servers, and unauthorized Virtual Private Network ("VPN") software.21.The conspirators used command-and-control servers ("C2 Servers") to control theirmalware and communicate with compromis~d protected computers. In some cases, they usedmalware that communicated with those C2 Servers by seeking contact with pre-selected domainnames, which cybersecurity professionals refer to as command-and-control domains ("C2Domains"). The conspirators also used more advanced tradecraft, including command-and-controlweb pages which the conspirators created using legitimate websites, and which cybersecurityprofessionals refer to as "C2 Dead Drops." These web pages, including "profile" pages on9legitimate websites, were surreptitiously encoded with the internet protocol ("IP") addresses of C2Servers.22.The conspirators' tradecraft also included other sophisticated methods, includingstolen code signing certificates used to cryptographically "sign" malware, which fraudulentlyrepresented malware to be legitimate software authored by legitimate software providers. Theirtradecraft also included supply chain attacks carried out using a variety of advanced techniques,including the use of encrypted malicious payloads that would only be decrypted if they wereinstalled on computers operated by high-priority, specifically designated victims.23.The conspirators' tradecraft typically included efforts to obtain and expand theirunauthorized access by stealing means of identification and access devices, including logincredentials, belonging to individuals who had administrative access to victim computer networks.The conspirators were then able to use their expanded access to accomplish the goals of theintrusion, such as the theft of data, additional supply chain attacks, ransomware attacks, or crypto(cid:173)jacking schemes.24.In or about 2019 and 2020, the conspirators also conducted a massive campaign torapidly exploit publicly identified security vulnerabilities. This technique allowed the conspiratorsto hack into protected computers using publicly available exploit code - without using their owndistinctive or identifying malware - so long as the conspirators acted before victim companiesupdated their systems. This campaign included the use of security vulnerabilities such as CVE~2019-19781, CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2019-16920, CVE-2019-16278, CVE-2019-1652/CVE-2019-1653, and CVE-2020-10189. These compromises typically resulted in the installation ofwidely-available RAT malware which was not uniquely used by the conspirators.25.The conspirators executed the conspiracy using infrastructure ofthe type describedin Paragraphs 6 and 21 in the United States, Europe, the PRC, and elsewhere in Asia and the world.10The conspirators obtained that infrastructure for purposes of their computer hacking offenses, andthey obtained it using, among other things, payments from outside of the United States, whichwere made to providers inside the United States.COMPUTER INTRUSION ACTIVITYECS #1 Supply Chain Attack26.ECS #1 was an electronic communications services provider, which was based inEurope and which operated protected computers in Europe, the United States, and elsewherearound the world. ECS #1 developed and distributed software that was popular among individuals,'businesses, and a variety of other organizations.27.Beginning no later than June 2015, the conspirators installed malware on protectedcomputers belonging to ECS #1 and thereby caused ECS #1 computers to communicate with HOPPOINT ONE, a C2 Server in California. The conspirators maintained access to ECS #1 protectedcomputers through at least February 2017, including through the installation and use ofWinnti/Pasteboy malware.28.Between about June 2015 and about February 2017, the conspirators compromiseddozens of protected computers belonging to ECS #1. The conspirators used their unauthorizedaccess to ECS #1 computers to view source code and code-signing certificates belonging to ECS#1, and obtained other valuable business and personal information from protected computersbelonging to ECS #1, including login credentials for customer accounts provided by ECS #1.29.The conspirators subsequently used that information to gain unauthorized access toaccounts, and then the networks, of ECS #1 customers, which consisted of a broad range oforganizations, including, as examples, MANUFACTURER #2 and MEDICAL PROVIDER #3.30. MANUFACTURER #2 was a hardware manufacturer based in the United States,which operated protected computers in California and elsewhere. MANUFACTURER #211specialized in high-end hardware for organizations in the United States and elsewhere around theworld.31.On or about January 12, 201 7, the conspirators gained unauthorized access to anECS #1 account assigned to MANUFACTURER #2. The conspirators exploited that access tocompromise MANUFACTURER #2's protected computers.The conspirators installedWinnti/Pasteboy and Barlaiy/PoisonPlug malware on MANUFACTURER #2's protectedcomputers. The conspirators carried out the intrusion, in part, through HOP POINT ONE.32.By using this malware, the conspirators obtained information through unauthorizedaccess to MANUFACTURER #2' s protected computers.In addition, the intrusion causeddamages to MANUFACTURER #2, including remediation costs, which exceeded $1,000,000.33. MEDICAL PROVIDER #3 was a medical provider and research organizationbased in the United States, which maintained protected computers in the United States.34.On or about May 3, 2018, the conspirators gained unauthorized access to an ECS #1account assigned to MEDICAL PROVIDER #3. The conspirators exploited that access tocompromise MEDICAL PROVIDER #3's protected computers, including a protected computerwhich MEDICAL PROVIDER #3 used for medical research. The conspirators installedCrosswalk/ProxIP malware on MEDICAL PROVIDER #3 's protected computers.Theconspirators carried out the intrusion, in part, through HOP POINT TWO, a C2 Server inCalifornia.35.The conspirators used unauthorized access to accounts provided by ECS #1 inconnection with other criminal schemes. The operations of those schemes were reflected inelectronic communications amongthe conspirators,including November 13, 2017,communications between JIANG and another conspirator associated with CHENGDU 404,referred to here as "HACKER FOUR." During this conversation, JIANG and HACKER FOUR12discussed searching for computers to compromise using unauthorized access to accounts providedby ECS #1. JIANG told HACKER FOUR that it was "easy" to find companies to target bysearching lists of publicly-traded companies .through "stock websites." JIANG told HACKERFOUR to identify such publicly-traded companies, find their website addresses, and then "searchdirectly" for ECS #1 accounts associated with those addresses. In one case, HACKER FOURfollowed JIANG's recommendations and targeted a hotel chain headquartered in Hong Kong, asshown in Table 1.Table 1SenderRecipientTranslated ContentHACKERFOURHACKERFOUR JIANGJIANGJIANGYou're getting addicted to playing with [ECS # 1]. When I first started playing with [ECS #1] I was like that too, hahahaha. Feels kind of like playing lottery.HACKERFOUR JIANGPlan to gather twenty or thirty thousand machines, so there would be some income. What is the other company?JIANGSee if other people have ones to pay.HACKERFOUR JIANGA company in Malaysia, related to cars, don't know the details yet OK, I'm going to get ready and shower first.HACKERI see [HOTEL COMP ANY]FOUR JIANGHotel?HACKERYes .FOURJIANGHACKERLooks like there are plenty of machines HACKERFOUR JIANGFOUR JIANGThat'll work.HACKERI think the libraries will also be valuable FOUR13Table 1SenderRecipientTranslated ContentHACKERJIANGLook up check-in records.FOUR JIANGRight.JIANGHahaha, all rich people.HACKERImagine that, sending mass blackmail emails, hahahahaha.FOUR JIANGThere should be quite a lot to take advantage of from this, just have to figure out how to use it.36.In some cases, JIANG and HACKER FOUR leveraged their unauthorized accessto ECS #1 accounts to compromise corporate networks containing thousands of protectedcomputers, and then used protected computers on those networks to carry out a crypto-j ackingscheme. For example, on December 6, 2017, JIANG advised HACKER FOUR that the "miningis starting to run here, a Singapore domain with over 7000 machines. The last peak number ofonline machines was about 1000. I think the computing power will be lowered significantly.Isuppose a lot are off work now. We should get more domains to increase the computing power.Let's see how the profit is if we get a total of around 10,000 machines." In order to identifyadditional targets, JIANG advised HACKER FOUR that "France and Italy are pretty good, lots ofwell-known corporations, and mostly not in IT Just search for well-known French and Italiancorporations and do those The only thing is that the time difference is a bit troublesome. Goingon [ECS #1] at night happens to be their work hours."37.The conspirators sometimes worked to gain control over "domain controllers,"servers, which many corporate networks used to control security authentication requests and other14privileges for all users within a particular network segment. This access could then be used tofacilitate widespread access to computers that are members ofthe corporate domain. For example,as shown in Table 2, on November 29, 2017, JIANG and HACKER FOUR discussed efforts tocompromise domain controllers at a multinational retailer, based in Sweden, including by stealingpasswords.Table 2SenderRecipientMessage ContentJIANGHACKER JIANGThe [MULTINATIONAL RETAILER] one, did you get the domain controller password? No, don't you have the domain controller machine on your side already? I didn't grab the password.I've been having trouble getting the domain controller of this domain for the past couple of days. It's fucking hard to get. Oh, yeah, but I didn't get the domain password Want the plain text password, right?JIANGI'll take a look in a while.HACKER FOURYeah, because they need the domain controller account to deploy mining programs Targeting Universities38.The conspirators also conducted computer intrusion activity at more than a dozenprominent universities in the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, including, as examples,UNIVERSITY #4, UNIVERSITY #5, HONG KONG UNIVERSITY #6, HONG KONGUNIVERSITY #7, and TAIWAN UNIVERSITY #8.39.UNIVERSITY #4 was a research university in the United States, which maintainedoperations and protected computers in Indiana and elsewhere.1540.In about May 2018, the conspirators installed Crosswalk/ProxIP malware onmultiple UNIVERSITY #4 protected computers, including computers used by individualsassociated with the Departments of Computer Science, Veterinary Science, Pharmacy, andAthletics, as well as a network administrator. The conspirators carried out the intrusion, in part,using HOP POINT TWO.41.On or about May 8, 2019, the conspirators installed a webshell on a protectedcomputer belonging to UNIVERSITY #4. The conspirators carried out this intrusion, in part, usingone of several C2 Servers leased from VPS PROVIDER.42.UNIVERSITY #5 was a research university in the United States, which maintainedoperations and protected computers in Texas and elsewhere.43.Between about 2018 and about 2020, the conspirators- compromised protectedcomputers belonging to UNIVERSITY #5. The conspirators carried out the intrusion, in part,using HOP POINT TWO, as well as C2 Servers leased from VPS PROVIDER.44.During the intrusion at UNIVERSITY #5, the conspirators used VPS PROVIDERservers to browse file servers on the UNIVERSITY #S's computer network. The conspiratorsbrowsed files related to network security at UNIVERSITY #5, as well as data related toGeographic Information Systems, and accessed files containing password data.In all, theconspirators browsed at least 4,200 files and directories on over 75 servers.45.The conspirators also obtained a UNIVERSITY #5 network security applicationdesigned to hunt for malware. The conspirators installed and executed this application on a VPSPROVIDER C2 Server on or about January 10, 2019.46.HONG KONG UNIVERSITY #6 was a university located in Hong Kong. On orabout November 1, 2019, using the open source phishing tool "GOPHISH," and a·C2 Server leased16from VPS PROVIDER, the conspirators sent spear-phishing e-mails to multiple recipients at threeuniversities in Hong Kong, including HONG KONG UNIVERSITY #6.47.HONG KONG UNIVERSITY #7 was a university located in Hong Kong. In aboutJanuary 2020, the conspirators installed PlugX malware on four of HONG KONG UNIVERSITY#7's protected computers. The conspirators carried out the intrusion, in part, using a C2 Serverleased from VPS PROVIDER.48.During the intrusion, the conspirators caused HONG KONG UNIVERSITY #7'sprotected computers to transmit information, including system details and registry information, toa C2 Server leased from VPS PROVIDER. For example, between about January 16, 2020, andJanuary 18, 2020, a C2 Server leased from VPS PROVIDER sent electronic communications to,and received electronic communications from, four of HONG KONG UNIVERSITY #7'sprotected computers.49.TAIWAN UNIVERSITY #8 was a research university in Taiwan, whichmaintained operations and protected computers in Taiwan. In or about 2019, the conspiratorscompromised protected computers at TAIWAN UNIVERSITY #8. The conspirators carried outthe intrusion, in part, through a C2 Server leased from VPS PROVIDER.50.During the intrusion, in about October ~019, the conspirators caused TAIWANUNIVERSITY #8's protected computers to transmit information to a C2 Server leased from VPSPROVIDER. The conspirators obtained extensive information from TAIWAN UNIVERSITY #8protected computers, including over 67,000 photographs with filenames bearing peoples' names.The image depicted below captures a redacted portion of the directory, which included those67,000 images.17Targeting Telecommunications Providers51.The conspirators alsotargeted and compromised prominent electroniccommunications services and telecommunications providers in the United States and around theworld, including in Australia, China (Tibet), Chile, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan,Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. These providers included, as examples, ECS #9,ECS #10, ECS #11, and ECS #12.52.ECS #9 was an electronic communications services provider, which was based inthe United States and operated protected computers in California and elsewhere. ECS #9developed and distributed a popular communications platform:53.On or about April 15, 2015, the conspirators sent a spear-phishing email to ECS #9employees. The header of the e-mail showed that it had been sent from HOP POINT ONE. Thee-mail fraudulently purported to contain a job-seeker's resume. In fact, the e-mail contained amalicious attachment designed to install malware on the recipient's protected computer, and thatinitial malware was designed to facilitate the installation ofa second stage ofmalware. The secondstage malware was designed to cause ECS #9 computers to contact a C2 Dead Drop page. Theconspirators created that C2 Dead Drop page using a website that was popular with informationtechnology professionals.1854.ECS #10 was an electronic communications services and social media providerbased in the United States, with protected computers in California and elsewhere. During 2015,the conspirators targeted protected computers belonging to ECS #10. For example, on or aboutMay 5, 2015, the conspirators sent over 140 spear-phishing e-mails to ECS #10 employees. Thosespear-phishing e-mails contained the same malicious attachments which were contained in thespear-phishing e-mails directed against ECS #9.55.The conspirators also used ECS #10 to register fraudulent communications andsocial media accounts. The conspirators used those accounts to conduct target research and toengage in other activities in support of their hacking. For example, between about July 2017 andDecember 2017, the conspirators registered four social media accounts with ECS #10. Theconspirators obtained their ECS #10 accounts using fake names and other fake personalinformation, and then used those accounts to seek contact with individuals employed byuniversities, manufacturers, hospitality, travel and ride sharing companies, and ECS #10 itself.56.ECS ,#11 was an electronic communications services provider, which operatedprotected computers in the United States, Europe, Asia, and elsewhere. ECS #11 developed anddistributed a popular encrypted communications platform.57.The conspirators compromised protected computers belonging to ECS #11beginning no later than March 2015, and continuing through 2020. During the intrµsion, theconspirators installed Winnti/Pasteboy and other malware on protected computers belonging toECS #11. The conspirators carried out the intrusion, in part, using HOP POINT ONE, HOPPOINT TWO, and C2 Servers leased from VPS PROVIDER.58.The conspirators used their unauthorized access to ECS #11 's protected computersto obtain corporate data, including source code for ECS #11 software, in 2015. The conspiratorscontinued their ECS# 11 intrusion campaign through at least January 2020.1959.In about January 2020, on a C2 Server leased from VPS PROVIDER, theconspirators possessed software which was designed to extract user contact data from protectedcomputers that were ECS #11 servers. The conspirators used C2 Servers leased from VPSPROVIDER to conduct over 4,000,000 queries for ECS #11 user accounts that were linked totelephone numbers in over 200 countries, These queries revealed ECS #11 accounts linked to over700,000 phone numbers with country codes for Russia; ECS #11 accounts linked to over 268,000phone numbers with country codes for Myanmar; ECS #11 accounts linked to over 262,000 phonenumbers with country codes for Iraq; and ECS #11 accounts linked to over 100,000 phone numberswith country codes for Vietnam, Egypt, Algeria, Ukraine, and the Philippines.60.ECS #12 was an electronic communications and telecommunications providerbased in Pakistan.In about April 2019 and May 2019, the conspirators compromised protectedcomputers at ECS #12. The conspirators carried out the intrusion, in part, using C2 Servers leasedfrom VPS PROVIDER. During the intrusion, the conspirators caused ECS #12 servers tocommunicate with C2 Servers leased from VPS PROVIDER. In about May 2019, on a C2 Serverleased from VPS PROVIDER, the conspirators possessed keylogger data which captured thee(cid:173)mail addresses and login credentials of at least three ECS #12 employees.Targeting Non-Profit Organizations61.The conspirators also targeted think-tank, non-profit, and non-governmentalorganizations in the United States and around the world, including, for example, NGO #13.62.NGO #13 was a non-profit organization based in the United States, with protectedcomputers in the District of Columbia.63.In about 2018, the conspirators compromised at least twelve NGO #13 protectedcomputers that were located in the District of Columbia. During the course of the intrusion, theconspirators installed Winnti/Pasteboy and Crosswalk/ProxIP malware on twelve of NGO #13's20protected computers in the District of Columbia, including an e-mail server. The conspiratorscarried out the intrusion, in part, using HOP POINT TWO.64.In about May 2018, as part of the computer intrusion at NGO #13, the conspiratorscaused NGO #13's protected computers in the District of Columbia to communicate with HOPPOINT TWO.Targeting Video Game Companies65.The conspirators also targeted video game companies in the United States andelsewhere, including, as examples, VIDEO GAME COMPANY #14 and VIDEO GAMECOMPANY #15.66.VIDEO GAME COMPANY #14 was a video game company which maintainedprotected computers in Brazil and elsewhere. VIDEO GAME COMPANY #14 was partly ownedby a PRC-based multinational conglomerate holding company which owned or invested insubsidiary companies which specialized in various Internet-related services and products,entertainment, artificial intelligence and technology.· In about April 2015, through unauthorizedaccess to VIDEO GAME COMPANY #14 computers, the conspirators obtained a copy of adatabase containing approxi~ately 25 million records reflecting customer names, addresses,password hashes, e-mail addresses, and other personal identifying information. The conspiratorscarried out the intrusion, in part, using HOP POINT ONE.67.VIDEO GAME COMPANY #15 was a video game company based in the UnitedStates, which maintained protected computers in Washington and elsewhere. On or about June15, 2016, malware was installed on a protected VIDEO GAME COMPANY #15 computer whichwas located in Washington. The conspirators carried out the intrusion, in part, using HOP POINTONE.2168.During the course of the intrusion, the conspirators caused compromised VIDEOGAME COMP ANY#15 computers to seek contact with a C2 Dead Drop page and to communicatewith HOP POINT ONE. The intrusion led to the compromise of dozens of VIDEO GAMECOMP ANY #15 protected computers, as well as the theft oflogin credentials for multiple VIDEOGAME COMPANY# 15 employees.Ransomware Attacks69.In about 2020, in addition to the other types ofcomputer intrusions described above,the conspirators also deployed ransomware and demanded ransom payments from victims,including NGO #16, DEVELOPER #17, and ENERGY COMPANY #18.70.NGO #16 was a global non-profit organization dedicated to combatting povertyaround the world, which maintained protected computers in the United States and elsewhere. Onor about March 8, 2020, using a C2 Server leased from VPS PROVIDER, the conspirators usedthe vulnerability designated CVE-2020-10189 to obtain unauthorized access to an NGO #16protected computer located in the United States. On or about March 23, 2020, the conspiratorsencrypted a compromised NGO #16 computer with ransomware software that displayed a ransomnote. The ransom note demanded payment in exchange for decryption. The note also directedNGO #16 to communicate with RANSOMW ARE E-MAIL ACCOUNT #1 to arrange payment.71.DEVELOPER #17 was a real estate company based in the United States, whichmaintained protected computers in Ohio and elsewhere. On, or about March 8, 2020, using a C2Server leased from VPS PROVIDER, the conspirators used the vulnerability designated CVE-2020-10189 to obtain unauthorized access to a DEVELOPER #17 protected computer located inOhio.
