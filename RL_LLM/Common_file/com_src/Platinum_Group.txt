11/11/2019Titanium: the Platinum group strikes again | SecurelistTitanium: the Platinum group strikes againsecurelist.com/titanium-the-platinum-group-strikes-again/94961By AMR , GReAT on November 8, 2019. 10:00 amPlatinum is one of the most technologically advanced APT actors with a traditional focus on the APAC region. During recent analysis we discovered Platinum using a new backdoor that we call Titanium (named after a password to one of the self-executable archives). Titanium is the ﬁnal result of a sequence of dropping, downloading and installing stages. The malware hides at every step by mimicking common software (protection related, sound drivers software, DVD video During our research we found that the main targets of this campaign were located in South and Southeast Asia.Introduction The Titanium APT includes a complex sequence of dropping, downloading and installing stages, with deployment of a Trojan-backdoor as the ﬁnal step. Almost every level of the system mimics known software, such as security software, software for making DVD videos, sound drivers’url the Platinum group strikes again | Securelistsoftware etc.In every case the default distribution is:1. an exploit capable of executing code as a SYSTEM user 2. a shellcode to download the next downloader 3. a downloader to download an SFX archive that contains a Windows task installation script 4. a password-protected SFX archive with a Trojan-backdoor installer 5. an installer script (ps1) 6. a COM object DLL (a loader) 7. the Trojan-backdoor itselfInfection vector We believe the Titanium APT uses local intranet websites with a malicious code to start Another known way of spreading is the use of a shellcode that needs to be injected into a process. In this case it was winlogon.exe. Unfortunately, we don’t know how the shellcode was injected. See the shellcode description below. 2 – Wrapper DLLs Attackers make active use of various kinds of ‘wrappers’. Each wrapper is usually a COM DLL, with the corresponding exported functions. The main purpose of these libraries is to decrypt and load an encrypted ﬁle (previously dropped somewhere) into the system memory (a payload) and then redirect calls to the wrapper itself to the payload’s exported functions.Another type of wrapper DLL is designed to obtain a command line from its exported function argument passed by a caller and create a new process. 3 – Windows task installer (SFX archive) This is a password-encrypted SFX archive that can be downloaded via BITS Downloader. The password is hardcoded into the downloader that is used to decrypt the SFX archive using the -p command line argument.The main feature of this archive is that it contains the cURL executable code, compiled into a DLL. Its purpose is to install the Windows task to establish persistence in the infected system. 4 – Trojan-Backdoor installer (SFX archive) The backdoor itself uses an SFX archive which must be launched from the command line using a password to unpack it. All paths examples here and there will be for the DVD making software. However, these notes can be also applied to any other known software paths.url the Platinum group strikes again | Securelist5 – BITS Downloader This component is used to download encrypted ﬁles from the C&C server then decrypt and The shellcode itself contains position-independent code and doesn’t require previously loaded libraries (except Kernel32.dll). Its sole purpose is to connect to the hardcoded C&C address, download an encrypted payload (the password-protected SFX archive), then decrypt and launch it using the hardcoded unpacking password. The usual command line is:1 "rundll32 "$temp\IOZwXLeM023.tmp",GetVersionInfo -t06xwsrdrub2i84n6map3li3vz3h9bh4vfgcw"BITS Downloader description The BITS Downloader is a DLL ﬁle which has only one exported function: GetVersionInfoA. The main purpose of this library is to download ﬁles in encrypted form from the C&C and launch them. Execution sequence The ﬁrst thing the downloader does is to check whether it was started using the SYSTEM user. If it was, it launches command line arguments (that were passed to the binary loaded by the downloader DLL) using WMI.If it wasn’t started using the SYSTEM user, the downloader passes command line arguments into the argument parser. -u URL-br GUIDParameter description Speciﬁes a URL address where system information will be sent An additional string that will be appended to a request string to the C&CConﬁrmation URL where the downloader will send various conﬁrmations or request data. Possible to build in two additional conﬁrmation URLs Stop a payload downloading. The GUID parameter must provide a down‐ load task GUIDIf one of these parameters exists, the downloader will collect information about installed antivirus products and send it to the C&C.url the Platinum group strikes again | SecurelistAfter that, it sends the download request to the conﬁrmation URL. In response, the C&C sends a ﬁle that will be downloaded in the %USERPROFILE% directory.To decrypt the downloaded ﬁle, the downloader uses an MD5 hash of the strings’ encryption key. Conﬁrmation URL request and ﬁle downloading This is the structure of the encrypted ﬁle:typedef struct { byte hash[16]; // md5 hash of the following data dword data_size; byte data[data_size]; 9The downloader checks the hash ﬁeld against a calculated MD5 of the data ﬁeld hash, and if the hash is correct, performs the following actions:Appends an extension (DLL or EXE, depending on data type) Stores the downloaded ﬁle in the %TMP% folder using the name % (SystemTimeAsFileTime.dwLowDateTime).%TMPThen the downloader speciﬁes a command line to launch the downloaded ﬁle. If the ﬁle is a DLL, the ﬁnal command line will be:1 "%systemroot%\system32\rundll32.exe %(SystemTimeAsFileTime.dwLowDate‐Time)%.TMP,-peuwewh383eg -t 06xwsrdrub2i84n6map3li3vz3h9bh4vfgcw"If the ﬁle is an EXE ﬁle:1 %(SystemTimeAsFileTime.dwLowDateTime)%.TMP -peuwewh383eg -t06xwsrdrub2i84n6map3li3vz3h9bh4vfgcwAfter that, the downloader deletes itself using the following command line:url the Platinum group strikes again | Securelist1 /c for /L %i in (1,1,100) do ( for /L %k in (1,1,100) do (del /f /q module_path > NUL& if not exist module_path exit /b 0))File launching To launch the downloaded ﬁle, the downloader uses the WMI classes Win32_ProcessStartup, Win32_Process and their methods and ﬁelds. File downloading using BITS To download a ﬁle, the downloader uses the BITS service and its COM interface, called IBackgroundCopyManager.It creates a task with the name Microsoft Download, then speciﬁes remote and local ﬁle paths and timeouts. Windows task installation (SFX archive with cURL) It contains:Launches cURL and obfuscated ps1 scripts cURL executable compiled as a DLL (7.50.3)Name Description f1.ps1 Will be executed after the ﬁrst request to the C&C; decrypts x.dat f2.ps1 Will be executed after the second request to the C&C; decrypts b.dat e.ps1 Contains code that calculates a string for the Authorization ﬁeld of the HTTPheaderh.ps1 Gets information about the system proxy settings e.dllA DLL ﬁle with a single exported function; calls CreateProcessAIt downloads:Source ﬁle x.datDownloaded and de‐ crypted ﬁle u.xmlb.dati.batThe result:DescriptionAES-encrypted ﬁle (see f1.ps1 for decryption algorithm) AES-encrypted ﬁle (the same decryption algorithm)url the Platinum group strikes again | SecurelistName Description i.batPerforms Windows task installationWhen a caller (previous step) executes this archive, it must specify two arguments:Argument Argument with a key to unpack the SFX archive Argument with a long string – AcceptanceID (used in re‐ quests to the C&C)p.bat It launches the h.ps1 script to get information about system-wide proxy settings. After that it launches the e.ps1 script to calculate the SystemID that will be used in requests to the C&C.To send a request, it uses c.dll (which is cURL and has an exported function called Command line arguments:Where:System-wide proxyParameter Description %p3%AcceptanceIDThis request downloads the x.dat ﬁle, and the f1.ps1 script decrypts it into u.xml.

Trojan-backdoor installer The archive unpacks its ﬁles into the following folder (in the case of DVD making software):The archive itself contains:DescriptionName BabyBoyStyleBackground.wmv Conﬁguration data psinstrc.ps1Trojan-backdoor loader Trojan-backdoor Loader installation scriptIn the case of the audio drivers software mimic, it differs only in its installation method compared to DVD making software: the ps1 script uses two known CLSIDs to replace their COM DLL paths with malicious ones. psinstrc.ps1 This is the installer script that registers DvDupdate.dll as the ‘DVDMaker Help’ service, and sets its entry point as the DllGetClassObject name. It requires admin privileges to be executed correctly.The script contains conﬁgurable parameters, so it’s easy to change any of the required parameters for different systems.There are two ways the loader can be installed:url the Platinum group strikes again | SecurelistSystem service, with the DllGetClassObject exported function as the ServiceMain function COM object, by replacing an existing CLSID registry path with its ownDvDupdate.dll This is a service DLL, but with all the same exports you would expect from a COM object. Basically, it’s a payload loader.The whole code is obfuscated with different Windows API calls and loops. It wasn’t designed to confuse a reverse engineer or to make reverse engineering harder, but to bypass some simple AV emulation engines.The ﬁrst exported function for every COM object is DllGetClassObject. DllGetClassObject The loader creates a thread that decrypts the payload, restores its PE and MZ headers, and then loads it into memory and launches it. The payload is encrypted with AES 256 CBC. The decryption key is hardcoded along with other encrypted strings. It doesn’t contain ‘MZ‘ and ‘PE‘ tags that allow it to bypass simple AV engines. After initializing the payload, the loader calls its function with ordinal 1. nav_downarrow.png The payload, with backdoor functionality, is a DLL ﬁle. The malware functionality is in the ﬁrst exported entry only. nav_downarrow.png – Ordinal 1 (Trojan-backdoor main function) The ﬁrst thing that it does is decrypt the other encrypted binary (containing conﬁguration data) from the SFX content:The conﬁguration itself is divided into blocks, and every block has its own index. The payload uses these indices to get a speciﬁc item. The conﬁguration contains:the C&C address trafﬁc encryption key the UserAgent string other less important parametersExecution thread The execution thread is responsible for receiving commands from the C&C server and sending responses. It contains an execution loop that starts by reading conﬁguration item #00 to get the C&C address.url the Platinum group strikes again | SecurelistInitializing C&C communication To initialize the connection to the C&C, the payload sends a base64-encoded request that contains a unique SystemID, computer name, and hard disk serial number. After that, the malware starts receiving commands. Receiving commands To receive commands from the C&C, the payload sends an empty request to the C&C. It uses the UserAgent string from the conﬁguration and a special cookie generation algorithm to prepare a request. The malware can also get proxy settings from Internet Explorer.In response to this request, the C&C answers with a PNG ﬁle that contains steganographically hidden data. This data is encrypted with the same key as the C&C requests. The decrypted data contains backdoor commands and arguments for them.Examples of PNG ﬁles:C&C command processor (command descriptions) The backdoor can accept many different commands, with the following among the most interesting:Read any ﬁle from a ﬁle system and send it to the C&C Drop or delete a ﬁle in the ﬁle system Drop a ﬁle and run it Run a command line and send execution results to the C&C Update conﬁguration parameters (except the AES encryption key) Interactive mode – allows to the attacker to receive input from console programs and send their output at the C&CConclusions The Titanium APT has a very complicated inﬁltration scheme. It involves numerous steps and requires good coordination between all of them. In addition, none of the ﬁles in the ﬁle system can be detected as malicious due to the use of encryption and ﬁleless technologies. One other feature that makes detection harder is the mimicking of well-known software.url the Platinum group strikes again | SecurelistRegarding campaign activity, we have not detected any current activity related to the Titanium APT.url
