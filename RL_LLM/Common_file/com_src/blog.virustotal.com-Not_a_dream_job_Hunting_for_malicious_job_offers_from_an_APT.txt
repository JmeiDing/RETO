We found several additional cases in VirusTotal which we believe with high confidence are related to the same activity set.According to the original publication, this activity is most likely related to North Korean actor and could be an extension of Operation “Dream Job”, leveraging targeted distribution of malicious ISO files. Based on Mandiant’s research, in the first stage the attacker sends a job offer at Amazon to the victim by email, followed by a WhatsApp web message where the attacker shares a malicious ISO file, pretending to be part of the selection process.The original publication provides 2 hashes of ISO files named amazon_test.iso and amazon_assessment.iso samples share the same configuration which can be found in an embedded Readme.txt file. The new sample seems to be the new variant with a different configuration, also in a Readme.txt file, as shown below:New sample’s Readme.txt contentBoth ISO files contain two files inside them - a Windows executable (apparently a poisoned version of Putty) and Readme.txt. We decided to search for all the ISO samples bundling only two specific files - Readme.txt and an *.exe file. Additionally, we filtered out all samples over 10Mb or submitted to VirusTotal before 2020. We obtained the AMAZON_ASSESSMEN Volume name (included in the ISO file metadata) can also be used as a pivoting point, as an alternative to the previous query, to find more samples in VirusTotal by clicking on them:Example of ISO metadataWe could use the following query based on metadata that also filters out results based on the previous criteria:metadata:ASSESSMENT tag:isoimage size:10mb- Not only PuTTYAlthough we didn’t deeply analyze the found samples, we spotted two more remote client tools in addition to Putty the volume name (Amazon related) with the ISO name they distributed (SA_Assessment or IT_Assessment).2/4InfrastructureWe extracted all the IP addresses from the Readme.txt files, as well as the contacted hosts during sandbox execution.ISO sha256IP fromReadme.txtIP from 143.244.186[.]68 44.238.74[.]84 44.238.74[.]84Please note these IPs are subject to double checking before adding them to any blocking list. By checking the VirusTotal IP report for any of them, you can find in the “Relations” tab the “Files Referring” section to obtain which files hardcode the IP address, and “Communicating Files” to get which files contacted the IP during sandbox execution:Files with hardcoded 143.244.186[.]68ConclusionsAs a result of this quick research we identified additional samples that seem to be part of the same campaign described by Mandiant, in this case expanding the scheme behind its distribution to, apparently, Dell and IBM in addition to Amazon. Submissions of the identified samples are observed between June and September 2022.In this post we described some ideas we used to identify these samples, but we encourage security researchers to both monitor additional activity and to dig into the newly found samples found to reveal further stage payloads. We3/4created a VirusTotal Collection including the indicators associated with this malicious activity. As always, we are happy to hear any additional ideas to hunt for malicious campaigns.Happy hunting!4/4
