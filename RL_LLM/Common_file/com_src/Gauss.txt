Operating System Statistics Architecture Comparison with Flame Wmiqry32/Wmihlp32.dll aka ShellHW thumbs.db file Gauss C&C Information Gauss C2 Domains Overview: Conclusion2IntroductionWhile analyzing the Flame malware that we detected in May 2012, Kaspersky Lab experts identified some distinguishing features of Flame’s modules. Based on those features, we discovered that in 2009, the first variant of the Stuxnet worm included a module that was created based on the Flame platform. This indicates that there was some form of collaboration between the groups that developed the Flame and Tilded (Stuxnet/Duqu) platforms.Based on the results of a detailed analysis of Flame, we continued to actively search for new, unknown components. A more in-depth analysis conducted in June 2012 resulted in the discovery of a new, previously unknown malware platform that uses a modular structure resembling that of Flame, a similar code base and system for communicating to C&C servers, as well as numerous other similarities to Flame.In our opinion, all of this clearly indicates that the new platform which we discovered and which we called “Gauss,” is another example of a cyber-espionage toolkit based on the Flame platform.Gauss is a project developed in 2011-2012 along the same lines as the Flame project. The malware has been actively distributed in the Middle East for at least the past 10 months. The largest number of Gauss infections has been recorded in Lebanon, in contrast to Flame, which spread primarily in Iran.Functionally, Gauss is designed to collect as much information about infected systems as possible, as well as to steal credentials for various banking systems and social network, email and IM accounts. The Gauss code includes commands to intercept data required to work with several Lebanese banks – for instance, Bank of Beirut, Byblos Bank, and Fransabank.Curiously, several Gauss modules are named after famous mathematicians. The platform includes modules that go by the names “Gauss”, “Lagrange”, “Godel”, “Tailor”, “Kurt” (in an apparent reference to Godel). The Gauss module is responsible for collecting the most critical information, which is why we decided to name the entire toolkit after it.Gauss is a much more widespread threat than Flame. However, we have found no self-replication functionality in the modules that we have seen to date, which leaves open the question of its original attack vector.3Executive SummaryThe first known Gauss infections date back to September-October 2011. During that period, the Gauss authors modified different modules multiple times. They also changed command server addresses. In the middle of July 2012, when we had already discovered Gauss and were studying it, the command servers went offline.Gauss is designed to collect information and send the data collected to its command-and-control servers. Information is collected using various modules, each of which has its own unique functionality:► Injecting its own modules into different browsers in order to intercept user sessions and steal passwords,cookies and browser history.► Collecting information about the computer’s network connections.► Collecting information about processes and folders.► Collecting information about BIOS, CMOS RAM.► Collecting information about local, network and removable drives.► Infecting USB drives with a spy module in order to steal information from other computers.► Installing the custom Palida Narrow font (purpose unknown).► Ensuring the entire toolkit’s loading and operation.► Interacting with the command and control server, sending the information collected to it, downloading additional modules.The spy module that works on USB drives uses an .LNK exploit for the CVE-2010-2568 (url vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-2568) vulnerability. The exploit is similar to the one used in the Stuxnet worm, but it is more effective. The module masks the Trojan’s files on the USB drive without using a driver. It does not infect the system: information is extracted from it using a spy module (32- or 64-bit) and saved on the USB drive.4Infection statsWe began our investigation into Gauss in early June 2012. Based on data obtained through the Kaspersky Security Network, we noticed right away that the Trojan appeared to be widely distributed in three particular countries in the Middle East.Further observation later confirmed this three-country concentration. As of 31 July 2012, we’ve counted around 2500 unique PCs on which files from the Gauss collection have been found.Most infected countriesThe highest number of infections is recorded in Lebanon, with more than 1600 computers affected. The Gauss code (winshell.ocx) contains direct commands to intercept data required to work with Lebanese banks – including the Bank of Beirut, Byblos Bank and Fransabank.In Israel and the Palestinian Territory, 750 incidents have been recorded.Lebanon United Arab Emirates 4Top 10 infected countries5As can be seen in the above table, with the exceptions of the USA and Germany, all incidents took place in the Middle East. However, we believe that in the majority of cases linked to the USA and Germany the affected users were actually in the Middle East too - using VPNs (or the Tor anonymity network).In all, we’ve recorded incidents in 25 countries around the world; however, in all the countries outside the top 10 only one or two incidents have been recorded:Total infected usersRegarding the spreading mechanism used by Gauss, the obtained data leave us with more questions unanswered than solved. The overall number of infections (around 2500) that we’ve detected could in reality just be a small portion of tens of thousands of infections, since our statistics only cover users of Kaspersky Lab products.6When we compare the number of Gauss infections with those of other programs discovered earlier that have either common components or structures, we get the following figures:Name DuquIncidents (KL stats) More than 100 000Incidents (approx.) More than 300 000~ 2500 ~ 700 ~20?~5000-6000~50-60Gauss has been spreading in the region for at least 10 months, in the course of which it has infected thousands of systems. On one hand, this is an uncharacteristically high number for targeted attacks similar to Duqu (it’s possible that such a high number of incidents is due to the presence of a worm in one of the Gauss modules that we still don’t know about). However, the infections have been predominantly within the boundaries of a rather small geographical region. If the malware had the ability to spread indiscriminately – for example, on USB sticks as was the case with Stuxnet – infections would have been detected in much greater numbers in other countries.Operating System StatisticsGauss was designed for 32-bit versions of the Windows operating system. Some of the modules do not work under Windows 7 SP1.OS Windows 7 XP Professional SP2 XP Professional SP3 Windows 7 SP1 Windows 7 Home Vista Home SP1 Vista Home Windows 7 Home SP1 Vista Home SP2 XP Home Edition Vista SP1 Other% from total34.87 1.47There is a separate spy module that operates on USB drives (see description of dskapi.ocx) and is designed to collect information from 64-bit systems.7ArchitectureGauss is a modular system. The number and combination of modules may change from one infected system to another. In the course of our research, we discovered the following modules:Module nameLocationDescriptionCosmos Lagrange%system32%\devwiz.ocx %system32%\dskapi.ocx %system32%\lanhlp32.ocx %system32%\mcdmn.ocx %system32%\smdk.ocx %system32%\windig.ocxCollects information about CMOS, BIOS Infects USB drives with data-stealing module Collects information about network interfaces Collects information about user’s domain Collects information about computer’s drives Installs a custom “Palida Narrow” fontGauss%system32%\winshell.ocxInstalls browser plugins that collect passwords and cookiesShellHW%system32%\wbem\wmiqry32.ocx %system32%\wbem\wmihlp32.ocxMain loader and communication moduleThe configuration of a specific combination of modules for each system is described in a special registry key. This technique, as well as the configuration structure itself, is similar to that used in Stuxnet/Duqu (storing of the configuration in the Windows registry) and Flame (configuration structure). Flame stores its configuration in the main module (mssecmgr.ocx).We created a special detection routine which helped us to discover various Gauss configurations based on registry settings on infected machines. We detected about 1700 such configurations in total, which revealed a picture of modules Kurt (aka Godel) Gauss 1.0.8 Tailor McDomain 1.2 Cosmos LagrangeNumber of PC with the module(defined in config)1655 3You can see three main modules, which are used in most cases – Gauss, Godel and UsbDir.8Some examples of different configs:Cosmos Gauss McDomain 1.2 UsbDirCosmos Gauss 1.0.8 Godel McDomain 1.2 Gauss 1.0.8Godel UsbDirAs mentioned above, we have been unable to discover the original infection vector and the dropper file that installs Gauss in the system. In all the systems we have studied, we dealt with a set of modules that was already installed. It is possible that during initial infection, only the ShellHW component is installed, which then installs the other modules.ShellHW (file name “wmiqry32.dll”/”wmihlp32.dll”) is the main component of the malware which ensures that all other Gauss modules are loaded when the malware starts and operate correctly.9Comparison with FlameAs we mentioned above, there are significant similarities in code and architecture between Gauss and Flame. In fact, it is largely due to these similarities that Gauss was discovered. We created the following table for a clearer understanding of these facts and proof of ‘kinship’ between the two attack platforms:Feature Modular architecture Using kernel drivers .OCX files extensions Using USB as storage Embedded LUA scripting Browser history/cookies stealer CVE2010-2568 (.LNK exploit) C&C communication Log files/stolen data stored in %temp% Zlib compression of collected dataFlame YesPredefined in main bodyStored in registryYes Yes XORYes (hub001.dat)YesYes (soapr32/nteps32)Yes (target.lnk)https XORYes (.thumbs.db)NoYes (winshell) Yes (target.lnk)https Yes YesIn addition to the features listed above, there are considerable similarities in the operation of the Flame and Gauss C&C servers. The relevant analysis is provided in the C&C Communication section.There are more similarities in the code and data of the modules:► C++ runtime type information (RTTI) structures are encoded to hide the names of the standard library classes. The same encoded names can be found in both Flame and Gauss modules, i.e. the first RTTI structure contains name “AVnxsys_uwip” that most likely belongs to the “AVtype_info” class.rpcns4.ocx Flame module: “Flask”winshell.ocx Gauss module: “Gauss”10► Most of Flame and Gauss modules contain dozens of object initialization functions that construct string objectsfrom encrypted data. The layout of these functions is almost identical.mssecmgr.ocxFlame main modulewmiqry32.dll, wmihlp32.dllGauss main module► String decryption routines (“GetDecryptedStrings” used in initialization functions) are very similar, although notidentical, because the layout of the structures holding encrypted strings was changed.mssecmgr.ocxFlame main modulewmiqry32.dll, wmihlp32.dllGauss main module11Wmiqry32/Wmihlp32.dll aka ShellHWInstalled by: Unknown dropperOperates in two modes: installation and normal operation.File namesSome known MD5Image Size Number of resources Resources Date of compilationRelated files%system32%\wbem\wmiqry32.dll %system32%\wbem\wmihlp32.dll 258 048 bytes 7 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181 Jun 1 2011 Jul 16 2011 Jul 18 2011 Sep 28 2011 Oct 20 2011 %temp%\~shw.tmp %temp%\~stm.tmpInstallationThe module checks if it was loaded by “lsass.exe” process and, if true, proceeds with the installation.It writes itself in files: %system32%\wbem\wmiqry32.dll, %system32%\wbem\wmihlp32.dll and modifies the system registry to be loaded instead of %system32%\wbem\wbemsvc.dll file.To achieve this, it writes the following registry value:[HKCR\CLSID\{7C857801-7381-11CF-884D-00AA004B2E24}\InProcServer32] Default = %system32%\wbem\wmihlp32.dllOperationThe module is automatically loaded into processes that use wbemsvc.dll. When loaded in “svchost.exe” that was started with “-k netsvc” parameter, it starts its main thread.The module creates “ShellHWStop”, “Global\ShellHWDetectionEvent” events, mutex “ShellHWDetectionMutex”.12The main thread exits if the following processes were found at its start:LMon.exe zerospywarele.exe13sagui.exe csi-eui.exe dvpapi.exeRDTask.exe spywat~1.exe espwatch.exekpf4gui.exe dltray.exezerospywarelite_installer.exe CV.execlamd.exe VSDesktop.exefgui.exe ipctray.exedlservice.exe avastsvc.exeThe module reads the registry value “SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Reliability” “TimeStampForUI”.

Most of the actions are logged in an encrypted (with XOR) file “%temp%\~shw.tmp”.Sample of decrypted “~shw.tmp”After loading additional modules, it tries to acquire the same privileges as “explorer.exe” and then starts its C&C interaction loop.Prior to communicating with the C&C, all the information from the other modules’ log files is copied to the ~shw.tmp file. Paths to the log files are taken from the TimeStampForUI configuration file. As a result, at this stage ~shw.tmp becomes a universal container file containing all the stolen data.It checks Internet connection (https) by accessing URLs specified in its resource 161.It then checks an https connection with www.google.com or www.update.windows.com. If “200 OK” is received in reply, it sends a request with the proxy server parameters taken from the prefs.js file of the Mozilla Firefox browser.15When an Internet connection is available, it connects to its C&C servers that are specified in resource 131:Connection is established using WinInet API and is performed in two stages:1.

The counter is decremented every time the module fails to connect to its C&C server or to the servers specified in resource 161 and it is reset to the initial value after every successful connection to the C&C server.

When loaded using the LNK vulnerability, they start a main thread and return. The main thread copies the payload to %TEMP% directory and loads itself again. When loaded from %TEMP%, it creates a mutex “Isvp4003ltrEvent”, patches the “NtQueryDirectoryFile” function in ntdll.dll so that it hides its files and then sends the “F5” key event to windows of classes “SysListView32”, “SysTreeView32”, “DirectUIHWND”, causing Explorer directory listings to refresh. This hides the files. It also waits for the event “Global\RasSrvReady”.Then, it retrieves the following data from the system:► Version of the Windows OS► Workstation info► Network adapter information► Routing table► Process list► Environment variables and disk information► List of visible network shares► Network proxy information► List of visible MS SQL servers► URL cacheAll this information is encoded and appended to the file “.thumbs.db” on the infected storage. This file also contains a TTL (time to live) value that is decremented by 1 each time the payload starts from the infected storage. When this counter becomes equal to zero, the payload disinfects the media by removing “.Backup0*” directories and “System32.dat” and “System32.bin” files, leaving “.thumbs.db” file with collected information. Known value of the TTL value is “30.”There are several “special” versions of the payload. They contain additional PE sections with names “.exsdat,” “.exrdat,” and “.exdat”. These sections are encrypted with RC4. The encryption key is derived from an MD5 hash performed 10000 times on a combination of “%PATH%” environment string and name of the directory in %PROGRAMFILES%.The RC4 key is not yet known, neither is the contents of these sections.

The domains “gowin7.com” and “secuurity.net “ have been registered by an “Adolph Dybevek, which is most likely a fake identity:owner-name: Adolph Dybevek owner-address: Prinsen gate 6 owner-city: Oslo admin-address: Prinsen gate 6 ICANN Registrar: UNITED-DOMAINS AG Created: 2012-03-15 Expires: 2013-03-15 Updated: 2012-03-1539As in the case of Flame these domain registration addresses point to existing businesses. For example, at Prinsens Gate 6 in Olso, we find a hotel in Norway:Similarly, many of Flame C&D domain fake registrations used addresses of hotels.During the period of monitoring, we observed these two main domains pointing to two different servers in India and Portugal. Based on passive DNS research, we identified three other servers, located in the US which appear to have been used as C&C.The hosts “gowin7.com” and “secuurity.net” pointed to the following IP addresses:Date2012-06-28 23:05:352012-06-29 07:05:28 (changed)2012-06-28 23:05:382012-06-29 07:05:29 (changed)Domainb.gowin7.com b.gowin7.com b.secuurity.net appeared to be running Debian Linux, which is consistent with the Flame C&C servers. They were listening on ports 22, 80 and 443. The SSL certificates were self-signed, once again, the same as in the case of Flame. Here’s the certificate for the Neugasse 10 Zurich, Zurich 8005 control. It’s quite possible that other samples exist pointing to different hosts.The additional domains ”datajunction.org” and “guest-access.net” can be found in some samples and it is also used for C&C communications. We currently have samples which use “c.datajunction.org” and “d.datajunction.org” but there are probably others using “a.*” and “b.*”.Both have been registered by somebody named “Peter Kulmann,” probably another fake identity:Registrant Name:Peter Kulmann Registrant Street1:Antala Staska 1301/19 Registrant City:Prague Registrant State/Province: Registrant Postal Code:14000 Registrant Country:CZThe address “Antala Staska 1301/19” appears once again to be fake – pointing to a supermarket/pharmacy in Prague:Currently (as of August 2012), all the “*.datajunction.org” hosts point to the C&C server in India. Previously, they pointed to the server in Portugal. Just like the others, they were previously hosted in US.In addition to these, we identified another domain named “dataspotlight.net” which was hosted on the same servers. The registrant is unknown and we couldn’t find any samples using it, however, it is probably related to the others.42Gauss C2 Domains Overview:In total, we have identified 7 domains used or related to the Gauss malware:Domaingowin7.com guest-access.netDomain registration history:Registered by Peter KulmannCurrently hostedPreviously hostedOlder hosted:India USUNKNOWNNoDomainbestcomputeradvisor.com, dotnetadvisor.info datajunction.org. guest-access.net gowin7.com, secuurity.net dataspotlight.netRegistration date22 July 2011 26 July 2011 15 March 2012 18 April 2012As can be seen from the table above, four domains were created in 2011 and were used in older samples.

This is a common technique in the case of massive traffic to a website, suggesting that at their peak, the Gauss C2’s were handling quite a lot of data.Here’s one such example of DNS balancing:;;QUESTION SECTION: ;DATAJUNCTION.ORG.

It was most likely created in mid-2011 and deployed for the first time in August-September 2011.Its geographical distribution is unique; the majority of infections were found in Lebanon, Palestine and Israel. One of the modules from Jan 2012 contains the path “c:\documents and settings\flamer\desktop\gauss_white_1”. The “flamer” in the path above is the Windows username that compiled the project. Given the focus on Lebanon, the “white” version identifier can probably be explained as following: “the name Lebanon comes from the Semitic root LBN, meaning “white”, likely a reference to the snow-capped Mount Lebanon.” (Wikipedia)Code references and encryption subroutines, together with the Command and Control infrastructure make us believe Gauss was created by the same “factory” which produced Flame. This indicates it is most likely a nation-state sponsored operation.Between Gauss’ functions, the “Winshell.ocx” module which gives the name to the malware as “Gauss”, steals credentials required to access online banking accounts for several Lebanese banks – including the Bank of Beirut, Byblos Bank and Fransabank. This is the first publicly known nation-state sponsored banking Trojan.Another feature which makes Gauss unique is its encrypted payload, which we haven’t been able to unlock. The payload is run by infected USB sticks and is designed to surgically target a certain system (or systems) which have a specific program installed. One can only speculate on the purpose of this mysterious payload.The discovery of Gauss indicates that there are probably many other related cyber-espionage malware in operation. The current tensions in the Middle East are just signs of the intensity of these ongoing cyber-war and cyber-espionage campaigns.48
