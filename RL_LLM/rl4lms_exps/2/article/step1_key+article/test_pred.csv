April; a new interesting malware sample; ATMitch; the banking sector; 2017; the,"A new sample of ATM malware ATMitch was discovered in the wild, possibly active since 2017. ATMitch was originally revealed by Kaspersky after compromise of a Russian bank. It is manually installed on ATMs after network compromise. The sample has a custom loader that injects the payload DLL into the fwmain32 process of Wincor ATM software. Once the payload is injected into the ""fwmain"" process, it shows a popup window reporting the outcome of the injection phases. The final steps of an attack involving ATMitch involve connecting to the ATM machine using Remote Desktop, transferring the loader EXE, running it, deleting the initial file to remove tracks, writing commands in the appropriate file, executing new commands, and writing them in the log file. The malware can retrieve info from the ATM and dispense money usingWFSDISPENSE command. The discovery suggests ATMitch is still actively used by sophisticated attackers like Carbanak targeting banks and ATMs. "
the document; a Russian-language document; a malicious executable file; a,"The report details an attack campaign attributed to the China-based threat group BRONZE PRESIDENT, which targeted Russian speakers with updated PlugX malware. In March 2022, researchers analyzed a malicious executable file masquerading as a Russian-language document about a Russian border detachment. The file's name and content suggest it was crafted to target officials familiar with the Russia-China border region. When executed, the file displayed a decoy English-language document about EU sanctions on Belarus while downloading additional files from a staging server. Analysis revealed this to be a typical PlugX attack involving DLL search order hijacking to execute the malware payload. The server also hosted domains linked to previous BRONZE PRESIDENT campaigns using similar techniques. The targeting of Russian speakers and European entities indicates the group has likely received updated intelligence requirements from China due to the war in Ukraine. Rather than its usual Southeast Asian targets, BRONZE PRESIDENT appears to be gathering political and military intelligence of value to China during this period. The report provides indicators of compromise for the malware samples, staging server, and command and control infrastructure. It advises organizations to review access to these to mitigate exposure. The adaptable nature of BRONZE PRESIDENT highlighted means entities in regions of interest to China should closely monitor for similar activity. "
Kasidet; Dridex; Office documents; spear phishing emails; the malware,"Zscaler ThreatLabZ analyzed a malicious Office document campaign delivering both Dridex banking trojan and Kasidet backdoor. The macro inside the Office document downloads the malware payload from URLs hosted on compromised sites. Kasidet installs itself in the appdata folder and uses anti-VM checks to avoid sandboxes. It steals data via memory scraping and browser hooking, sending it to a C2 server. The browser hooking injects code into Firefox, Chrome, and IE to steal sensitive data from these browsers. Network communication uses hardcoded HTTP headers and encrypted C2 commands. Locale checks disable theft from Russian systems. Dridex is also delivered by the same macro document. The shared infrastructure shows criminals reuse delivery mechanisms. Zscaler recommends blocking the identified C2 domains and IOCs listed. The campaign shows blended threats combining banking trojan and backdoor for maximum monetization. "
analysis; McAfee; North Korean malware families; similarities; samples; the Democratic,"The report examines malware campaigns attributed to North Korean state-sponsored threat actors such as Lazarus Group, Silent Chollima, and Group 123. Through code analysis, the researchers found extensive code reuse across many North Korean malware families over time, revealing connections between attacks. The code reuse across campaigns like WannaCry, Mydoom, Dark Hotel, and bank heists indicates North Korea has cyber units with different skills that collaborate when needed. Unit 121 focuses on nationalist aims while Unit 180 focuses on illegal funds. By studying code similarities, the researchers connected many malware families like Brambul, KorDllBot, SierraBravo, NavRAT, and Gold Dragon to the Lazarus Group's operations. Dark Hotel malware also shared code with Troy campaign samples. The timeline shows North Korean cyber activity evolving from 2009 DDoS attacks and wiper malware to recent financially-motivated attacks targeting banks, gambling sites, and cryptocurrencies. The report argues code reuse analysis helps categorize North Korean malware families and groups. It reveals undiscovered links between attacks and allows better attribution by identifying distinctive code markers of North Korean origin. "
the report; a targeted espionage attack; mobile users; the world;,"The document provides a technical analysis of the Pegasus spyware created by NSO Group. Pegasus is a sophisticated mobile attack toolkit that can infect iOS and Android devices. It utilizes three zero-day exploits collectively called Trident to jailbreak devices and install the spyware persistently. The exploits target vulnerabilities in Safari Webkit (CVE-2016-4655), the iOS kernel (CVE-2016-4656, CVE-2016-4657), and a developer tool called jsc. Once installed, Pegasus can exfiltrate messages, calls, emails, logs from apps like Gmail, Facebook, Skype, Telegram, and WhatsApp. It can capture passwords, WiFi credentials, router passwords, GPS location, contacts, and calendar data. The spyware hooks into apps to spy on communications before encryption is applied. Pegasus uses advanced obfuscation, encryption, and stealth techniques to avoid detection. It monitors the device state and can self-destruct if it detects threats to its existence. The software is professionally developed with clean, modular code. The report concludes Pegasus is one of the most sophisticated mobile spyware encountered given its evasion abilities, modules for exfiltrating data, and real-time monitoring/recording of users. Defenders should block associated command and control infrastructure. "
the report; an attack campaign; ProjectM; Indian government; military personnel; the attack;,"The PDF analyzes a cyberespionage campaign called ProjectM that targeted the Indian government and military. ProjectM overlaps with Operation Transparent Tribe and Operation C-Major which also targeted Indian entities. The threat actors rely on spear-phishing emails and watering hole sites to deliver various malware like Crimson, Peppy, DarkComet, and Andromeda. They use blogs with India-related themes as watering holes. Analysis of the threat infrastructure found registration ties to an individual in Pakistan. The same email address was used to register command and control domains as well as legitimate web design domains. Social media accounts of the individual suggest anti-Indian sentiment. His name also appeared in debug symbol paths of Crimson malware samples, suggesting possible involvement in development. The blogs and social media show experience with offensive security tools like Metasploit. The actor also advertised services to bind malware in Excel documents, a technique used by ProjectM. While the extent of the individual's involvement is unclear, the evidence suggests he was likely involved in setting up infrastructure and possibly creation of malware for ProjectM. The report highlights that real people are behind attacks and focusing solely on the technical aspects can cause the human element to be overlooked. "
the report; the ShadowGate campaign; 2015; cryptocurrency miners; the exploit kit;,"The report analyzes the resurgence of a cybercrime campaign called ShadowGate, which is using an upgraded version of its custom exploit kit, Greenflash Sundown, to infect victims worldwide with cryptocurrency mining malware. ShadowGate was active since 2015 but restricted operations after a takedown in 2016. It recently resumed attacks using compromised ad servers to redirect visitors to the Greenflash Sundown exploit kit. Greenflash Sundown has added encryption mechanisms and an evasion technique to collect victim system profiles before delivering payloads, allowing more targeted infections. It continues integrating new exploits like those for recent Flash vulnerabilities. The encryption uses public key cryptography but contains a flaw allowing offline decryption of payloads. The victim profiling helps avoid detection by security sandboxes. Attacks have expanded from primarily Asian targets to global victims across countries like the U.S. The exploit kit drops Monero cryptocurrency miners after infection. The report provides technical analysis of the new exploit kit capabilities and how its operators are refining techniques for evasion, targeting, and delivering payloads.

These tools have keylogging, screenshotting, and data exfiltration capabilities. The group frequently changes infrastructure and tools to evade detection. Once inside a network, BRONZE BUTLER enumerates hosts, escalates privileges, moves laterally, and exfiltrates large amounts of data related to intellectual property, technology, and business operations. The stolen data is often archived and password-protected. The group maintains persistent access to re-enter compromised networks when needed. The report provides strategic and tactical analysis of BRONZE BUTLER's intent, attribution, infrastructure, targeting, malware, tactics, and indicators of compromise. It aims to equip network defenders with insights to detect and respond to this advanced, stealthy threat group. "
Emotet malware; organizations; Security Operation Center; France; the attacker;,"Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF: The PDF describes an analysis of a recent Emotet malware campaign targeting organizations with external Security Operations Centers (SOCs). Emotet is a dangerous banking trojan that steals sensitive data. The attacker sent a phishing email pretending to be an external SOC provider, attaching a document claiming to be a ""SOC Weekly Report"". If opened, the document drops and executes the Emotet trojan. Technical analysis shows the initial document attachment contains heavily obfuscated macros that build objects in memory to avoid writing files. A PowerShell script is extracted that decodes to URLs hosting the Emotet payload. Emotet establishes persistence, gathers system info, and exfiltrates it to command and control servers. It also grabs the external IP address of the infected host. The campaign shows how the Emotet gang is getting more sophisticated, now actively targeting companies with external SOC monitoring to try evading detection. This demonstrates attacker knowledge of the target environment and customizing social engineering for maximum impact. Defenses like updated antivirus, caution around attachments, API monitoring, and network traffic analysis can help detect trojans like Emotet. But human awareness of suspicious emails is still extremely important. In summary, the report analyzes how Emotet malware authors are evolving more advanced socially engineered phishing techniques to infect victims and bypass security monitoring. "
Operation GhostShell; the Middle East; Telecommunications; the US; Russia;,"The PDF discusses Operation GhostShell, a cyberespionage campaign targeting aerospace and telecom firms that has been active since at least 2018. The threat actor is a newly identified Iranian group called MalKamak. The main malware utilized is a remote access trojan (RAT) named ShellClient that has been under continuous development since 2018. ShellClient has evolved from a simple reverse shell to a stealthy, modular RAT incorporating encryption, obfuscation, and command and control via Dropbox to blend in with legitimate traffic. Attacks begin with reconnaissance and malware installation. ShellClient gathers system info and exfiltrates sensitive documents and data to Dropbox accounts controlled by the attackers. Additional tools like credential dumpers, lateral movement utilities, and archiving software facilitate data theft and maintaining persistence. While connections exist to other Iranian groups like Chafer APT and Agrius APT, MalKamak appears to be a distinct threat actor targeting the Middle East and global aerospace/telecom companies specifically. The ongoing development of ShellClient and infrastructure links to Iran point to MalKamak being a cyber espionage unit with likely state sponsorship. Defenders are advised to monitor for the indicators of compromise provided and use the MITRE ATT&CK framework breakdown to check for MalKamak's tactics, techniques, and procedures on their networks. The research aims to bring visibility to this formerly unknown threat. "

The attackers used penetration testing tools to gain initial access to target networks through brute forcing remote desktop protocols. Once inside, they used malicious tools like password stealers and remote access trojans to maintain persistence and steal data. They employed information stealing malware called Gorynych that captured keystrokes and credentials. Gorynych also specifically targeted Bitcoin wallets and downloaded the BlackPOS RAM scraper to steal payment card data from POS systems. The modularity of Gorynych allows adding other capabilities as needed. In addition to Gorynych, the attackers planted various known POS malware like NewPOSThings, Neutrino, and Project Hook. They set up command and control infrastructure and customized malware installers for regional targets. Victims were primarily small and medium sized businesses in retail, manufacturing, and healthcare in the US and Europe. The report provides recommendations on improving security around remote access, passwords, logging, and limiting data. "
the document; a new campaign; the Lyceum Group; the Middle East; the,"The document analyzes a new campaign by the Iran-based threat actor group Lyceum, which targeted Middle Eastern organizations. The initial attack vector was a Word document macro that downloaded and executed a .NET-based DNS backdoor malware. The backdoor is a customized version of an open source DNS tool, modified to leverage DNS hijacking for command and control. It configures a malicious DNS server, generates a bot ID from the victim username, and sends DNS queries containing commands, which the malicious DNS server responds to with data exfiltration. The backdoor's capabilities include downloading additional payloads, uploading files, and executing system commands. It encodes and exfiltrates the command output in DNS requests to the attacker-controlled server. The threat actors spoofed an Iranian military news website to distribute the macro document. The .NET malware shows the group's continued effort to refine tactics like leveraging DNS traffic for stealthy command and control. The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, domain names, and patterns used in crafting malicious DNS queries. It demonstrates how adversaries modify publicly available tools and use standard protocols to avoid detection. "
CredoMap; Russian; APT28/Sofacy/Fancy Bear; Ukraine,"CredoMap is a malware stealer developed by the Russia-based threat actor APT28/Fancy Bear and used to target victims in Ukraine. CredoMap was spread via a document exploiting the Follina vulnerability to download the .NET stealer. The analysis found that CredoMap’s process first obtains the path of the current executable file and then connects to port 143 (IMAP) on the hard-coded C2 server (162.241.216.236). It logs in using hardcoded credentials and reads the server's response. The malware uses IMAP email protocols to exfiltrate stolen data to a command and control server. The malicious binary creates a TcpClient object, gets read and write client streams, and then reads the response from the server. It selects the INBOX folder and performs multiple function calls to steal the browser’s credentials and cookies. It decrypts credentials stored in the browsers using AES-GCM and DPAPI. Extracted credentials and cookies are serialized to JSON and sent to the C2 via IMAP APPEND commands masquerading as emails. Next, the malicious binary opens a connection to the Cookies database and executes a SQL query to extract some fields. It also opens and reads a file named ""Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/Local State"", extracts a Base64-encoded random key from it, and decrypts it using DPAPI. Finally, CredoMap stores the extracted information in a dictionary and exports it to IMAP via JSON serialization. Newly created files will be deleted using the File.Delete method. Indicators of compromise include the C2 IP, spawned cmd processes, and code strings found via reverse engineering. A YARA rule can detect the malware. The use of Follina, stealthy IMAP C2, and encryption shows sophisticated tradecraft by APT28 to stealthily steal and exfiltrate sensitive browser data from targets. "

Mandiant has been tracking FIN7 since 2017, and this report provides an update on their operations through 2021. Key points: FIN7 continues to be active, evolving their tactics, techniques, and procedures over time. Mandiant merged 8 previously separate threat clusters into FIN7 in early 2022 based on extensive analysis of overlaps in infrastructure, code, and tactics. FIN7 heavily leverages PowerShell in intrusions, reusing unique commands across campaigns. They developed a PowerShell backdoor called POWERPLANT which is under active development. FIN7 has diversified initial access techniques, now also using supply chain compromise and stolen credentials in addition to phishing. They often use the POWERPLANT backdoor as first stage malware now rather than LOADOUT/GRIFFON. While not directly attributing ransomware deployment to FIN7, there is evidence like shared infrastructure suggesting FIN7 relationships with various ransomware operations like DARKSIDE over time. FIN7 continues to rapidly modify tools like LOADOUT to evade detections, using obfuscation and packaging malware with things like Bible verses. In addition to core FIN7 activity, Mandiant tracks other clusters suspected to be associated like a ""BadUSB"" campaign distributing DICELOADER and phishing campaigns using BIRDWATCH. Despite 2018 indictments of some members, FIN7 continues to operate, targeting organizations across many industries with intrusions through 2021 and increased speed/scale. "

It highlights how cybercriminals adopted more corporate-style tactics and programs to sustain their operations amid declining ransomware revenue. Major ransomware groups like Conti rebranded themselves to dissociate from negative publicity. They diversified their tools and targets, increasingly moving to Linux and adopting languages like Rust. Gaining initial access remained a priority across different threat actors in 2022. With Microsoft blocking Office macros, attackers shifted to alternatives like HTML smuggling and malvertising for infection vectors. Vulnerabilities in Log4J and old flaws like ProxyLogon were extensively exploited. Attacks increasingly focused on cloud infrastructure, abusing misconfigurations and targeting serverless environments. The attack surface continued expanding while enterprise patching lagged, with a flood of new vulnerabilities disclosed. ZDI reported record advisories, but patch failures and lack of details complicated remediation. Overall threat detections rose 55% year-over-year, with massive spikes in blocked malware files. New ransomware families decreased but LockBit and BlackCat dominated. The report examines the business impact of attacks across industries like manufacturing, government, and technology. It advises robust, adaptive security to address the growing attack surface and sophisticated threats. Key recommendations include asset management, proper cloud security controls, timely patching, and attack surface visibility via centralized monitoring, to identify risks and strengthen defenses. "
Poison Ivy; RAT; PIVY; Asia; the past year,"The cybersecurity company Arbor Networks observed new activity involving the Poison Ivy remote access trojan (RAT) malware targeting several Asian countries over the past year. Technical analysis shows this Poison Ivy variant, nicknamed ""Korplug"", uses DLL sideloading to infect systems. It drops decoy documents hinting at targets, a DLL, and a shellcode file. The malware copies a legitimate Windows executable to load the DLL which decrypts configuration data and connects to command and control servers. Decoy documents suggest targeting of pro-democracy groups in Myanmar around recent elections. Other documents reference ASEAN meetings and members, hinting at targeting of Southeast Asian government and military organizations. Additional decoy documents are written in Korean and Mongolian languages. Infrastructure analysis reveals overlaps between this Poison Ivy activity and other malware families including Gh0strat and Nitol, suggesting possible coordination by a shared threat actor. The malware continues to evolve with new configurations and artifacts likely designed to evade defenses. Arbor Networks assesses that Poison Ivy remains an active threat, with new variants being used in targeted campaigns across Asia by motivated actors. They recommend monitoring systems for related indicators of compromise and ensuring protections against known Poison Ivy malware capabilities. "
the app; the Middle East; the Welcome Chat app; the malware; BadPatch;,"The PDF describes a new cyberespionage operation targeting Android users in the Middle East region. Researchers discovered a spyware app called Welcome Chat being promoted as a secure messaging app, but it actually steals extensive data from victims. Welcome Chat was distributed outside the Google Play store via a website in Arabic. It requests intrusive permissions needed for it to function as a chat app. But it also covertly exfiltrates SMS messages, call logs, contacts, photos, recordings, location, and other data to its command and control server. Analysis indicates Welcome Chat was likely built fully malicious, not by trojanizing a legitimate chat app. Its code was copied from various open source projects. Collected data was found freely available on an unsecured server. Links were found between Welcome Chat and a years-long espionage campaign in the Middle East called BadPatch, tied to the threat actor Molerats/Gaza Hackers. The spyware used the same command and control infrastructure. The report concludes users should avoid sideloading apps from outside official app stores to avoid this type of spyware. Technical details like hashes and ATT&CK techniques are provided to detect Welcome Chat. Users should be wary of chat apps requesting excessive permissions. "
AtomBombing; Windows; atom tables; Async Procedure Calls;,"This PDF document is about a new type of code injection technique called ""AtomBombing"" for Windows systems. The main idea behind this technique is to add shellcode to the global atom table of another process and then use APC (Automatic Procedure Call) to execute it. It works in 3 stages - writing arbitrary data to the target process, executing the code by hijacking a thread, and restoring the thread's execution. The global atom table is used to write shellcode to the target process. APCs invoke ROP chain to allocate RWX memory, copy shellcode, and execute it. The ROP chain pivots the stack to point to the parameters needed for functions like NtAllocateVirtualMemory and memcpy. Shellcode execution is achieved by ret instruction into allocated RWX memory containing shellcode. Original thread execution is restored by using context pointer and ZwContinue after shellcode finishes. "

the document; ESET Research; WHITE; Wslink; virtual machine initialization,"The document analyzes the structure of the virtual machine used to obfuscate malware samples of Wslink, a unique and previously undocumented malicious loader. Wslink's virtual machine uses multiple layers of obfuscation techniques to hinder analysis and detection. The document provides an overview of virtual machine structures in general, including system VMs that support full operating systems, and process VMs that execute individual programs. It describes the bytecode, interpreter, context switching, and dispatch techniques used in process VMs. It then analyzes the specific techniques used in Wslink's VM: The VM is packed with NsPack and contains junk code obfuscation. The VM has two layers - a first VM with around 45 opcodes that executes a second VM with over 1000 opcodes. The second VM initializes itself similarly to common VMs, with context switching from native to virtual registers. The first VM exhibits more complex obfuscation like encrypted operands, opaque predicates, and merged instructions. The document shows how to analyze the VMs using symbolic execution to simplify obfuscated code, concretize known values like internal registers, and reconstruct control flow graphs. Analysis revealed the VM calls Windows API functions to register as a service, zeroes out a status structure, and returns to a VM entry point. The techniques allowed semiautomated deobfuscation of one bytecode block, confirmed against a non-obfuscated sample. Future work could fully process all bytecode blocks to deobfuscate the full malicious code. In summary, the document provides an in-depth analysis of Wslink's advanced obfuscation techniques and demonstrates methods to overcome them. It shows how to peel away layered obfuscation to reveal the underlying malicious payload. "

It shows how social engineering is combined with advanced malware to target high-profile victims and steal sensitive data. "
Trend Micro; a previously unknown malware; watering hole attacks; visitors; the infect,"Security researchers at Trend Micro discovered a new malware campaign using multiple techniques to infect targets and exfiltrate data. The malware has two stages - first a downloader exploit using CVE-2018-8174, followed by the main payload backdoor called SLUB. The downloader checks for antivirus processes, exploits CVE-2015-1701 for privilege escalation, and retrieves the SLUB backdoor. SLUB establishes persistence and uses APIs to communicate with GitHub for commands and Slack for exfiltration. The attackers posted snippets on GitHub with commands starting with ""^"" that SLUB parses and executes, like taking screenshots, listing files, compressing folders, etc. The results are sent to the attacker's Slack workspace in dedicated channels per infected host. Analysis of the commands suggests the attackers are focused on gathering personal communications data from apps like Skype, Twitter, and Korean HWP files. The attacks are precisely executed with minimal infrastructure, suggesting capable threat actors rather than cybercriminals. The attackers created the GitHub and Slack accounts on February 19-20 and began testing the malware February 23-24 before infecting victims starting February 27. Trend Micro notified GitHub and Slack to disable the attacker accounts. Key points are the unique use of GitHub and Slack for the attack, the multi-stage infection process, the commands focused on communications and people data, the speed of the attack execution, and the takedown of the attacker accounts. The malware appears targeted at specific individuals rather than mass spread. "

the report; JPCERT/CC; LuoYu; 2014; Korean; Japanese,"The PDF document describes malware called WinDealer that is used by a threat actor group named LuoYu to target organizations in Korea and Japan since 2014. WinDealer steals information from infected computers and sends it to command and control (C2) servers. When executed, WinDealer reads configuration data from files in C:\ProgramData. It communicates with C2 servers specified in the configuration or random IP addresses if no C2 is configured. It sends an encrypted AES key to the C2, then uses that key to encrypt stolen data before sending it to the C2. WinDealer loads a DLL module from encoded data in its own executable file. This module steals data like files from USB drives, files from folders like Documents and Desktop, keyboard logs, and browser cookies. The stolen data is saved in folders under %TEMP% as .t files, encoded, then consolidated into .a files. WinDealer monitors these .a files, encrypts them, and sends them to the C2. The C2 can send commands to execute processes, delete files, write registry keys for persistence, and more. The report analyses the network communication and data formats used by WinDealer. It also provides indicators of compromise like file hashes and C2 IP addresses. In summary, the report provides a detailed analysis of the WinDealer malware, its configuration, C2 communication, data stealing capabilities, and related IOCs. This provides defenders with insight into the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by the LuoYu group in its cyber espionage operations. "
a group; Billbug; Lotus Blossom; Thrip; at least 2009;,"The cybersecurity company Symantec has uncovered a hacking campaign by a state-sponsored group called Billbug that targeted multiple government agencies and a certificate authority in several Asian countries. Billbug is believed to have been active since at least 2009 and focuses on targets in Asia. In 2019 and 2020, Symantec tracked this group's activity under the name Thrip, but after further investigation, it was determined that Thrip and Billbug were likely the same group. The attackers gained initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications. They then used publicly available dual-use tools like AdFind, WinRAR, and Certutil along with custom malware like the Hannotog and Sagerunex backdoors to compromise victim networks. The backdoors gave the hackers remote access, command execution, and data exfiltration capabilities. While no data theft was observed, espionage is believed to be the motivation given Billbug's history and the nature of the victims. The certificate authority was likely hacked to gain the ability to sign malware with valid certificates to avoid detection. However, there is no evidence this was achieved. Billbug's reuse of known tools and targeting of multiple victims simultaneously demonstrates this is a sophisticated, persistent threat actor that remains undeterred. The campaign has been ongoing since at least March 2022. Protection methods and indicators of compromise are provided. Overall, the report exposes an active espionage operation by a capable state-sponsored group in Asia. "

Duqu 2.0; Kaspersky Lab; the vulnerability; EOP; the attacker; initial,"Here is a summary of the Duqu 2.0 Windows kernel exploit PDF: The Duqu 2.0 malware utilized an advanced exploit targeting a vulnerability in the Windows kernel (Win32k component) to achieve privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution. Discovered by Kaspersky Lab, the exploit shares similarities with the original Duqu malware. The vulnerability arises due to a use-after-free condition triggered when a userland process registers a ClientCopyImage callback which destroys the Window object, while also unregistering the associated class. This leads to a dangling pointer being used by the HMUnlockObject function, allowing corruption of the tagCLS object's cbclsExtra field. By allocating a fake object after the freed memory, the exploit can control the memory layout and contents. Through corrupting the cbclsExtra field to 0xFFFFFFFF, the exploit gains read/write access to kernel memory by using APIs like SetClassLong/GetClassLong with out of bounds indices. It locates the tagWND object and overwrites its strName field to get arbitrary memory read/write. The exploit bypasses SMEP protection by modifying the PTE entry for its shellcode to change the access mode from user to kernel. Shellcode execution is achieved by overwriting the function pointer in the PALETTE object's vtable to point to the shellcode. Calling the GetNearestPaletteIndex method triggers the shellcode. The exploit showcases techniques not commonly observed in prior Win32k exploits. Detection is possible by inspecting tagCLS objects for corruption of the cbclsExtra field. Overall, Duqu 2.0 utilized an intricate Windows kernel exploit as part of its malware toolset. "
the report; Minerva Labs; the CopyKittens; the group;,"The document analyzes the tactics, techniques, and procedures of a threat actor group named CopyKittens that has been conducting cyberattacks in the Middle East since at least 2015. The group uses spearphishing emails with weaponized Office documents to gain initial access. The documents contain malicious scripts that execute a multi-stage malware framework called Matryoshka. The document explains six key points about this attack cycle: 1. Spear Phishing: The first step in the attack cycle involves sending a spear-phishing email to the target user with a malicious PDF attachment. 2. Droppers Matryoshka: The second step involves dropping a Matryoshka dropper onto the target system. This dropper contains a SCR PE file and a reflective loader component. 3. Reflective Loader: The third step involves injecting the reflective loader into the target system's memory. This component allows the malware to run without being detected by antivirus software. 4. RAT Component: The fourth step involves injecting a remote access tool (RAT) component into the target system. This component provides the attacker with full control over the infected machine. 5. Obfuscation Techniques: To evade detection, the attackers use obfuscation techniques such as runtime API address resolution and substitution ciphers to hide the true functionality of the RAT component. 6. Installation and Persistence: The final step involves installing and persisting the malware on the target system. This includes creating registry keys and task schedules to ensure that the malware remains active even after reboots or system crashes. The malware components show evidence of reusing code from open source projects and online forums. The group constantly evolves the malware to evade detection, adding anti-analysis and obfuscation. Known targets include diplomats, government officials, and academic researchers in the Middle East, especially connected to Israel. The exact actors behind the group are unknown but appears to be mid-level operators reusing public code. Their ongoing development of the mature malware framework continues to make them an effective threat in the region. "
the document; a phishing email; Excel; the macro; a phi,"The report by Morphisec Labs analyzes a new phishing campaign dubbed MirrorBlast that is targeting financial organizations. The attack starts with emails containing malicious links that download a weaponized Excel document. The Excel document contains a lightweight macro with anti-sandboxing checks. When enabled, it uses Windows Installer to download an MSI package which deploys either a KiXtart or Rebol script malware. This makes network requests to exfiltrate system data and can download additional payloads. Morphisec assesses with medium to high confidence that MirrorBlast is the work of TA505 based on TTP similarities with things like GetandGo loader, OneDrive lures, and the next-stage FlawedGrace RAT payload. The campaign infrastructure is expanding rapidly as well. The report includes extensive IOCs spanning email attachments, C2 domains/IPs, registry keys, file hashes, and YARA rules. It also provides analysis of the macro, script obfuscation techniques, and C2 communication. In summary, MirrorBlast illustrates the ongoing innovation of advanced cybercriminal groups like TA505. The financial sector remains an attractive target and defenders must adapt to new types of attacks that bypass traditional security controls. "
OSX_DOK; Swiss banking users; a phishing email; a,"Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF: The PDF describes analysis of a new macOS malware called OSX_DOK or OSX_DOK.C by security researchers at Trend Micro. This malware is linked to an ongoing cyberespionage campaign called Operation Emmental which has been active since at least 2014. OSX_DOK is distributed via phishing emails containing malicious .zip and .docx attachments. If opened, it initially shows a fake OSX software update screen to gain admin access. It then installs malicious certficates to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on the victim's internet traffic. The malware specifically targets banking and financial sites in Switzerland. It hijacks connections to these sites, redirecting users to fake login pages controlled by the attackers to steal account credentials and other sensitive data. Researchers discovered OSX_DOK is very similar in behavior to a Windows malware called WERDLOD or Retefe which was also used in Operation Emmental. Both kill browsers, install fake certificates, use tor/proxies, and share the same target list. This suggests OSX_DOK is the macOS version of the same cyberespionage toolkit. Operation Emmental has been active since at least 2014, targeting banks, governments, and corporations in various countries. The addition of macOS malware to their toolkit suggests the attackers are expanding their operations. Trend Micro recommends users be wary of unsolicited email attachments, use comprehensive security software, and enterprise solutions with cross-platform protection to detect threats like OSX_DOK that can steal sensitive data. In summary, the report provides analysis of a new macOS malware linked to an evolving, sophisticated cyberespionage campaign operation for nearly 3 years. "

April 2012; Dell SecureWorks; a cyber espionage campaign;,"The Mirage Campaign is a report by Dell SecureWorks detailing an ongoing cyber espionage operation that uses a remote access trojan (RAT) called Mirage or MirageFox. The campaign has targeted high-profile companies in the energy, oil, and military sectors across the Philippines, Taiwan, Canada, Brazil, Israel, Egypt and Nigeria since April 2012. The primary attack vector is spearphishing emails containing malware that installs Mirage. The emails target mid to senior level executives and pretend to be legitimate attachments like PDFs. Once executed, Mirage copies itself to system folders, creates registry keys for persistence, and phones home to command and control servers for further instructions. It collects system information like MAC address, CPU details, usernames etc. and encodes it before sending. Researchers identified two main variants that differ in their HTTP requests and payloads encoding. Custom versions were found with hardcoded credentials for specific targeted environments. Debugging artifacts point to the malware being developed as 'MirageFox' and kept in a central repository. Sinkholing domains revealed around 100-120 infected hosts across the targeted countries, including an executive level victim at the Philippine oil company. While the attackers use dynamic DNS and hosting in the US to hide their identities, overlaps between IP addresses, domains, and emails point to an actor tracked previously in the HTran and Sin Digoo cases. The campaign shows that only a small number of infections are needed to successfully steal intellectual property and secrets from targeted companies. Recommended defenses include strong perimeter security, intrusion detection, DNS monitoring, and scanning for known indicators of Mirage. "
the Sunburst backdoor; code; similarities; Kazuar; a,"The document analyzes similarities between the Sunburst malware used in the SolarWinds supply chain attack and an older backdoor called Kazuar first reported in 2017. Overlapping code features suggest a potential link between Sunburst and Kazuar. Key similarities include the use of a modified FNV-1a hashing algorithm, a long delays between C2 communications, and a victim ID generation algorithm using MD5 and XOR. While not identical, the shared algorithms indicate similar thought processes in developing the malware. Kazuar has been continuously updated since 2015 and associated with cyberespionage campaigns out of Russia. The latest 2020 Kazuar versions contain code even more similar to Sunburst. The nature of the connection between the two malware families remains unclear - they could originate from the same group, reuse code, have a common source, or it could be an intentional false flag. More research is needed to uncover the relationship between Sunburst and Kazuar. The code overlaps don't definitively tie SolarWinds to Kazuar or the Turla APT group, but provide an initial link for further investigation. The key is encouraging more researchers to analyze the similarity and connections between the two sophisticated malware families. "
Mandiant; a suspected Turla Team operation; UNC4210; a,"Here is a summary of the key points from the Mandiant report on the Turla hacking group's operations in Ukraine: The cybersecurity firm Mandiant discovered in September 2022 that the Russia-linked hacking group Turla was distributing malware to victims in Ukraine by hijacking the infrastructure of an older commodity malware called Andromeda. Andromeda is a widespread malware that spreads via infected USB drives. Turla re-registered several expired Andromeda command and control domains to profile victims and selectively deploy additional payloads. After months of monitoring, Turla used one of the hijacked domains to deploy a reconnaissance tool called Kopiluwak on a compromised Ukrainian system. Kopiluwak profiled the system's network connections, processes, disks, etc. Two days later, Turla deployed a lightweight backdoor called Quietcanary on the same system. Quietcanary was used to collect and exfiltrate documents and data from the victim's machine. Turla appeared to only exfiltrate files created after a certain date, suggesting they were focused on gathering recent strategic information. While Turla has used tools like Kopiluwak before, this campaign shows their effort to gain access in Ukraine since the invasion by hijacking old malware infrastructure. However, some sloppy practices like redeploying Kopiluwak multiple times suggest potential deficiencies in Turla's current operations. Overall, the report highlights how advanced hacking groups like Turla are opportunistically compromising victims in Ukraine by creatively reusing old malware toolsets. "
PDF; F-Secure; a research project; counterfeit Cisco devices; the,"The PDF describes an investigation into counterfeit Cisco Catalyst networking devices. The key points are: - Two counterfeit Cisco Catalyst 2960-X switches were obtained for analysis after failing following a software upgrade. The goal was to check for any malicious modifications and understand how they bypassed authentication. - Visual differences in text and component quality were noticed compared to a genuine device. The counterfeit devices lacked a holographic sticker and showed signs of PCB modifications. - Boot process analysis revealed the counterfeits spoofed platform authentication checks, but no persistent backdoors were found in software. - Hardware analysis uncovered the modifications: - Counterfeit A added a circuit board using the I2C bus to exploit a race condition in the SLIMpro boot ROM, bypassing its signature checks. - Counterfeit B replaced the EEPROM with an encrypted chip, comprehensively preventing further analysis. - The SLIMpro bug allowed bypassing the secure boot process, but no backdoors were introduced into its software. - Keys for verifying Cisco software signatures were located in the firmware, allowing validation of this conclusion. In summary, the counterfeits used hardware modifications to bypass authentication checks during boot, but did not appear to introduce persistent software backdoors. The bug exploited represents a previously unknown vulnerability. "
Zscaler; a malicious lure document; the document; the attackers; the document,"The document analyzes a targeted attack campaign that leveraged the India-China border dispute as a lure. The attack starts with a malicious Word document sent via email that appears to contain an article about the border tensions. The document contains a macro that executes a PowerShell command to run embedded shellcode. The shellcode is fileless and does not write anything to disk. It downloads a second stage shellcode pretending to be from a Microsoft domain using a fake HTTP host header. The second shellcode contains a Cobalt Strike beacon payload encrypted with a GIF header. The shellcode decrypts this payload and executes it. The beacon uses Domain Generated Algorithm (DGA) domain C2 servers and steganography to blend in. The attackers used the DKMC malware framework along with Cobalt Strike. While attribution is unclear, OceanLotus and TrickBot groups have used similar techniques. The campaign shows how adversaries leverage current geopolitical events as lures and evade detection via living off the land tools, fake headers, encryption, and proxy comms. In summary, this was a sophisticated, targeted attack abusing the India-China dispute to trick victims into downloading modular, fileless malware designed to evade detection while enabling the attackers to control compromised systems. "

Android APT spyware; Middle East victims; the app; apps; the user; SMS text,"The document describes newly discovered variants of an Android spyware called Andr/Spy-BFI. This spyware has previously been attributed to an advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as C-23 or FrozenCell that targets individuals in the Middle East. The new variants appear as apps named ""App Updates"", ""System Apps Updates"", or ""Android Update Intelligence"". They likely spread via SMS links and have not been hosted on the Google Play store. The spyware requests extensive permissions from users under false pretenses, including notification access to read messages/contacts, device admin privileges, and usage tracking. After permissions are granted, it disguises itself as a legitimate app like Chrome to avoid manual removal. The malware exfiltrates extensive data from the device including messages, contacts, audio recordings, screenshots, camera images, and logs of app usage. It communicates with command and control servers posing as Laravel web frameworks. New capabilities in these variants include modifying the C2 domain if others are taken down, using signed certificates associated with past malware, and changing icon/name for stealth. The core spyware functionality of stealing data and communicating with C2 remains the same. Sophos recommends only installing apps from trusted sources, being wary of sensitive permission requests, and using mobile antivirus to detect such threats. Technical details and indicators of compromise are provided for defenders. In summary, these are enhanced variants of the Andr/Spy-BFI Android spyware used by the C-23 APT group and targeting Middle Eastern victims with more evasive capabilities. "
PDF; FireEye; Threat Actors; Public Exposure; a major,"This presentation examines how threat actors respond when their operations are publicly exposed through white papers or blogs. It finds that public reporting often triggers changes in the threat actors' tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) as they seek to evade detection and continue operations. The presentation analyzes case studies of various groups, including nation-state actors like APT28 and APT17, and financially-motivated actors like FIN4. It finds that the threat actors are usually aware of public reporting about their activities, and exposure can disrupt operations, especially for financial groups. However, espionage groups often continue unfazed. When operations are exposed, threat actors frequently retool by abandoning compromised tools, developing new ones, and shifting tactics. But they tend to stick with the easiest path forward. Well-resourced groups may solve problems by adding more time, money and tool development. The presentation notes that exposure provides benefits but security researchers must weigh these against potential loss of visibility into the threat actors. They should consider the intended impact, consequences, actor's adaptability, targeting determination, and likely TTP shifts. In summary, the presentation provides an insightful examination of how different types of threat actors respond when their operations are publicly exposed. It highlights the need for security researchers to carefully evaluate the tradeoffs around reporting. "
Dell SecureWorks; Duqu; a malware threat; the infamous Stuxnet,"Here is a summary of the Duqu Trojan Questions and Answers PDF: The PDF provides an overview and analysis of the Duqu trojan malware threat discovered in 2011. Duqu is composed of a Windows kernel driver that loads encrypted DLLs implementing a remote access trojan (RAT) payload. An additional information stealing module logs keystrokes and system data. While there are some similarities between Duqu's kernel driver injection techniques and those used in Stuxnet, analysis shows the ultimate payloads are very different. The evidence is insufficient to definitively prove Duqu and Stuxnet come from the same source. Duqu does not target industrial control systems like Stuxnet. Duqu's main purpose is to provide an attacker with remote access and the ability to run arbitrary code on a victim system. No specific targets are evident in the code. Indicators of infection include network connections to Duqu command and control servers, DNS lookups for Duqu domains, presence of files named ""~DQ"", and non-SSL traffic over port 443. Protection measures include monitoring network connections and egress traffic, detecting Duqu-related files, and using antivirus, antimalware and host-based security controls. However, Duqu variants can bypass antivirus detection. holistic security encompassing network controls and monitoring, segmentation, access controls and policies is recommended. In summary, Duqu is a remote access trojan exhibiting some technical similarities to Stuxnet but lacking specifics linking it to ICS attacks. It provides flexible malware capabilities allowing an attacker to control compromised systems. Ongoing monitoring, network security controls, and host protections can help mitigate the threat. "
the report; a malicious campaign; the Bitter APT group; Bangladeshi government entities,"The blog post details a spear-phishing campaign targeted at Bangladesh government organizations that Cisco Talos researchers attribute to the Bitter APT group with moderate confidence. Bitter has previously targeted South Asian government entities but this campaign signals an expansion into Bangladesh. The spear-phishing emails contain either a malicious RTF document or Excel spreadsheet as an attachment. When opened, these documents exploit known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office to download and install a new Bitter trojan called ZxxZ. ZxxZ gathers system info and can download and execute additional files sent from the command and control server. The infrastructure analysis shows similarities between this campaign's C2 and previous Bitter campaigns. The phishing emails originate from and spoof legitimate Pakistani government organizations. The emails contain thematic lures relevant to the target organization's work. Bitter is mainly motivated by espionage and known to exploit vulnerabilities in victims' environments. They are known to target both mobile and desktop platforms and their arsenal mainly contains Bitter RAT, Artra downloader, SlideRAT and AndroRAT. The actor's infrastructure consists of the C2 server (helpdesk[.]autodefragapp[.]com) and several domains that host the adversary's malware. The post analyzes the infection chain, documents, malware, and C2 communication in detail. It covers detections, protections, and IOCs available to defend against this threat. The researchers conclude organizations should implement layered security and be vigilant about targeted attacks in their region from motivated adversaries like Bitter. "

It provides extensive technical analysis of how the malware infection occurs through a JavaScript exploit in Internet Explorer 6, drops malicious files on the system, and installs a backdoor trojan payload. The backdoor communicates over HTTPS to command servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data. The malware uses multiple stages and encryption to hide its activity. File names and service names are randomized. The report covers in depth how to detect the malware through memory forensics, network monitoring, and other means. Though malware code patterns indicate Chinese origin, there is no definitive proof the Chinese government was behind the attacks. Likely it was a skilled independent hacking group. Aurora shows the capabilities of advanced malware operations even several years ago. Recommendations are made for security products to detect, analyze, and respond to infections. "
the Bisonal backdoor; APT; Karma Panda; Tonto Team; financial and,"The document is a report by cybersecurity company Kaspersky detailing the activities of an advanced persistent threat (APT) hacking group called CactusPete, also known as Karma Panda or Tonto Team. CactusPete is a Chinese-speaking group that has been active since at least 2013, targeting organizations in Asia and Eastern Europe, especially those in the military, diplomatic, infrastructure, and technology sectors. In February 2020, Kaspersky observed a new campaign by CactusPete using an updated version of their custom malware called Bisonal. The targets were financial and military organizations in Eastern Europe. The updated Bisonal backdoor version maintains functionality similar to past backdoors built from the same codebase. Analysis of the malware revealed it has information stealing capabilities and is controlled via a hardcoded command and control server address. The malware exfiltrates extensive details about the infected system to the C2. CactusPete typically infects victims via spear phishing emails containing malicious document attachments that exploit vulnerabilities to install malware if opened. Kaspersky suggests network monitoring, keeping software updated, using antivirus, and employee awareness training to defend against such threats. The report also provides an overview of CactusPete's activities since 2013, showing continued campaigns distributing various backdoors like Bisonal, DoubleT, and ShadowPad. Their targets have expanded but remain focused on Asia and Eastern Europe. Though CactusPete does not use highly advanced malware, their success relies on crafting convincing phishing emails to reliably compromise targets of interest. Kaspersky suggests companies need to train employees more effectively against such phishing. "
Volexity; activity; January 2021; two customers; Microsoft Exchange servers; the attacker,"The PDF discusses active exploitation of multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange servers that began in early January 2021. Attackers were using a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability (CVE-2021-26855) to steal emails without authentication and a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2021-27065) to install web shells and move laterally. The SSRF vulnerability allows attackers to send crafted requests to download emails from targeted mailboxes without any authentication needed other than knowing the email address. Chaining this with the RCE vulnerability allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on Exchange servers to install ASPX web shells, dump credentials, add user accounts, and steal AD databases. Volexity observed these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild starting January 6, 2021. The attacks appear targeted for cyber espionage, conducted by multiple groups using varied tools for post-exploitation activities.

the document; a state-sponsored campaign; Russian critical infrastructure; the actor; phi,"The PDF details research conducted by security company Cylance into a three-year hacking campaign targeting Russian critical infrastructure. Cylance initially believed this was a nation-state sponsored attack, but further investigation revealed it was likely criminally motivated. - Cylance uncovered phishing documents containing malware targeting Russian oil and gas companies, primarily Rosneft. The documents used macros to download malware. - The malware was a backdoor called RedControle that could capture screenshots, keystrokes, etc. It communicated with infrastructure mimicking real Russian companies. - In addition to Rosneft, the attacker mimicked over two dozen mostly state-owned Russian companies in oil, gas, agriculture, chemicals, etc. They used lookalike domains for command and control. - The malware evolved from initially targeting the gaming community to more lucrative targets in Russian critical infrastructure. - Open source intelligence connected the malware to past criminal campaigns targeting gamers. - The attacker relied on cheap VPS services, putting in considerable effort to mimic legitimate companies for credential harvesting and fraud. - Cylance believes this was a criminal operation rather than state-sponsored espionage, despite the targets. Criminals can exploit inherent biases that sophisticated attacks on critical infrastructure appear to be nation-state activity. "
Avast Threat Intelligence Team; a remote access tool; RAT; the,"Avast Threat Intelligence discovered a remote access trojan (RAT) being used in active attacks in the Philippines. The RAT uses an expired digital certificate belonging to the Philippine Navy that appears to have been compromised. The certificate was valid from December 15, 2019 to December 15, 2020. Avast believes the threat actors likely had access to the private key. The RAT was seen using this certificate still in June 2020 after it had expired. The RAT connects to a command and control server at dost[.]igov-service[.]net over port 8443 using TLS. The certificate is pinned so only this specific certificate can be used. Analysis of the malware shows the compilation timestamp was modified to show 2004, but the version of OpenSSL used was from April 2020. The developer username found was likely ""udste."" The RAT has capabilities like executing shellcode, reading/writing files, deleting files, and listing drives and directories. The commands are encrypted except for a hard-coded mutex string meant to mimic the Quasar RAT. Avast notified CERT-PH and the Philippine Navy. The navy stated the incident was resolved and no further help was needed. Avast customers are protected from this threat. The key points are that a valid Philippine Navy certificate was compromised and abused to sign malware, the RAT has several malicious capabilities, and Avast worked with Philippine authorities to disclose the findings.

the document; Trend Micro; South Korea; the Andariel Group; Lazarus Group,"The document analyzes new reconnaissance tactics by the Andariel group, a branch of the Lazarus cybercrime group, used to target entities in South Korea. Andariel has compromised South Korean websites by injecting scripts that collect information on visitors' browsers including plugins, software versions, and ActiveX objects. This recon is likely preparation for watering hole attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in collected targets. Analysis shows Andariel has expanded its targeting from just ActiveX objects to also detect local websockets, indicating they may be expanding beyond ActiveX exploits. Newly monitored ActiveX objects point to digital rights management and voice conversion software used by South Korean institutions. Andariel has previously conducted similar recon before deploying an ActiveX zero-day in 2017. Their obfuscation techniques and code similarities connect this new activity to the group. Researchers have notified affected websites and published indicators of compromise including script hashes, command and control URLs, and listener ports. Andariel's recon provides insight into their plans and likely next targets. Recommendations include using layered security solutions and machine learning to detect related malware and block associated URLs. "
"CRASHOVERRIDE; the threat; electric grid operations; Ukraine; December 17, 2016","The whitepaper provides an analysis of the CrashOverride malware framework used in the December 2016 cyberattack that caused a blackout in Ukraine. CrashOverride is modular malware tailored for attacking electric grid operations. Its components include an initial backdoor, a launcher, payloads, and a wiper module. The backdoor provides access to infected hosts. The launcher loads ICS-specific payload modules that manipulate grid operations. The wiper disrupts systems after payloads execute. The payload modules implement grid communications protocols like IEC 104, IEC 61850, and OPC DA to interact with grid devices. This allows CrashOverride to monitor, send unauthorized commands, and spoof normal operations. It can open breakers to de-energize substations and manipulate protective relays. CrashOverride evolves previous ICS malware tradecraft by codifying knowledge of grid operations into reusable modules. It can be adapted to target facilities in Europe and some parts of the Middle East and Asia. Expanding protocol support would allow broader targeting. While CrashOverride cannot cause widespread grid failure, coordinated attacks could result in regional outages over multiple days. However, grid defenses like human monitoring and redundancy provide resilience against such attacks. Recommended mitigations include monitoring for protocol anomalies, robust backups, and incident response planning. In summary, the whitepaper provides a technical analysis of the CrashOverride malware's modular framework, grid-specific payloads, and potential to cause disruptive attacks against electric utilities.

the SessionManager; IIS; use; organizations; Africa; South America; Asia,"The document discusses a malicious IIS module called SessionManager that has been used to backdoor Microsoft Exchange servers after they were compromised via ProxyLogon vulnerabilities. SessionManager acts as a persistent and stealthy backdoor, allowing attackers to control compromised servers. The backdoor offers several capabilities that make it a lightweight persistent initial access backdoor, including reading, writing to, and deleting arbitrary files on the compromised server, executing arbitrary binaries from the compromised server, establishing connections to arbitrary network endpoints that can be reached by the compromised server, and reading and writing in such connections. SessionManager was developed in C++ and has evolved through several versions since March 2021. It intercepts HTTP requests to run commands, read/write files, execute processes, and make network connections back to its operators. The module has targeted government, military, NGOs, and companies primarily across Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. It is suspected to be operated by the threat actor group Gelsemium, who has links to espionage activities. SessionManager abuses normal HTTP cookie values to pass commands and exfiltrate data. Later versions encrypt this traffic. After deploying it, attackers have used SessionManager to download additional reconnaissance and credential theft tools. Commands are passed from an operator to SessionManager using a specific HTTP cookie name. The answer from the backdoor to an operator will usually be inserted in the body of the server HTTP response. The report details the IOCs of SessionManager and related tools, as well as recommendations for detecting and removing IIS module backdoors. It highlights that Exchange servers compromised since early 2021 require thorough investigation for stealthy threats like SessionManager. Overall, the report sheds light on an overlooked but dangerous IIS backdoor being used for long-term access to violate organizations globally. It serves as a reminder that major vulnerabilities like ProxyLogon have lingering consequences that may take months or years to fully uncover. "

March; Gamaredon; APT; 2013; Ukrainian government institutions; emails; the group,"The PDF describes campaigns by the Gamaredon APT group, an active threat group since 2013 that typically targets Ukrainian government institutions. Gamaredon has been using COVID-19 themed phishing emails with malicious document attachments in recent campaigns targeting victims in Europe and elsewhere. The infection chain involves a docx file attachment that uses a template injection technique to download a malicious dot template file containing macros. The macros execute a VBScript that decrypts and downloads additional payloads. The campaigns follow typical Gamaredon tactics like using socially relevant lures and targeting government entities, but have added some new technical aspects like obfuscating the VBScript payload. The analysis uncovers infrastructure links between the campaigns, like common IP addresses of Russian hosting providers. Several malicious files, URLs, and IoCs are provided. The campaigns show how threat actors like Gamaredon are opportunistically using the pandemic in social engineering while continuing to refine their technical malware delivery tactics. Recommended mitigations for these kinds of cyber attacks are provided. "
the report; Kaspersky Lab; a series; attacks; unknown malware; early 2017,"Kaspersky Lab has been tracking a series of cyberespionage attacks targeting high-profile organizations around the world since early 2017. The attacks appear to be geopolitically motivated. The main targets are government entities in the Middle East and North Africa, especially Palestine, including parliaments, senates, top state offices, military agencies, ministries, and more. Other regions have also been hit. The attackers use spearphishing to distribute malware that provides a remote command shell for stealing data. Decoy documents are tailored to the targets. Over 100 victims have been identified across the Palestinian Territories, Egypt, Jordan, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and many other countries including the US, UK, Russia, and more. Attribution is difficult due to the use of false flags, but the targeting points to a sophisticated threat actor with access to an elaborate database of high-value targets worldwide.

The report advises high-profile targets to implement elevated cybersecurity measures like threat intelligence, endpoint detection and response, and air-gapped networks. "
PwC UK; BAE Systems; a new cyber espionage campaign,"The document analyzes the activities of a China-based cyberespionage group called Cloud Atlas or APT10. It examines two major campaigns conducted by APT10 in 2016-2017 - one targeting managed IT service providers (MSPs) globally, and one targeting organizations in Japan. The MSP campaign, dubbed Operation Cloud Hopper, allowed APT10 unprecedented potential access to MSP clients globally. By compromising MSPs, APT10 gained access to client networks to exfiltrate intellectual property and sensitive data undetected. The report details APT10's tactics, techniques and procedures, which have evolved since previous public exposure in 2013 led them to retool. These include use of dynamic DNS infrastructure, new custom malware like RedLeaves, and open source tools like QuasarRAT. Other key findings are that APT10's activities align with Chinese working hours and strategic priorities outlined in China's 5 year plans. The group's targeting of aviation, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, managed services, etc. provides economic and competitive intelligence beneficial to Chinese interests. The level of access and data theft seen indicates APT10 has extensive resources and highly skilled operators. The report aims to uncover their latest campaigns, assess the threat they pose, and provide mitigation advice to potential targets. "
the Russian Federation; a ransomware; CryWiper; the malware;,"The PDF describes a new data-destroying Trojan called CryWiper that was detected attacking an organization's network in Russia in Fall 2022. CryWiper pretends to be ransomware by leaving a ransom note demanding payment in bitcoin to decrypt files. However, analysis shows CryWiper does not actually encrypt files, but rather irreversibly overwrites them with pseudo-random data generated using the Mersenne Twister algorithm. CryWiper is a 64-bit Windows executable likely developed using MinGW on Linux. After starting via Task Scheduler, it contacts a command and control server to get the command 'run' which triggers destruction. It stops critical processes like databases and email servers to access occupied files. CryWiper skips files in certain directories like Windows and Trend Micro, but destroys documents, media, source code etc. The ransom note uses typical ransomware messaging, providing a BTC wallet, email contact, and fixed victim ID. But since the data is destroyed, the ID serves no purpose. The email address used was also found in past ransomware samples, suggesting possible code reuse. While CryWiper is a new family, the use of Mersenne Twister PRNG links it to IsaacWiper which targeted Ukraine. The code destruction approach shows the intent is disruption, not financial gain. The number of such wiper attacks is increasing amid geopolitical tensions. Protection requires behavioral detection, endpoint security, email scanning, penetration testing, threat monitoring, and threat intelligence. "
the document; VMware Threat Analysis Unit; TAU; ShadowPad; 2015; the command;,"The document describes research by VMware's Threat Analysis Unit on the command and control (C2) protocol used by the ShadowPad malware. ShadowPad is a modular malware platform used by China-linked threat actors since 2015. ShadowPad supports six C2 protocols: TCP, SSL, HTTP, HTTPS, UDP, and DNS. The analysis focuses on the TCP, HTTP(S), and UDP C2 protocols. It provides details on the packet header formats, encoding algorithms, and initial handshake flows for these protocols. Multiple ShadowPad variants were analyzed that use different encoding values. Based on the protocol analysis, VMware implemented scanners to actively search for ShadowPad C2 servers on the internet. Between 2021-2022, they identified 83 servers linked to 3 variants. The number of active C2s declined in 2022. Samples communicating with discovered C2 IPs included malware like Spyder and ReverseWindow used by China-linked groups. One Spyder sample was found to have code similarities to Winnti malware, suggesting it could be a lightweight version. In summary, the report documents VMware's in-depth analysis of ShadowPad's C2 protocols, implementation of detection scanners, discoveries of 83 C2 servers over time, and connections to advanced malware samples. This showcases the value of C2 protocol analysis and active scanning for proactive discovery of threats. "
the document; Threat Analysis Group; TAG; a financially motivated threat actor; EX,"Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has been tracking a financially motivated threat actor named EXOTIC LILY that exploits vulnerabilities and works as an initial access broker. EXOTIC LILY appears linked to the ransomware groups Conti and Diavol, and the cybercrime group WIZARD SPIDER/FIN12. At its peak, EXOTIC LILY was sending 5,000 phishing emails a day to 650 organizations. EXOTIC LILY uses social media profiles and email spoofing to send spear phishing emails under the guise of business proposals, such as outsourcing software development projects or information security services. The attackers would schedule meetings with their targets to discuss project design or requirements, and then upload payloads to public file-sharing services using built-in email notification features. This makes it challenging for detection systems to identify the attacker's email address. Human-operated phishing at scale is a common tactic used by EXOTIC LILY operators, who customize initial proposal templates, handle further communications with targets, and upload malware from other groups to file-sharing services before sharing it with the target. EXOTIC LILY has switched from delivering documents containing an exploit for CVE-2021-40444 to delivering ISO files with hidden BazarLoader DLLs and LNK shortcuts. These samples have indicators that suggest they were custom-built for the group. While EXOTIC LILY operates independently, focusing on acquiring initial access through email campaigns, it collaborates with other actors to deploy Conti and Diavol ransomware. Google is improving user protection by adding additional warnings for emails originating from website contact forms, better identification of spoofing, and adjusting the reputation of email file sharing notifications.

the attack; APT; Wekby; US; recent weeks; the malware; HTTP,"The document describes a new malware campaign by the APT group Wekby targeting a US organization. Wekby has been active for years targeting healthcare, telecoms, aerospace, defense, and tech sectors. The malware used has ties to the HTTPBrowser family and uses DNS requests for command and control. Palo Alto Networks has named this malware pisloader. The initial dropper sets persistence in the registry Run key and drops/executes the pisloader payload. The payload uses heavy obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques including return-oriented programming and garbage code insertion. Pisloader sends DNS requests with random alphanumeric subdomains to resolve TXT records that contain base32-encoded commands. It sends periodic beacons and supports commands like system info collection, file listing, upload, and command shell. The C2 server is hardcoded as ns1.logitech-usa[.]com. Pisloader is likely a variant of HTTPBrowser due to metadata, supported commands, and formatted command responses. New domains were registered for this campaign like globalprint-us[.]com hosting the droppers. Other Poison Ivy and pisloader samples were hosted on these domains. Palo Alto Networks has detection mechanisms including WildFire classification, AutoFocus tags, malicious IP/domain blocking, and IPS rules to detect pisloader. The Wekby group continues to use sophisticated techniques like DNS for C2, return-oriented programming, and anti-analysis measures. Pisloader allows them to bypass certain security products incorrectly inspecting DNS traffic. "

Threat intelligence reveals links between the Windows malware and two new Android malware families called SECUREUPDATE and VAMP. They use similar infrastructure and targeting. In summary, the report provides extensive technical details on the KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA malware families used in targeted attacks in the Middle East. It explores the distribution methods, capabilities, infrastructure, and potential targets of the malware campaign. "
Secureworks; attacks; Iranian; COBALT MIRAGE; at least June 2020;,"The report details intrusion activity by the Iranian threat group COBALT MIRAGE against organizations in the US and other countries. Researchers have identified two clusters of activity - one focused on opportunistic ransomware attacks for financial gain, the other on targeted intrusions for intelligence collection. Initial access is gained via exploits of vulnerabilities like ProxyShell on Exchange servers. Custom malware like the dllhost.exe binary is used to maintain access, exfiltrate data, and deploy ransomware tools like BitLocker. The threat actors move laterally using RDP and scripts, collecting credentials and scanning the environment. Ransomware attacks involve leaving printed ransom notes with email contacts, suggesting a manual victim coordination process. The targeted intrusions involve more hands-on activity inside networks and experimentation with ransomware. The blurred lines between financial and espionage motives makes COBALT MIRAGE an unpredictable threat. After disrupting their access, the threat actors have repeatedly regained access to environments using the same techniques. Their limited post-exploit capabilities suggest their access could be leveraged further given the weaknesses being exploited. Continued patching, multi-factor authentication, and monitoring for associated TTPs is advised. The report provides technical analysis of the group's custom tools, infrastructure, and techniques. It includes indicators of compromise to detect activity, though care should be taken before visiting potentially malicious sites. The adaptability of COBALT MIRAGE means organizations should closely monitor for similar activity that could indicate they are targeted. "
the use; crypters; use; Trickbot; BazarLoader;,"The cybercriminal group ITG23, which operates malware like Trickbot and BazarLoader, has developed at least 13 different crypters to encrypt and obfuscate malware payloads. These crypters have names like Dave, Pear, Lore, Mirror, and Hexa. ITG23 uses the crypters to protect its own malware like Trickbot, BazarLoader, and Conti ransomware. But it also provides crypting services to other threat actor groups. ITG23 has long-standing relationships with the groups behind Emotet and IcedID banking trojans, and uses its crypters on their malware. In mid-2021, ITG23 set up an automated ""Build Machine"" using the Jenkins platform to scale up their crypting operations. The Build Machine can compile customized stub executables to embed encrypted payloads from various malware families. Analysis of ITG23's crypters reveals the use of obfuscation, polymorphism, anti-debugging, and other techniques to evade security products and analysis. Payloads are encrypted in ways that reduce detectable entropy. Most crypters execute the final payload in-memory after decryption. Leaked ITG23 chat logs provide further insight into their partnerships with groups like Emotet and IcedID. ITG23 also began providing crypting services to the Qakbot banking trojan in late 2021. Links between IcedID and the MountLocker ransomware operation suggest IcedID may be behind MountLocker. Defending against ITG23 requires updated threat intelligence on their latest crypters, malware, and attack tactics. Controls around email, endpoints, access, network segmentation, monitoring, and data protection are necessary to mitigate the risk. "

analysis; Digital Quartermasters; Asia; APT groups; Chinese; Indian; APT,"The document analyzes overlaps in tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) between Chinese and Indian advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. Specifically, it examines similarities in weaponized RTF phishing files used by several Chinese APTs (Goblin Panda, Temp.Periscope, Temp.Trident) and one Indian APT (Sidewinder). Analysis identified shared object dimensions and obfuscation methods in the RTF files of these groups, indicating use of a common phishing kit and potentially a shared supply chain. However, the groups diverge in post-exploitation stages. Sidewinder downloads payloads via HTAs while the Chinese APTs use shellcode and source files. This points to separate operators tailoring the tools after initial acquisition. The timeline shows the Chinese groups leveraging the phishing kit first, with Sidewinder adopting it months later. This raises the possibility of Chinese-Indian APT overlap in exploit trading, though the origin of the kit is undetermined. The report concludes that more research is needed on supply chain relationships between advanced threat groups in Asia. Defenders should monitor for shifts in TTPs that may indicate APTs acquiring new shared tools and exploits."

TA558 sends phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links to victims, typically hotels, travel agencies, and other tourism-related businesses. The emails use reservation and booking themes as lures. If victims open attachments or click links, TA558 installs remote access trojans like Loda RAT or Revenge RAT on their systems. TA558 mainly targets organizations in Latin America and Spanish/Portuguese speakers, but has expanded to Western Europe and North America over time. The group was most active in 2020, but increased attacks again in 2022. In 2022, TA558 shifted away from macro documents to using ISO and RAR files likely to bypass new Microsoft macro restrictions. The remote access trojans installed by TA558 can be used to steal sensitive customer and corporate data. They also allow lateral movement and deployment of additional malware. The group has used at least 15 different malware families over time. TA558 customizes attacks for each target, but repeatedly uses the string ""CDT"" in its infrastructure, possibly referring to a travel company. The group poses an ongoing threat to travel and hospitality entities globally, especially in Latin America. In summary, the document provides an overview of TA558 campaigns, tactics, infrastructure, targeting, and objectives as a financially-motivated actor that has consistently targeted the travel industry since 2018.

the report; ThreatConnect; a KASPERAGENT malware campaign; decoy,"The PDF describes the discovery of a new malware campaign in April-May 2017 that uses KASPERAGENT malware. KASPERAGENT is a type of malware that has been used in targeted attacks in the Middle East since 2015. It was originally discovered and named by security researchers in April 2017. The new campaign uses KASPERAGENT variants that have some similarities to previous versions, including the use of the ""OPAERA"" user agent string. However, this campaign uses different command and control infrastructure, including the domain windowsnewupdates[.]com. The malware samples are distributed via documents that appear to be official Palestinian Authority correspondence and reference recent political events in Gaza. The documents are addressed to leaders of Hamas and discuss topics like the assassination of a Hamas military commander and the banning of the rival Fatah party. The command and control IP address hosting windowsnewupdates[.]com has also hosted other domains registered to individuals in Gaza. While attribution is not definitive, this suggests the threat actors or targets may be located in Palestine/Gaza. The timing of the campaign coincides with increased tensions between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority in March-May 2017. The malware could potentially target either side, as well as Israel which was blamed for the Hamas assassination. The official-looking decoy documents suggest the targets may be government employees or contractors. In summary, the PDF analyzes a new malware campaign leveraging KASPERAGENT with a focus on targets in Palestine/Gaza, distributed via politically-themed decoy documents relevant to recent events there. Technical details, associated indicators of compromise, and screenshots of decoy files are available in ThreatConnect. "
Operation Cobalt Kitty; a global corporation; Asia; the attackers;,"The report analyzes an advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign dubbed Operation Cobalt Kitty carried out by a threat actor group called OceanLotus or APT-C-00. The group targeted a large Asia-based global corporation to steal proprietary data. The attack occurred in four phases over more than a year. Initial access was gained via spear-phishing. The attackers first used a fileless PowerShell infrastructure with Cobalt Strike and other payloads. After being detected, they quickly shifted to custom backdoors exploiting DLL side-loading in legitimate software. The backdoors used DNS tunneling for command and control, avoiding detection by firewalls. The attackers also developed a stealthy Outlook macro backdoor for command execution and data exfiltration. Credential harvesting and lateral movement followed using tools like Mimikatz. In later phases, the attackers continuously adapted their tactics, creating new variations of tools, bypassing mitigations like PowerShell restrictions, and restoring access. Their arsenal included customized credential dumpers, obfuscators, and bypass tools. In total, over 40 systems including critical servers were compromised over the year-long campaign. The attacker's tools went undetected by traditional security products, demonstrating APT groups' capabilities to evolve and evade defenses. The report provides extensive technical analysis of OceanLotus' tactics, techniques, and procedures. "
the report; ClearSky; the attacks; Iranian academic researchers; journalists; the US;,"The document reports on continued activity by the Iranian cyberespionage group Charming Kitten, also known as Phosphorus. Charming Kitten conducted attacks against US presidential campaign staff, US government officials, journalists, and Iranian dissidents in August-September 2019. This overlaps with attacks ClearSky researchers observed in July-August 2019 against academics, human rights activists, and Iranian opposition groups. The attacks leveraged similar tactics like password reset emails and spear phishing links impersonating Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo. Charming Kitten appears to be expanding operations from traditional academic and dissident targeting to now also interfere in democratic processes like elections. This is an evolution from previous Iranian cyber activity and more similar to tactics of Russian groups like APT28. New indicators show Charming Kitten gathering phone numbers for password recovery and two-factor authentication bypass. Four new spear phishing tactics were observed including SMS messages to target victims. The targeting of election staff represents an escalation and expansion of operations for Charming Kitten. The group is increasing sophistication and aligning more with Russian-style information operations and interference. Ongoing vigilance is recommended against this persistent threat group as they continue honing tactics. In summary, this documents the expanded cyberespionage operations of the Charming Kitten group against new target sets in 2019 using sophisticated impersonation tactics. Their activity poses an increasing threat of election interference moving forward. "
EwDoor; AT&T; 5.7k; a botnet; C,"The report analyzes a new IoT botnet called EwDoor that is targeting AT&T customers through vulnerabilities in Edgewater Networks devices. EwDoor was first observed on October 27, 2021 and has gone through several iterations, with its main capabilities being DDoS attacks and backdoor access. The botnet infects EdgeMarc devices to steal sensitive information and carry out DDoS attacks. The analysis examines EwDoor's technical details including its persistence mechanisms, device profiling, command and control communication, and anti-analysis protections. Key findings are that it uses BT trackers to retrieve C2 servers and TLS to encrypt traffic. During a brief visibility period, the botnet was tracked to around 5,700 infected devices located in the US and tied to AT&T's network. The true scale is estimated to be much larger based on certificate analysis. Overall, the report sheds light on a sophisticated new IoT botnet that is actively exploiting devices to compromise telephone networks. It provides an in-depth review of EwDoor's workings and capabilities as an emerging threat to monitor."
Chinese-linked hackers; a U.S. state legislature; July; the group;,"Cybersecurity firm Symantec reported that a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group known as Budworm or APT27 targeted a U.S. state legislature's network in July 2022. This marks the first confirmed attack by the group against U.S. targets in years, though Budworm has been active since at least 2013. The group typically targets industries and organizations to collect intelligence and has recently hit a Middle Eastern government, an electronics manufacturer, and now a U.S. state legislature. The specific details and effects of the attack on the legislature are unclear, but it involved compromising Apache Tomcat servers and deploying malware like HyperBro and PlugX. U.S. officials have warned of increasing Chinese cyber espionage threats aimed at stealing intellectual property and compromising sensitive networks. While Budworm was linked to frequent attacks on U.S. organizations years ago, it recently focused on Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. The legislature attack could signal a renewed focus on the U.S. The report concludes Budworm is a sophisticated, Chinese-linked threat actor that poses an active threat to government and private sector networks, as evidenced by this latest attack on a U.S. state legislature. "
September 17; a new attack; the Windows Error Reporting service; the attacker,"This Malwarebytes report analyzes a new fileless attack called Kraken that abuses the Windows Error Reporting service. The attack starts with a phishing email containing a weaponized Word doc that uses a malicious macro to load and execute a .NET payload called Kraken loader. The Kraken loader injects shellcode into the WerFault.exe process. The shellcode uses several anti-analysis techniques to detect sandboxes and debugging. It then makes an HTTP request to download and execute another payload from a compromised server. Kraken follows an APT-style attack pattern, including spear phishing for initial access, fileless techniques, anti-analysis, compromised infrastructure, and multi-stage modular code. There are loose connections to APT32 based on prior TTPs, but attribution is not definitive. Key technical aspects of Kraken are: - Macro document fetching remote templates to hide embedded exploits - Custom .NET loader for process injection - Shellcode resolving APIs dynamically and launching child threads - Anti-analysis checks for debuggers, VMs, and supported CPU features - Download and execution of a next-stage payload from a strategic web compromise The abuse of Windows Error Reporting for stealthy implant deployment highlights that attackers are continuing to innovate techniques and living off the land to bypass defenses. Kraken shows sophisticated tradecraft indicative of an advanced persistent threat actor. "
espionage; individuals; Taiwan; the malware; a PowerPoint slideshow;,"Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF: The document analyzes a malicious PowerPoint file that was distributed via spear-phishing to target individuals in Taiwan. The PowerPoint file exploits the Sandworm vulnerability CVE-2014-4114 to drop malware onto the system. This malware, dubbed ELISE by the researchers, establishes persistence and connects to command and control servers to enable further exploitation. Analysis of the malware shows it is likely associated with a threat actor group called Lotus Blossom that has been actively targeting Taiwan for espionage objectives. ELISE shares code similarities with other Lotus Blossom malware. It runs commands to gather system info, upload/download files, and open a remote shell. To evade detection, the malware creates an obese 500MB file with junk padding that likely triggers antivirus engines. The malware campaign shows Lotus Blossom is still actively targeting Taiwan using spear-phishing documents exploiting known vulnerabilities to gain a foothold on systems. Recommendations include enabling the provided Yara rules and network detection signatures to identify ELISE malware and C2 traffic. The document provides an in-depth look into the technical tactics, techniques, and procedures used in this targeted attack campaign against Taiwan. "
the report; ESET researchers; a supply-chain attack; an Israeli software developer;,"The PDF describes research by ESET on a new wiper malware called Fantasy that was deployed via a supply-chain attack by the threat actor group Agrius. Agrius abused an Israeli software developer's update mechanism to distribute the Fantasy wiper to customers in the diamond industry. The campaign began with reconnaissance activities in February 2022 at a South African diamond industry organization. Then on March 12th, Agrius deployed the Fantasy wiper and a lateral movement tool called Sandals to victims in South Africa, Israel, and Hong Kong over the span of around 3 hours. Fantasy is based on Agrius's previous wiper Apostle but does not disguise itself as ransomware. It recursively overwrites files on fixed drives with random data before deleting them. Sandals uses stolen credentials to spread Fantasy batch files to systems on the network via SMB and PsExec. Analysis shows Fantasy shares much code with Apostle. Both were written in .NET C# and have very similar functions for listing directories, deleting files, and more. Fantasy still contains remnants of Apostle's execution flow requiring an encoded XML key parameter. The supply-chain attack through the software updater allowed wide distribution of Fantasy across many customers of the developer. Though destructive, the attack was contained quickly, with ESET blocking Fantasy executions within hours. The developer also pushed out clean updates to end the campaign. "
Group-IB; Dark Pink; Asia-Pacific; Europe; the group; e,"The cybersecurity company Group-IB has discovered a new advanced persistent threat (APT) group called Dark Pink that has been actively attacking organizations in Asia-Pacific and Europe since mid-2021. Dark Pink has successfully breached at least 7 high-profile targets including military agencies, government bodies, and a religious organization. The group uses custom malware tools like TelePowerBot, KamiKakaBot, and information stealers Cucky and Ctealer to infiltrate networks and exfiltrate sensitive documents. The sophistication of Dark Pink's campaign is demonstrated by its multiple distinct kill chains and use of PowerShell scripts or commands. The main initial infection vector is spear-phishing emails posing as job applicants and containing ISO images with malware. Once executed, the malware ensures persistence on the system and collects information about the network. Lateral movement is achieved by infecting USB devices plugged into compromised machines. Exfiltration happens via Telegram API bots. The group uses evasion techniques like DLL side-loading to avoid detection. While the origin of Dark Pink is still unknown, their advanced custom tools, evolving tactics, and successful breaches of high-value targets demonstrate the serious threat they pose. Group-IB researchers are continuing efforts to uncover more details about this APT group and have notified confirmed and potential victims. The report aims to raise awareness about the TTPs used by Dark Pink to help organizations strengthen their security posture against such threats. "
the report; McAfee Labs; South Korea; March 20; the hard,"The document analyzes an cyberespionage operation called Operation Troy that targeted South Korea from 2009-2013. The operation involved various malware tools and tactics to infiltrate South Korean military and government networks to steal classified information. It started with a watering hole attack in 2009 that exploited a military social networking site. Later attacks likely involved spear-phishing. The malware used included remote access Trojans (RATs) like NSTAR, HTTP Troy, Tong, and TDrop which connected to command and control servers via encrypted IRC channels. The RATs scanned infected systems for interesting files and military keywords. Directory listings were sent to the C&C servers so attackers could selectively steal files. The RATs had wiper components that could destroy systems by wiping the MBR, as seen in the Dark Seoul incident in 2013. The various RAT versions reused code and components like bs.dll and payload.dll over the years, confirming the same group's involvement. Encryption, IRC nicknames, directory paths, and other tactics were consistent across the malware versions from 2009-2013. The campaign targeted military networks to gather intelligence. The stolen data was exfiltrated over an encrypted network. Two groups claimed responsibility - NewRomanic Cyber Army Team and Whois Hacking Team - but they appear to be a fabrication to hide the real threat actor. In summary, Operation Troy was a long-running cyberespionage campaign that relied on malware and encryption to infiltrate and steal military secrets from South Korea likely for strategic purposes. "
Palo Alto Networks; AcidBox; a new sophisticated threat actor; the Tur,"The report analyzes a rare malware family called AcidBox that was used in targeted attacks against Russian organizations in 2017.  AcidBox abuses a vulnerability in VirtualBox drivers that was previously used by the Turla APT group. It exploits additional unpatched vulnerabilities to disable driver signature enforcement and load its unsigned kernel driver. The malware uses a modular toolkit including loader modules installed as credential providers and a main worker module loaded from the registry. The main worker uses the VirtualBox exploit to load the kernel driver which can execute additional payloads. Analysis of artifacts like the compiler, export functions, custom status codes, and encryption indicates an advanced threat actor created AcidBox. While links to Turla are solely due to the reused exploit, attribution remains unclear. The malware managed to stay undetected until 2019. Its complex coding and targeted use suggest it was crafted for stealthy attacks and may still be in use today. Yara rules, IOCs, and a decryption script are provided to detect AcidBox."
Mandiant; an operation; Trojanized Windows 10 Operating System installers; Ukrainian government entities,"The document discusses threat activity tracked as UNC4166 targeting the Ukrainian government through trojanized Windows 10 installers distributed via torrent sites. The installers contained scheduled tasks that gathered system info and communicated with TOR C2 servers. If targets were deemed of interest, additional malware would be deployed for further reconnaissance and data theft, including the backdoors STOWAWAY, BEACON, and SPAREPART. SPAREPART in particular is a lightweight backdoor that generates random sleep times before beaconing to C2 infrastructure. The trojanized installers were designed to target Ukrainian users by utilizing the Ukrainian language pack. Multiple Ukrainian government organizations were compromised after installing the malware. While attribution could not be definitively made, UNC4166's targeting overlaps with previous GRU-related activity against Ukraine. The supply chain compromise and anti-detection capabilities indicate a sophisticated threat actor. Indicators of compromise and Yara rules are provided. "
IBM; IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services; IRIS,"The document describes research by IBM's X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) team into recent Shamoon malware attacks against organizations in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. - Shamoon is destructive malware that wipes computer hard drives. The recent attacks occurred in November 2016 and January 2017. - The IRIS team identified the initial point of compromise as weaponized Office documents with malicious macros. When opened, the macros executed PowerShell commands to enable command line access and communicate with attacker servers. - The attackers used PowerShell-laden documents themed as resumes and HR documents to target organizations and establish an initial foothold. The documents were likely delivered via spear phishing. - Analysis of the macro code shows it executed two PowerShell scripts - one downloaded additional malware, while the other used Metasploit functions to retrieve and execute a PowerShell payload from a remote server. - The attackers studied the networks and eventually deployed three files related to Shamoon, which enabled the coordinated malware outbreak to wipe hard drives. - The attacks affected thousands of computers across multiple organizations, destroying critical data and disrupting operations. - While the known Shamoon attacks have subsided after public exposure, the actors are expected to reappear in future waves with evolved tactics. Saudi Arabia has released alerts to help organizations defend against and prepare for potential Shamoon attacks. "
PDF; a report; Quick Heal Technologies Limited; Indian; 2019; the malware;,"The document details an investigation by Quick Heal Technologies into an advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign targeting Indian defense organizations dubbed ""Operation SideCopy."" The operation has been active since early 2019 and uses spearphishing emails with weaponized LNK files to infect victims and deploy a multi-stage malware infection chain. The initial infection delivers decoy documents and a HTA file that uses .NET serialization to execute additional payloads. The HTA stages use open source tools like CACTUSTORCH and DotNetToJScript for fileless techniques. The final payload is a remote access trojan (RAT) that allows the attackers to perform various malicious actions on the infected system. The RAT shares similarities with open source Delphi code on GitHub. The infrastructure includes domains registered with suspicious email IDs and C2 servers hosted with Contabo GmbH, which have been associated with Pakistan-linked threat actors. The attackers are constantly updating their tools and tactics and customizing malware after reconnaissance of the target networks. The operation copies TTPs associated with the Sidewinder APT group as a false flag, but evidence points to links with the Transparent Tribe APT instead. This APT focuses on targets in India, especially defense entities. IOCs are provided including HTA and malware hashes, domains, IPs, PDB paths, and other technical details identified during analysis. In summary, this appears to be an ongoing sophisticated, targeted attack campaign against Indian defense organizations by a suspected Pakistani APT group masquerading as a different threat actor. "
the threat actor; IRIDIUM; organizations; transportation; logistics; Ukraine; Poland,"The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has identified a new ransomware campaign called ""Prestige"" targeting organizations in the transportation and logistics industries in Ukraine and Poland. The ransomware was deployed on October 11 against multiple victims within an hour. MSTIC now attributes these attacks to the Russia-based threat actor IRIDIUM, which overlaps with Sandworm. This attribution is based on forensic artifacts linking IRIDIUM to interactive compromise of Prestige victims as early as March 2022. The Prestige attacks display some differences from other recent destructive attacks in Ukraine like FoxBlade/HermeticWiper and AprilAxe/CaddyWiper. However, it shares victimology with Russian state-aligned activity. Prior to deploying ransomware, IRIDIUM used remote execution tools like RemoteExec and Impacket for privilege escalation and credential theft. To deploy ransomware, IRIDIUM copied payloads to admin shares or domain controllers and executed via scheduled tasks, WMI, or group policy. Analysis of the Prestige ransomware shows it encrypts files with certain extensions and appends .enc, using Crypto++ library. It deletes backups and shadow copies, disables SQL Server, and drops a ransom note. Microsoft provides IOCs, detections, and security recommendations like enabling MFA, tamper protection, and investigating IOCs. Customers should harden defenses against ransomware, credential theft, and lateral movement techniques. "
Morphisec; a new.NET infostealer; Jupyter,"The report by Morphisec analyzes a new .NET infostealer malware called Jupyter discovered during an incident response investigation. Jupyter primarily targets Chromium, Firefox, and Chrome browser data, but also has backdoor capabilities. The attack starts with a downloader executable that impersonates legitimate software. It executes a .NET C2 client that can download additional payloads, run commands, and hollow code into system processes. The C2 uses a protocol with versioning and unique victim IDs. The C2 retrieves a PowerShell loader that decodes and runs the Jupyter infostealer payload. Jupyter exfiltrates browser data like cookies and credentials back to a command server. It copies data before accessing it to avoid detection. Jupyter has evolved through multiple versions since May 2020 to add capabilities like Firefox data theft, Windows startup folder persistence, and new communications protocols. Code analysis indicates it originates from a Russian developer. Morphisec concludes that Jupyter's constant evolution demonstrates the limitations of detection-based security tools. The company's moving target defense approach protects against these advanced unknown threats without needing to detect the attack chain. The report provides IOCs, YARA rules, and details on Jupyter's multi-stage attack process to help identify infections. Jupyter exemplifies sophisticated modular info stealers that evade defenses by frequently changing tactics. "
Operation Aurora; at least 2006; the malware; a Windows computer; a remote,"Operation Aurora refers to cyberattacks targeting major companies like Google and Adobe to steal intellectual property. The attacks used a JavaScript exploit in IE 6 to install a backdoor Trojan on target systems. The malware has been under development since at least 2006 and is of Chinese origin based on forensic evidence like the CRC algorithm. The command and control infrastructure uses dynamic DNS provided by a Chinese service. The initial infection downloads an encrypted dropper which installs the payload as a Windows service. The payload connects to command servers using a custom encryption scheme on port 443. The malware is controlled by operators to execute commands like stealing files or running remote commands. The full capabilities are flexible based on command numbers sent by the command server. The attacks are attributed to threat actors in China based on malware analysis, though definitive proof of Chinese government involvement is lacking. The malware economy has adopted the IE exploit for other operations. Recommended response includes blocking known command and control domains, using antivirus signatures to detect malware, and HBGary's inoculation tool to scan for and remove infections across a network. The report summarizes the technical details, capabilities, attribution and recommended response for the Operation Aurora attacks that targeted major corporations to steal intellectual property. "
Moonlight; individuals; the Middle East; over 200 samples; malware; over 200 samples;,"The document describes targeted cyberattacks against entities in the Middle East by a group referred to as ""Moonlight."" The attacks appear politically motivated for espionage rather than financial gain. The attacks target victims in the Middle East, primarily connecting from home networks. One notable victim is a Palestinian news organization. The attackers use social engineering tactics, sending emails with attachments or links that have .exe extensions disguised as legitimate files. The decoy documents have themes relevant to Middle Eastern politics. The attackers use the H-Worm malware as a first stage backdoor, delivering it via shortened URLs and domains impersonating Middle Eastern media groups. Later stages install the Remote Access Trojan (RAT) njRat to maintain persistence. The malware samples show evidence of manual creation rather than automated build processes. The command and control infrastructure consists of dynamic domains controlled via home internet connections in the West Bank of Palestine. Over 200 varied malware samples were identified. Earlier attacks were more opportunistic, but later attacks specifically targeted groups and individuals. The tools and targets indicate a possible connection to the Gaza Hacker Team. The attacks demonstrate that zero-days and exploits are not required for successful compromises. Instead, the group relies on basic scripts and obfuscation of known malware. The security implications are significant given the political motivations, even if the technical sophistication is low. The attacks could enable espionage and loss of life between rival factions. "

Cisco Talos; a new remote access trojan; MagicRAT; the Lazarus,"The blog post from Cisco Talos details their discovery of a new remote access trojan (RAT) called MagicRAT that they attribute to the North Korean state-sponsored cyber threat actor Lazarus Group. MagicRAT was found on victims initially compromised through exploits of publicly exposed VMware Horizon servers. It is programmed in C++ using the Qt Framework, likely to make analysis harder. It achieves persistence through scheduled tasks and contacts command and control servers for further instructions, allowing operators remote shell access and file management capabilities on infected machines. The operators can also use MagicRAT's infrastructure to deliver additional malware payloads, like a lightweight port scanner and updated versions of the Lazarus RAT called TigerRAT. TigerRAT has new capabilities like USB file dumping and skeleton code for webcam capture, though that code isn't implemented yet. Overlap between MagicRAT's infrastructure and previous Lazarus campaigns like Dtrack provides additional evidence for attribution to Lazarus. Cisco Talos assesses that the discovery of MagicRAT shows Lazarus' intent to rapidly develop bespoke malware alongside existing tools to target organizations globally. "
ThreatConnect; activity; Bellingcat; a key contributor; the MH17 investigation,"The report details cyber attacks by Russian threat actors against Bellingcat, an investigative journalism group that has published extensively on the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) over Ukraine in 2014. Bellingcat was targeted by spearphishing campaigns attributed to FANCY BEAR, a Russian advanced persistent threat group, from 2015-2016. The phishing emails spoofed Gmail security notifications and used shortened URLs to harvest credentials from Bellingcat researchers. In February 2016, the pro-Russian hacktivist group CyberBerkut compromised Bellingcat contributor Ruslan Leviev's email and accounts, defaced the Bellingcat website, and leaked his personal information. Leviev believes his SMS-based two-factor authentication was intercepted to access his Yandex email account. The report examines potential connections between FANCY BEAR and CyberBerkut based on similarities in infrastructure and targeting. Overlaps were found between documents leaked by CyberBerkut and the site DCLeaks, which has links to FANCY BEAR. The attacks are seen as retaliation for Bellingcat's reporting on the MH17 investigation implicating Russia. The report stresses that organizations publishing negative content about Russia can expect cyber operations intended to intimidate, influence or retaliate against them. It advises enabling two-factor authentication as a defense. "
MuddyWater; organizations; Middle Eastern; Asia; 2019; new campaigns; new tools;,"The PDF describes new findings on the threat actor group MuddyWater, which has been actively targeting organizations in Middle Eastern and Asian countries since at least 2017. The group continues to evolve its tactics, using new tools and payloads in 2019 campaigns. They have deployed various backdoors including POWERSTATS, CLOUDSTATS, SHARPSTATS, and DELPHSTATS. Some campaigns also used false flags to misattribute attacks to certain countries. Connections were found between MuddyWater and four Android malware variants, suggesting mobile users may also be targets. The malware has capabilities to steal data and spread itself via SMS. Potential target countries based on indicators include Turkey, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. In April 2019, details on MuddyWater's operations were leaked online. Trend Micro's monitoring revealed evidence corroborating some aspects of the leaks. The leaks contained images of the group's command and control infrastructure, source code, and past victim lists. MuddyWater uses direct IP addresses and a few domain names for command and control. Compromised WordPress sites have been used as proxies. Targets are mostly government entities in the Middle East and Asia, especially in finance, education, foreign affairs, defense, and telecom sectors. While MuddyWater does not seem to have access to zero-days, they have still compromised many targets through continuously evolving infection vectors, especially via email. Organizations should use strong email security and educate employees on email threats. "
the report; Cyberkov Security Incident Response team; CSIRT; Libyan Scorpion,"The document describes an investigation by Cyberkov Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) into a malware campaign targeting high-profile Libyan political and influential figures. In August 2016, CSIRT received reports of Android malware spreading in Libya via the Telegram messaging app. The malware was first discovered after a high-profile Telegram account was compromised from an IP address in Spain. The attackers then used the compromised account to spread malware disguised as a voice message to the account's contacts. Analysis revealed this was part of an ongoing politically-motivated malware operation since September 2015, aimed at intelligence gathering and spying. CSIRT named the threat actor group behind it the Libyan Scorpions. The Libyan Scorpions used social engineering and phishing to spread malware targeting Android and Windows devices. The malware allowed them to track locations and monitor targets. While not highly sophisticated technically, these kinds of attacks can still be effective. The report contains further details on the tactics, techniques and procedures used by the Libyan Scorpions. It also includes indicators of compromise to help the security community mitigate this threat. CSIRT notes that using malware to spy on and track individuals in an unstable warzone like Libya puts them at grave risk of assassination or kidnapping. "
the report; eset; Stuxnet; VERSUS AURORA;,"The document provides an in-depth technical analysis of Stuxnet 0.5, the earliest known version of the infamous Stuxnet malware. Stuxnet 0.5 dates back to November 2005 and was first detected in the wild in November 2007. It spreads only through infected Siemens Step 7 project files and has limited command and control capabilities compared to later versions. Stuxnet 0.5 is designed to target Siemens 417 PLCs used in uranium enrichment facilities by fingerprinting the industrial control system. It parses human-designated symbol labels to map device addresses and builds a special data block DB8061 used in the attack code. The attack involves replaying normal sensor signals while modifying output signals to close valves controlling uranium hexafluoride gas centrifuges. This excessive gas pressure can potentially damage centrifuges and enrichment systems. Later Stuxnet versions switched strategies to target centrifuge speeds directly rather than valves. Stuxnet 0.5 reveals the evolution of the malware from its early PLC valve attack strategy to the more advanced centrifuge speed attacks in 2009-2010. The modular, professionally developed code suggests the malware was created by a sophisticated team with insider knowledge of industrial control systems and funding/resources for a long-term operation. Stuxnet 0.5 provides valuable insight into the origins, early strategies, and development process of the groundbreaking cyberweapon. "
iDefense; a campaign; Goldfin; financial institutions; the Commonwealth of,"The document discusses a campaign dubbed Goldfin that has been active since February 2017 targeting financial institutions in Commonwealth of Independent States countries with spearphishing emails containing malware. The emails spoof legitimate banks and contain links to download an archive containing malicious JavaScript that ultimately delivers a malware implant called SOCKSBOT to compromised systems. SOCKSBOT is a backdoor capable of keylogging, screen capturing, downloading files, and arbitrary code execution. The malware uses various stages of obfuscated JavaScript and PowerShell scripts to eventually reflectively load SOCKSBOT into memory without writing files to disk. While some security vendors attribute the activity to APT CANDLEFISH, analysis of tactics, techniques, and procedures lead the researchers to assess with moderate confidence Goldfin is a distinct threat group not likely associated with CANDLEFISH. Noteworthy infrastructure and code overlaps are observed between Goldfin and FIN7, including shared domain WHOIS information, hosting IP addresses, and uncommon PowerShell obfuscation methods. While not enough to attribute Goldfin to FIN7, it reveals complex relationships in cybercrime. In total, the Goldfin campaign demonstrates a sophisticated, stealthy, and persistent threat targeting CIS financial organizations over an extended period for cyber espionage and financial gain. "

threat actor; Hong Kong pro-democracy figures; the malware; a,"The PDF describes targeted attacks by an unnamed threat actor against Hong Kong pro-democracy figures in late 2019. The attacks started with spear phishing emails containing Google Drive links to weaponized ZIP archives. The archives contained benign documents related to Hong Kong as lures, along with a LNK shortcut that remotely downloaded and executed malware. The malware was a Python-based backdoor that used the Dropbox API as a C2 channel. It collected system info, installed an autorun registry key for persistence, and could receive encrypted commands from the C2 server to execute on the victim machine. At least one pro-democracy target and one other victim in Hong Kong were infected. The attacker exfiltrated personal documents from the second victim related to travel and business. The threat actor also staged additional payloads on the C2 server including signed Microsoft utilities that were vulnerable to DLL sideloading attacks. This indicates they intended to escalate privileges and compromise further. The report concludes the attackers likely aimed to monitor people related to the Hong Kong protests, in order to understand the pro-democracy movement. The use of legitimate services like GitHub and Dropbox helped them bypass network defenses. Overall, the PDF provides a case study of how this particular threat actor leveraged spear phishing, living off the land binaries, and cloud services to infiltrate their targets and exfiltrate sensitive data related to the Hong Kong protests.

a Vietnamese financial services institution; PHOREAL/RIZZO; the malware,"Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF: The PDF describes an investigation by Elastic Security into a malware campaign targeting the financial sector in Vietnam. The malware is called PHOREAL/RIZZO, which is a backdoor that allows attackers to gain initial access and conduct further exploitation of victim networks. Elastic detected anomalous activity on a Windows endpoint, where the control.exe process was loading an unsigned DLL called tscon32.dll. Further analysis showed this DLL contained the PHOREAL malware, which has been attributed to the threat actor group APT32 (also known as OceanLotus). APT32 has been active since 2014, targeting organizations in Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam. PHOREAL appears to be used early in an intrusion to establish a foothold in the victim network. The malware contains an encrypted C2 domain which resolves to an IP address hosted by a company in Hong Kong. Elastic developed YARA rules to detect PHOREAL and enable collection of the malicious threads from memory. Recommendations include enabling memory protection capabilities in Elastic Agents, deploying the YARA rules, and blocking identified IOCs. In summary, this documents an incident where the PHOREAL backdoor linked to APT32 was detected being loaded into the control.exe process on a system in the Vietnamese financial sector. Analysis by Elastic Security provides technical details on the malware and recommendations for detection and response. "
the report; Palo Alto Networks; the threat actors; Operation Ke3c,"The report describes a cyberespionage operation called Operation Ke3chang conducted by a China-based threat actor group. Researchers discovered the group has evolved its malware arsenal and is using a new backdoor family called TidePool. The TidePool malware was used in attacks against Indian embassy personnel worldwide. The attacks involved weaponized documents exploiting the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability. Analysis uncovered similarities between TidePool and the BS2005 malware used previously by the Ke3chang group. The malware functionality includes gathering system info, reading/writing files, running commands, and exfiltrating data. The group continues to target organizations in sectors like government, technology, and telecommunications for espionage purposes. Research traced the malware evolution from samples before and after the 2013 Ke3chang report. Code reuse, registry modifications, C2 traffic, targeting, etc. provided evidence linking TidePool to the BS2005 malware. The ongoing attacks show Ke3chang remains active despite lack of public reporting. In summary, the threat actor group behind the Operation Ke3chang cyberespionage campaign evolved its tools over time but continues similar targeting. The new TidePool backdoor has ties to their previous BS2005 malware based on code reuse and behaviors. The group remains a threat with its compromise of Indian embassies using updated malware. "
Avast; ESET; the tools; at least 2020; data; companies; Southeast,"The document describes analysis done by Avast researchers on a new malware campaign called Worok, initially documented by ESET. Worok uses sophisticated techniques to infiltrate high-profile companies and governments in Asia to steal data. The initial infection vector is unknown but Avast found artifacts indicating DLL hijacking of Windows services like IKEEXT and SessionEnv may be used for lateral movement. The next stages use CLRLoader and PNGLoader to load the final payload extracted via steganography from PNG files. The steganographic embedding relies on least-significant bit (LSB) encoding, where data is embedded in the least-significant bits of every pixel. Avast captured additional PNGs containing a .NET payload called DropBoxControl that communicates with attacker controlled Dropbox accounts using the Dropbox API. It executes commands uploaded in request files and exfiltrates data into response files. The commands allow remote control for file manipulation, executing programs, sniffing network traffic etc. The attackers mainly use it to recursively collect documents, spreadsheets, emails etc. by packing them into encrypted RAR files. DropBoxControl shows lower code quality than earlier stages, indicating it was likely developed by a less skilled actor. The malware has targeted private companies and government entities across Asia, Africa and North America. Indicators of compromise like file hashes and email addresses are provided. The sophisticated techniques like steganography, Dropbox C2, and living off the land binaries allow Worok to operate stealthily. Avast's analysis provides further insight into this targeted campaign infiltrating high-value victims for data exfiltration. "
Operation Blockbuster; Novetta; the Lazarus Group; the Sony Pictures hack,"The Operation Blockbuster report details the investigation into the cyberattack against Sony Pictures in 2014. The attack caused significant financial and reputational damage to Sony and exposed how vulnerable corporations are against sophisticated cyber adversaries. A coalition led by Novetta identified the group behind the Sony attack, called the Lazarus Group. Through analysis of the malware used, the coalition linked the Lazarus Group to cyberattacks going back to at least 2009. The group has targeted government, military, media, aerospace, and critical infrastructure entities, mainly in South Korea and the United States. The evidence suggests the Sony attack was carried out by a well-resourced, motivated organization rather than a random hacktivist group. The malware analysis revealed the group consistently reuses code libraries across multiple malware families. Novetta generated signatures to detect the malware, disrupting the Lazarus Group's cyber capabilities. The report highlights the new role of private industry in cyber defense. Rather than just observing and reporting, the coalition took action to understand the threat and protect customers.

It encourages business leaders to learn from the Sony case and prioritize cybersecurity. "
the activities; TeamTNT; Linux; organizations; 2019; the group; use; cryptocurrency,"The PDF is a report from Trend Micro about a malicious hacking group called TeamTNT. TeamTNT is a group of at least 12 people, likely German-native speakers, who hack systems to steal credentials and deploy cryptocurrency miners. TeamTNT targets Linux environments and cloud infrastructures. They use scanners to find vulnerable systems, then deploy payloads like credential stealers for SSH, AWS, Docker, and more. They also deploy cryptocurrency miners, IRC bots for command and control, and rootkits like Diamorphine for stealth. TeamTNT runs campaigns with names like Covid-19, Black-T, Kinsing Killer, and AWS Stealer. The group evolves their tactics, using advanced techniques like searching for misconfigurations instead of exploits. In 2020-2021, TeamTNT increasingly focused on stealing cloud credentials and mining cryptocurrency in the cloud. The impact of TeamTNT's cryptojacking can be high. Based on observed wallet IDs, Trend Micro estimates TeamTNT mined over 17 Monero coins worth around $3,800. But the electricity cost to mine that amount would be around $12,000. Stolen cloud credentials could also let TeamTNT access confidential data or install more malware. Trend Micro recommends security practices like least privilege access, private key SSH authentication, patching, and using cloud-focused security solutions. They also provide technical details on TeamTNT's malware like IRC bots, credential stealers, and the Diamorphine rootkit. "
the document; a new class; RC4 encryption; signature block verification; polymorph,"The document provides a technical analysis of a novel piece of Chinese malware named ""BendyBear"" by Palo Alto Networks researchers. BendyBear is a sophisticated shellcode module used as a downloader for cyber espionage operations by the threat actor group BlackTech, which has ties to China.

The shellcode's goal is to download a second stage implant from a command and control server. The analysis provides details on how the shellcode executes, decrypts configurations, communicates with the C2 server using a custom encryption scheme, and loads the second stage payload directly in memory. Multiple anti-analysis features are highlighted such as clearing DNS caches, PEB modifications, polymorphic code, and debugger checks. Comparisons are drawn between BendyBear and WaterBear in terms of encryption, payload delivery, signature checks, and evasion capabilities. Indicators of compromise are included for the shellcode samples, C2 domains, and WaterBear loaders identified. The shellcode demonstrates sophisticated coding and attempts to evade detection through its implementation. "
the Platinum group; APT; South and Southeast Asia; the malware; Trojan; a,"The PDF describes an advanced persistent threat (APT) group called Titanium, which is believed to be operated by the Platinum group. The main targets of Titanium are located in South and Southeast Asia. Titanium uses a complex multi-stage attack process to infiltrate target networks. It starts with an exploit to gain initial access, followed by multiple stages of downloaders, decryptors, and installers that eventually deploy a remote access trojan backdoor on the victim's system. Each stage of the attack chain mimics legitimate software to avoid detection. For example, the downloaders pretend to be security software, DVD authoring tools, or audio drivers. Encryption is used extensively to conceal malware files and network communications. The final payload is a backdoor that can receive commands from the command and control server to carry out actions like stealing files, executing commands, and uploading additional payloads. It uses steganography techniques to hide its traffic inside PNG image files. Persistence is achieved by installing the backdoor as a malicious service or hijacking COM objects. The backdoor configuration data reveals information like command and control addresses, encryption keys, and user agent strings. While active campaigns have not been recently observed, the complexity and sophistication of the Titanium operation shows how advanced adversaries are continually evolving their tactics, techniques, and procedures. "
the second half of 2016; ESET researchers; TeleBots; the malware; targets;,"The report analyzes attacks by a threat actor group called TeleBots against financial institutions in Ukraine in 2016. TeleBots is believed to have evolved from the BlackEnergy group responsible for attacks on Ukraine's energy sector in 2015-2016. The initial infection vector is spear-phishing emails containing Excel docs with malicious macros. The macros drop malware that retrieves a Python-based backdoor called TeleBot. This backdoor abuses Telegram's bot API to communicate with the attackers. TeleBot can execute commands, upload files, and take screenshots. It drops other tools like password stealers, keyloggers, and network sniffers to facilitate lateral movement and data theft. A separate VBS backdoor is also deployed as backup access. The end goal is deployment of KillDisk, a wiper malware that destroys critical system files to render computers inoperable. KillDisk was used in prior BlackEnergy attacks. Attribution is difficult as TeleBots uses some TTPs that overlap with BlackEnergy. But the new backdoors, infrastructure, and targeting indicate it is a distinct, more active evolution of BlackEnergy focused on sabotage. The report provides indicators of compromise and recommendations on blocking malicious macros, securing credentials, monitoring network traffic, and detecting malware to defend against TeleBots. "
APT41; German; March 2022; a ransom note; multiple workstation,"The document describes an investigation by DCSO CyTec into a campaign conducted by APT41 against a German financial company. The initial intrusion occurred in March 2021 via exploitation of ProxyLogon vulnerabilities in Exchange Server. The actor installed a China Chopper webshell for persistence. After over a year of inactivity, the actor returned in March 2022, having retained access via the webshell. The actor conducted credential dumping with Procdump and lateral movement to a domain controller. The DC was used to stage tools and run discovery scripts to identify targets. The actor leveraged commercial encryption software Jetico BestCrypt to encrypt servers and Microsoft BitLocker to encrypt workstations. Batch scripts were used to automate deployment across systems. Ransom notes were distributed demanding bitcoin. While encryption was attempted across many systems, it was blocked by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Forensics showed the actor's tactics, including living off the land tools, deleting scripts, and RDP access via NATBypass. Overlaps exist with other campaigns attributed to APT41. In summary, APT41 retained access via webshell, conducted discovery, and attempted ransomware deployment which was ultimately unsuccessful due to endpoint detection. The incident highlights the group's ongoing targeting of foreign corporations using ransomware, encryption software, and native tools. "
Fidelis Cybersecurity; a 64-bit Linux kernel module; the malware; the,"The document analyzes a Linux variant of the Derusbi malware used in a campaign dubbed ""Turbo"" that targeted a U.S. public research institution in 2015. The 64-bit Linux sample is notable as most Derusbi variants target Windows. Analysis revealed the use of a malicious Linux kernel module called Turbo that was dropped and installed to hide processes. Both the malware and kernel module use anti-forensics techniques like running only in memory and overwriting data to evade detection. The malware gathers system info like GCC version, likely to aid in recompiling the malware or kernel module on the victim system. The malware creates a raw network socket for command and control communication, mimicking Windows Derusbi samples in terms of HTTP headers and encryption. It can execute commands, provide a remote shell, and perform file operations. Turbo hooks the system call table to hide processes specified by the malware. It uses a netlink socket for kernel-to-userspace communication. The malware sends module requests like hide_pid() to control Turbo's process hiding. The report suggests the Derusbi developer may be actively involved in operations, with samples recompiled on deployment day. Shared infrastructure with Windows PlugX samples also indicates coordinated use of tools. The investment to port Derusbi to Linux and continued evolution of tactics/tools highlights the adversary's sophistication and motivation to expand access into Linux environments beyond Windows. Detection requires proactive threat hunting across endpoints and networks. "

The malware continues the group's efforts to target high-profile victims on multiple platforms. Defenders should block the command and control infrastructure. "
RSA Research; a malware-supported VPN network; Terracotta; Shell_C,"The report exposes a VPN service called Terracotta that operates multiple brands marketed in China. Terracotta has over 1500 nodes globally, at least 30 of which are confirmed to be compromised Windows servers harvested without consent. Terracotta appears to obtain servers by brute forcing remote desktop credentials on Internet-exposed Windows systems. Custom malware like Gh0st RAT and backdoors are installed to control nodes. Nodes are configured to use Terracotta's centralized authentication infrastructure. The report speculates the illicit harvesting of servers and bandwidth significantly reduces Terracotta's operating costs compared to legitimately leasing infrastructure. Nodes masquerade as unrelated organizations rather than being obvious VPN exits. Terracotta is assessed to originate from China based on patterns of life, tools, and operating hours. Nodes have been used by advanced threat actors like Shell_Crew for attacks, taking advantage of the anonymity. Other nation-state activity has been observed originating from Terracotta. The report provides indicators of compromise and recommendations on preventing server compromises through basics like firewalling, renaming admin accounts, and strong passwords. Detection methods include monitoring for VPN authentication traffic and Terracotta-associated malware. Though exploitation tactics are simple, Terracotta represents a concerning trend of hybrid criminal-state actors stealing infrastructure to enable espionage. Defenders must implement controls to prevent servers becoming speechless victims enabling attacks. "
