"
the attacker; access; the ScatterBee packing mechanism; control flow obf, 1. The attacker delivers trojanized software like Flash installers to victims. 2. The trojanized software drops and executes a malicious DLL loader and a ScatterBee packed ShadowPad payload. 3. The loader deobfuscates the payload using the ScatterBee technique and reflective loads it into memory. 4. ShadowPad establishes command and control communication and allows the threat actor remote access to compromise the victim over the long term. 
MuddyWater; spearphishing emails; links; archives; OneHub; the archive,"1. MuddyWater sends phishing emails containing links or HTML attachments. 2. The links and attachments lead to archives hosted on services like OneHub, Dropbox, and OneDrive. 3. The archives contain installers for remote administration tools like ScreenConnect and Syncro. 4. Victims are tricked into installing the tools, enabling MuddyWater persistent access. 5. MuddyWater sets up new Syncro instances and subdomains for each phishing campaign. 6. Full control of compromised systems is achieved through Syncro including data exfiltration. 7. Additional payloads can be deployed using the remote access. 8. Targets include organizations in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. 9. Phishing lures impersonate legitimate companies relevant to the target. 10. Poor grammar and formatting evades detection as a phishing attempt. "
the attacker; a link; GoogleDrive; the victim; a zip file; tro,"1. Victims receive links to compressed archives hosted on Google Drive containing shortcut files masquerading as JPEGs or PDFs. 2. When the shortcuts are opened, they execute a command to extract and run a Javascript agent. 3. The agent gathers system info and checks for antivirus software. 4. It retrieves its C2 server from hidden web pages on GitLab and DigitalPoint. 5. The agent communicates with the C2 via HTTP to upload/download files, run commands, harvest cookies, and run scripts. 6. The agent persists by adding registry run keys. 7. It also modifies the registry to weaken security settings in IE and disable certain antivirus protections. "
phishing emails; macros; the victim; the document; the macro; PE;," 1. Threat actors send phishing emails with COVID-19 themes and malicious attachments to target victims. The attachments are typically weaponized Office documents like Word, Excel, PowerPoint files. 2. If the document contains a template injection attack, upon opening, it fetches a remote malicious template that gets executed. The template usually contains a macro. 3. If the document contains a malicious macro directly, it gets triggered automatically when the document is opened. The macros are often obfuscated to evade detection. 4. The macro then extracts and decrypts an embedded executable payload or reaches out to download one from a remote server. 5. The decrypted payload is a malware module, commonly a remote access Trojan (RAT) or banking Trojan. 6. The malware module contains capabilities to collect sensitive information from the infected system, communicate with command and control servers, download additional modules, and allows remote control. 7. Finally, the infiltrated system's data is exfiltrated back to the threat actor's servers. The access can also be leveraged to move laterally within networks. "
White Tur; weaponised documents; exploits; CVE-2017-0199; HTA," 1. White Tur sends phishing emails with weaponized documents, HTA or PowerShell scripts. 2. Scripts and macros in the documents retrieve and execute malware payloads. 3. One method injects PowerShell into a Visual Studio project file to download malware masked as a OneDrive DLL. 4. Another PowerShell script exfiltrates system info before downloading the malware payload. 5. A Windows binary backdoor payload carries out functions like command execution, file operations, and setting sleep times. "
the attackers; targets; malicious.PDF files; exploits; CVE-2009,1. The attacker sends a spearphishing email with a malicious PDF attachment to the target. 2. The PDF exploit triggers a vulnerability like CVE-2009-4324 when opened by the target. 3. The exploit drops malware onto the target system that provides remote access. 4. The malware connects to a command and control (C&C) server controlled by the attacker. 5. The C&C server sends commands to control the target system and steal data. 6. The attacker leverages access to move laterally in the network and compromise additional systems. 7. The attacker obscures their activities using compromised servers and proxy tools. 8. The attacker pursues long-term persistent access to the target network. 
the attackers; a fake VPN Web Portal; University of Oxford; conferences; job application,"1. OilRig set up fake websites impersonating a VPN portal, University of Oxford sites, and job portals. 2. The fake sites hosted malware bundled with legitimate software like Juniper VPN clients and CV creators. 3. OilRig sent emails to targets with links to the fake sites or attached weaponized Office documents. 4. If users visited the fake sites and downloaded files, the bundled malware would infect their systems. 5. The malware connected to C2 domains to receive commands and exfiltrate data. 6. OilRig used valid but likely stolen code signing certificates to digitally sign the malware and avoid detection. 7. The malware established persistence and harvested information from compromised systems. 8. Infrastructure overlaps suggest links between OilRig and other Iranian threat groups. "
the attackers; macros; Middle East; Palestine; the macro; the document;,"1. The attacker distributes macro-enabled Office documents containing geo-political lures. 2. The victim enables macros which execute a PowerShell command to download the malware executable. 3. The malware executable collects system info and exfiltrates it to the attacker's Dropbox account. 4. The malware connects to the attacker's Dropbox to fetch commands and additional payloads. 5. The malware receives commands to take screenshots, collect files, and download/execute additional executable payloads. 6. The malware sends the collected data and screenshots back to the attacker's Dropbox. "
Scarlet Mimic; spear; emails; targets; exploits; vulnerabilities; FakeM," 1. The Scarlet Mimic group sends spearphishing emails with malicious document attachments to targets in the Tibetan community. 2. The documents exploit vulnerabilities to install malware like FakeM on the target's system. 3. The malware connects to C2 servers on dynamic DNS domains for further control. 4. Over time, the Tibetan community promotes safer practices like avoiding attachments. 5. Scarlet Mimic shifts to phishing emails with links instead of attachments. 6. The phishing pages are hosted on old C2 infrastructure domains. 7. Targets who enter credentials on the phishing pages are redirected to decoy content. 8. The group adapts phishing themes to match current events and interests in the Tibetan community. "
