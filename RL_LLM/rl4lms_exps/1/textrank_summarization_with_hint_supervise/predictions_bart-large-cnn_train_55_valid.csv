"The report by Mandiant describes the investigation of a novel malware ecosystem impacting VMware ESXi and ESXi hypervisors that enables persistent access by a threat actor to evade detection.The initial infection vector was via malicious vSphere Installation Bundles (VIBs) used to install two new malware families - VIRTUALPITA and VIRTIALPIE.The VIBs were distributed through the PartnerSupported and CommunitySupported partners.When the --force flag is set, a listener is triggered to enable arbitrary command execution of the VIB payloads.VirtualPitA is a Python-based backdoor that has similar capabilities as vmtoolsd.exe.It can execute commands, upload/download files, disable logging services, and more.The malware allows persistent administrative access to the hypervisor, send commands to guest VM hosts, and execute arbitrary commands from one VM to another.It uses the Host Acceptance Level (HALF) header to specify when to boot and load VIB files, indicating the host is being supported by PartnerSupported or CommunitySupported.VIBIE uses the HALF header as a listener to receive commands from the Hypervisor Loader (HLF) and can execute them at runtime.It has capabilities like file exfiltration, command execution, and compression.Samples were also found on Linux vCenter systems hosted on ESXi.VMCI is a Chinese threat actor focused on China-themed malware.The report provides technical details on how to detect VIB(E) files being used for this purpose.In summary, the report provides an in-depth analysis of the infection vectors, installation methods, and associated with this novel attack ecosystem impacting ESXi, vCenter, Linux, and Windows environments.It highlights the need for endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to detect and block such threats.","The PDF document from Mandiant details the investigation of novel malware being deployed on VMware ESXi hypervisors by a threat actor tracked as UNC3886.The malware ecosystem enables persistent administrative access to the hypervisor, command execution on guest VMs, file transfers between the hypervisor and VMs, tampering with logs, and executing commands between VMs on the same hypervisor.The malware was initially detected when commands were seen coming from the vmtoolsd process on a Windows VM hosted on an ESXi hypervisor.Analysis of the ESXi boot profiles revealed malicious VIBs (vSphere Installation Bundles) being used to deploy backdoors called VIRTUALPITA and VIRTUALPIE on the hypervisors after reboot.The VIBs were signed as PartnerSupported though they were actually CommunitySupported, allowing installation with the --force flag.VIRTUALPITA creates a listener on the hypervisor for arbitrary command execution, file transfers, and starting/stopping logging.VIRTUALPIE is a Python backdoor with similar capabilities.Commands executed on the hypervisor are sent to guest VMs via vmtoolsd.exe for execution.This was used for file enumeration, compression, and credential dumping.VARIUALPITA samples were also found on Linux vCenter systems masquerading as a legitimate process.Windows VMs hosted on the compromised hypervisors contained VIRTUALGATE, a utility that uses VMCI sockets to run commands on guest VMs from the hypervisor.Based on the nature of the intrusions, Mandiant assesses UNC3886 has a likely China nexus and espionage motivations.Indicators of compromise, Yara rules, and recommendations for hardening ESXi/vSphere environments are provided."
"The PDF describes research by Gemini into a malware campaign by the threat actor group Fin7 using trojanized USB devices as virtual keyboards in ""BadUSB"" attacks.The key points are: - FIN7 used an Arduino sketch file called ""sketch_jul31a.ino"" to install malware on USB devices masquerading as keyboards.- The sketch sent keystrokes to a hidden PowerShell script that downloaded and installed the IceBot remote access trojan (RAT) - Analysis of the sketch file revealed it contained an IP address for a command and control panel containing information about infected systems and OS versions.- One infected system showed a control panel with a list of infected systems, indicating the RAT was installed.- Firewalls blocked the network, so FIN7 was able to gain unauthorized remote access to the victim's systems.The RAT uses encoded commands and scripts to communicate with command servers.It exfiltrates data and can execute commands, upload files, and more.- Fin7 has been using the Arduino platform to build sketch files to install their malware on infected USB devices.The sketch files connect to a repository and download additional payloads from the attacker's code.- By infecting USB devices, FIN7 gained unauthorized access to victim networks and could deploy ransomware, kill firewalls, and move laterally in the network.In summary, the PDF provides an in-depth analysis of how the Fin7 group leverages the Arduino microcontroller platform to install malicious USB devices and keystroke injection malware disguised as keyboards, and how this allows them to bypass defenses.","The cybercrime group FIN7 has been using ""BadUSB"" attacks to spread malware.They distribute USB devices containing malicious Arduino sketches that act as keyboards.When plugged in, the sketch executes PowerShell to download and install the IceBot remote access trojan (RAT).This allows FIN7 to gain unauthorized access to target networks.Analysis of the sketch code shows it opens a hidden PowerShell window to download the trojan from IP addresses linked to FIN7.The RAT then connects to FIN7 command and control servers.A control panel was discovered showing systems infected with IceBot, including info like IP, OS, antivirus, and options to interact with the RAT.This attack method avoids firewalls and email filters by not transmitting malware over the network.Encoding and scripts minimize malware files for stealth.FIN7 recently created a fake security company potentially to construct trojanized USBs.They may be using unwitting admins or sending them to clients for social engineering.The USB-based attack represents an evolution in tactics for FIN7 to gain persistent access and evade protections as they expand into ransomware operations.Defenses should focus on physical media controls and monitoring for suspicious USB activities."
"The PDF describes a targeted malware campaign called Operation GreedyWonk that compromised websites focused on national security and foreign policy.Visitors were redirected to an exploit server that hosted a zero-day Flash vulnerability.The exploit bypassed Windows' Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protections to bypass XP and Java.It also bypassed the ASLR protections in Microsoft Office 2007/2010.The group behind this campaign appears to have sufficient resources and a determination to infect foreign policy and defense related sites for follow-on data theft.By breaking the exploit's ASLR-bypass measures, they do prevent the current in-the-wild exploit from functioning.The report provides technical details on how the exploit works, including the use of a hardcoded ROP chain for Windows XP, the hardcoded MSVCRT files for Windows 7 and Java, and the bypassing of ASLR using the HXDS.dll DLL.In addition, the report analyzes the command and control infrastructure used by the attackers, including domains, IP addresses, and file hashes.It provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, domain names, and IP addresses associated with this campaign.The campaign shows the group behind Operation SnowMan is a credible threat actor with resources to compromise foreign policy sites.The actor aims to gain persistence and early access to target networks before deploying other malware families.","The document describes an attack campaign dubbed ""Operation GreedyWonk"" that was discovered in February 2014.The campaign involved compromising multiple websites related to economic policy, foreign affairs, and national security.Visitors to these compromised sites were redirected to an exploit server hosting a zero-day Flash exploit (CVE-2014-0502).The goal was to infect visitors, especially those interested in defense and public policy matters, with malware for follow-on data theft.The exploit bypassed Windows ASLR protections by targeting systems still running Windows XP or having outdated Java and Microsoft Office.Once the exploit succeeded, it installed a remote access trojan called PlugX/Kaba.This malware variant was compiled shortly before discovery, indicating it was specifically built for this campaign.Researchers believe GreedyWonk may be connected to an earlier 2012 campaign that used similar tradecraft and infrastructure.Malware samples from both campaigns connected to overlapping domains that previously resolved to the same IP addresses.The group behind the campaigns appears sufficiently resourced to access zero-days and remains a credible threat.The report highlights the actor's persistence in compromising policy and defense-related websites, early access to exploits, ability to re-compromise sites, and deployment of various malware families.This demonstrates an adversary with mature capabilities that continues to pose a threat through strategic web compromises to infect visitors from specific communities."
"The document analyzes a malware campaign by the Mac malware group Lazarus that was discovered on August 16, 2022.The malware is a signed executable disguised as a job description for the cryptocurrency company Coinbase that was uploaded to VirusTotal from a server in Brazil.It drops a signed Mach-O executable similar to one that was found a year ago.This time, the malware is signed with a valid certificate issued to a developer named Shankey Nohria and team identifier 264HFWQH63.It is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon and drops three files: a decoy PDF, a bundle FinderFontsUpdater.app, and a downloader safarifontagent.app.The bundle is signed using a certificate issued in February 2022 but notarized and revoked on August 12.The Windows counterpart of this malware was also found on August 4, showing it was likely part of the same Lazarus Mac malware campaign.While the Windows malware is different, the Windows version shows the same decoy document and downloader link to a different C2 server.In summary, the document provides an analysis of a Mac malware operation by Lazarus targeting the cryptocurrency industry using signed malware disguised as job descriptions, likely for MacOS and iOS.It provides technical details on the malware's components, C2 infrastructure, and Windows counterpart.","ESET researchers discovered a new malware campaign targeting Mac users that is attributed to the Lazarus threat group.On August 16, 2022, ESET announced on Twitter that a signed Mac executable disguised as a Coinbase job description was uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil.This is similar to a campaign ESET uncovered in May 2022 originating from Singapore.The malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures.It drops three files: a PDF job description decoy, a bundle called FinderFontsUpdater.app, and a downloader called safarifontagent.The bundle is signed with a certificate issued in February 2022 that Apple revoked on August 12, 2022.Unlike the May campaign, this version connects to a different command and control server at concrecapital[.]com.The server did not respond when analyzed.On August 4, 2022, another security researcher found a Windows version dropping the same PDF and connecting to a different C2.ESET believes this new activity is part of Lazarus' Operation In(ter)ception campaign targeting Mac users.The malware bypasses security products by disguising itself as a legitimate job application.The use of code signing and targeting of cryptocurrency companies indicates the likely purpose is cyberespionage and financial theft.ESET provided hashes for the dropped files and C2 domain to help identify infections.They assess this demonstrates Lazarus' continued efforts to breach MacOS devices through social engineering and Trojanized applications."
"The PDF describes research by Talos on malware samples submitted to dynamic analysis systems like VirusTotal and Anubis that showed possible links to advanced persistent threat (APT) groups.The research was conducted by dissecting the Anubis sandbox dataset which consisted of over 30M samples collected in six years.It revealed that attribution for some sophisticated malware samples was difficult due to mislabeling.The Talos samples were mislabeled as non-malicious but linked to APT campaigns by some researchers after months or years before being attributed to the proper threat actor.Talos chose 10 APT malware campaigns from 2010-2015, some of which were already covered in previous USENIX Security 2015 paper.The malware samples showed links to other APT groups like Aurora and APT-RAT Regin Net TravellerBrutPOS.Analysis of the Talos and Cisco AMP datasets revealed links between the malware samples and telemetry from Cisco's security products as well.The analysis revealed the malware authors directly interacted with sandboxes during development before submitting samples for analysis, indicating they were aware the malware was under development at the time it was submitted to sandboxes.The samples were found in various stages of development for months prior to being submitted for analysis.Some samples were submitted as recently as 458 days before detection by security vendors.While detection of an APT campaign can happen quickly on VirusTotal or Anubis, attribution can take longer on the Cisco platform.In summary, the analysis of the Cisco samples and AMP telemetry revealed possible links between APT and Talos malware from years prior to detection.It highlights the challenges in attributing malware to specific threat groups through mislabelling and misattribution.","The PDF is a blog post by Cisco Talos describing their analysis of past APT malware campaigns in their threat intelligence datasets.They looked at 10 major APT campaigns made public between 2010-2015, including campaigns like Aurora, Equation, Red October etc.Attribution is not discussed.They searched for these malware samples in the Talos malware zoo (feeds from AV companies, researchers etc.)and found samples for most campaigns existed in their zoo months or years before public disclosure of the APT campaigns.On average, it took 458 days after initial detection for samples to be publicly tied to an APT campaign.The gap was as high as 3 years for Equation samples.Analysis of VirusTotal submitters showed certain entities had submitted samples from multiple campaigns, indicating possible links between campaigns or actors.In the Cisco AMP customer telemetry, they found pre-dated samples related to 3 campaigns.Most were detected as malicious when first seen, but some evaded initial detection.The post concludes that while detection happens quickly, connecting samples to campaigns takes longer due to high volumes of generic malware.Sandbox evasion also delays detection.Their findings validate that threat actors submit samples to test defenses prior to attacks.Better analytics are needed to identify and correlate samples early to discover stealthy campaigns in progress."
