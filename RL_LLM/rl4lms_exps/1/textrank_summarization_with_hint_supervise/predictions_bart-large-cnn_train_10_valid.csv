"The document analyzes the malware Raspberry Robin, also known as Raspberry Robin.Raspberry Robin is a DLL backdoor that uses various tricks to evade detection.Roshtyak is packed in as many as 14 protective layers, each heavily obfuscated and serving a specific purpose.The obfuscation allows persistence and privileges to be added, as well as use of exploit exploits like PsExec and ROP.ROP is a ROP that connects to Tor and has a random name.The payload is a self-extracting package that contains a tool called iexpress that exfiltrates system info.It communicates with command and control servers for remote code execution.The fake payload uses control flow flattening, activation keys, and other tricks to avoid detection.It enters an infinite loop where it crashes on itself.This has the same purpose as the obfuscation, but may not be intentional as it might not be clear if the crash was intentional.The malware uses anti-sandbox evasion techniques to evade analysis.It uses multiple checks to detect sandboxing and anti-virus evasion across layers.The combination of heavy obfuscation and advanced anti-analysis tricks makes analysis challenging.The report aims to educate fellow researchers on the tricks used by Raspberry Robin and to make them more resistant to evasion techniques like this malware.It aims to make analysis more challenging and harder to achieve.","The PDF discusses the malware Raspberry Robin, specifically focusing on its heavily protected DLL backdoor called Roshtyak.Roshtyak employs numerous advanced anti-analysis techniques to avoid detection, including anti-debugger, anti-sandbox, anti-VM, and anti-emulation checks.If any check succeeds in detecting the analysis environment, Roshtyak will terminate itself, crash intentionally, enter an infinite loop, or execute fake adware payload.The fake payload tricks analysts into thinking the malware is harmless.Roshtyak's code is heavily obfuscated through control flow flattening, function activation keys, variable masking, and other techniques.It is packed in up to 14 layers, each serving a specific protective purpose.The obfuscation hinders static analysis.The core functionality of Roshtyak is to establish persistence, escalate privileges, move laterally, and download additional payloads.The malware uses encrypted kernel exploits to escalate privileges, which are decrypted on demand.Roshtyak downloads PsExec on demand from a specific URL and drops it into a temporary directory under a random name.The payload to be executed by PsExec is a self-extracting package created by a tool called IExpress, which is an ancient Windows installer.It profiles victims by collecting system information and exfiltrating it to C2 servers over Tor.The servers can respond with new shellcode for execution.Reverse engineering Roshtyak is very challenging due to the combination of heavy obfuscation and numerous advanced anti-analysis tricks.The PDF aims to help fellow researchers recognize and respond to similar malware tricks, and harden analysis environments against the described evasion techniques."
"The document analyzes cyber espionage activity by a threat actor group called UNC4191 targeting public and private sector entities primarily in Southeast Asia and Europe.The threat actor has a China nexus and relies heavily on initial infection via USB devices.The initial infection vectors include USB Drive.exe and Removable Drive.executable.The malware self-replicates by infecting new removable drives that are plugged into compromised systems.This allows the malicious payloads to propagate to additional systems and potentially collect data from air-gapped systems.The group also deploys side-loading malware like MISTCLOAK, DARKDEW, and BLUEHAZE to exfiltrate data from infected systems.They use signed binaries to side-load additional payloads like a reverse shell to execute commands from command and control servers.Successful compromise led to the deployment of a renamed NCAT binary and execution of reverse shell on the victim's system, providing backdoor access to the threat actor.NCAT is a command/control utility written for the Nmap Project.While NCAT may be used for legitimate purposes, threat actors may also use it to upload or download malware, upload backdoors, create reverse shells, and tunnel traffic to evade network controls.Once installed, NCAT can upload files, download binaries, upload data, and more.It can also upload and download backdoors to a C2 server, upload files from the C2, or send data to a remote server.The report provides technical details on the malware families used, including how they are signed, compiled, and distributed, and how they communicate with command/controlled servers.It reveals the group's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are evolving in response to evolving threats.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look into the evolving cyberespionage activities by a Chinese state-sponsored group with a focus on Southeast Asia, Europe, and U.S. interests.It highlights the need for continuous threat hunting to detect and respond to this activity using real-time threat detection and threat intelligence combined with threat intelligence tools.","The PDF describes a cyberespionage campaign called UNC4191 that targeted organizations primarily in Southeast Asia, as well as some in the US, Europe, and Asia Pacific.The threat actor has a suspected China nexus.Initial infection vectored used USB devices.Malicious binaries named USB Drive.exe or Removable Drive.exe were executed by users when plugging in compromised USB drives.The binaries sideloaded and executed the malware MISTCLOAK, DARKDEW, and BLUEHAZE.MISTCLOAK decrypts and executes DARKDEW from an encrypted file on the USB drive.DARKDEW self-replicates by infecting any new USB drives plugged into the compromised system.It steals data from air-gapped systems this way.BLUEHAZE uses a signed binary to sideload itself.It opens a reverse shell to a command and control server using NCAT.Successful compromise allows the threat actor to maintain persistent access and carry out intelligence collection.The campaign appears to have started around September 2021 based on compile timestamps of the malware samples.New detections were created in Managed Defense to identify this activity, enabling rapid response.Indicators of compromise are provided.Mandiant will continue monitoring the campaign and provide updates on changes in TTPs or new tools."
"The report by researchers at Lookout details mobile malware campaigns targeting the Uyghur ethnic group that have been active since at least 2013.The campaigns use four Android surveillanceware tools - SilkBean, DoubleAgent, CarbonSteal, GoldenEagle, and DarthPusher.These tools are connected through shared infrastructure and code.The four malware families are part of a larger mAPT (mobile advanced persistent threat) operation that spans multiple years.While the main target appears to be the UYghur community, these tools have been used to target other groups, including Tibetans and other Tibetans.The first samples of DoubleAgent were found in 2019 and code points to development in 2017.Technical analysis of the malware shows it was likely developed by the same group.The other two malware families were likely developed separately but shared code.Analysis of the code links the four malware groups together, suggesting a shared code origin.The targeting of Tibetans is consistent with Chinese security efforts to counter terrorism.Lookout found evidence of at least 14 of the 26 countries being targeted by the malware campaigns discussed in this report.The targeted countries align with China's national security directives and ""counter-terrorism"" efforts as defined by the Chinese government.Indicators of compromise found in the malware indicate compromise by Chinese state-sponsored actors.The report recommends security measures to detect and defend against these types of mobile threats.In summary, the report uncovers a collection of long-running Android malware campaigns by Chinese mAPTs using surveillanceware to target the U Yghur group and other groups.","The PDF report details mobile surveillance campaigns targeting Uyghurs using Android malware tools.It was written by security researchers at Lookout in June 2020.The report focuses on four interconnected Android surveillanceware tools - SilkBean, DoubleAgent, CarbonSteal, and GoldenEagle - which have been used in long-running campaigns against Uyghurs since at least 2013.SilkBean is a small but sophisticated remote access trojan (RAT) used to target Uyghurs.It has been active since at least 2015.SilkBean shares infrastructure links with other malware like DarthPusher, HenBox, and PluginPhantom, suggesting the same group is behind these tools.DoubleAgent is an advanced Android RAT used against groups with contentious relationships with China, like Tibetans.It has spying capabilities and first appeared in 2013.New DoubleAgent samples from 2019 show continued development and targeting of Uyghurs.CarbonSteal is Android spyware tracked since 2017, focused on audio surveillance.It has infrastructure links to HenBox malware and shares certificates with DoubleAgent, DarthPusher, and other tools, again pointing to the same coordinated group.GoldenEagle is Android spyware potentially dating back to 2012.It impersonates a wide array of apps and has sophisticated data exfiltration capabilities.Links have been found between GoldenEagle, CarbonSteal, and other tools.In total, the report details a long-running, sophisticated mobile spying campaign primarily targeting the Uyghur community globally.The shared infrastructure and code links between the four malware families indicate the same Chinese state-sponsored advanced persistent threat actor is coordinating these efforts."
"ESET research discovered a new cyberattack called SwiftSlicer deployed by attackers using Active Directory Group Policy and Go language to deploy a new wiper.The wiper deletes shadow copies, overwrites files located in %CSIDL_SYSTEM%\drivers, %CSIDSYSTEM_DRIVE%\Windows\NTDS and other non-system drives, and reboots the system.Once executed it uses 4096 bytes length blocks filled with randomly generated byte 2/3113446,700 to overwrit existing files.For overwriting files it uses a random 4096 byte block filled with 512 bytes.Detection names include WinGo/KillFiles.C trojan, which is a new malware variant of the WinGo trojan used in previous attacks.This attack is attributed to the Sandworm malware family, which has been observed targeting Ukraine since 2014.The malware uses shadow copies to delete files located on system drives.It overwrits files located elsewhere on the system and then reboots systems.The attack is thought to be related to previous Sandworm attacks.The new malware is written in Go and uses various obfuscation techniques to avoid detection.The attackers appear to be using Go as a scripting language.The report concludes that this attack demonstrates the sophistication of nation-state sponsored cybercrime.","On January 25th, 2023, ESET researchers discovered a new cyberattack deploying a wiper malware named SwiftSlicer in Ukraine.The attackers used Active Directory Group Policy to distribute the SwiftSlicer wiper, which is written in the Go programming language.ESET attributes this attack to the Sandworm threat actor group.Once executed, SwiftSlicer deletes shadow copies, recursively overwrites files in specific system folders like %CSIDL_SYSTEM%\drivers and %CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE%\Windows\NTDS, as well as files on non-system drives.It overwrites files using a 4,096 byte block filled with random bytes.After overwriting files, it reboots the computer.ESET provided the following indicators of compromise: - SHA256 hash: 7346E2E29FADDD63AE5C610C07ACAB46B2B1B176 - Detection names: WinGo/KillFiles.C trojan This analysis shows Sandworm has developed a new wiper malware named SwiftSlicer, written in Go, and deployed it in a cyberattack against Ukraine in January 2023.The wiper is designed to recursively overwrite critical system files and folders before rebooting the system to render it inoperable."
"The document describes a cyberattack by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups targeting organizations heavily targeted by a Chinese threat actor group.The attackers leveraged zero-day vulnerabilities in the Sophos Firewall to gain access and install a backdoor on the firewall.Volexity obtained memory, selective files, and disk images from the compromised system to conduct a forensic investigation.Analysis of the data led to the discovery of a backdoor and evidence of exploitation dating back to March 5, 2022.The attacker used man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks to conduct attacks against the victim organization's staff.These attacks aimed to further breach cloud-hosted web servers hosting the organization's public-facing websites.The attacks were attributed to a Chinese APT group known as ""DriftingCloud"" based on patterns of code execution and configuration details.The attack flow involved compromising the victim's website hosting PHP web servers to install PHP backdoor payloads like Pantegana, Sliver, and Sliver.Sliver is a custom backdoor that allows privilege escalation through exploitation of a vulnerability.It was installed by exploiting a vulnerability in the company's Firewall API.It communicates with command and control servers via IP address spoofing to gain initial access and persistence.It can be used to install additional payloads from the attacker's dropper payloads.In summary, the report provides technical details on the attack flow, techniques, and steps to detect and defend against similar attacks like this one by analyzing the compromised Sophos firewall.Recommendations include monitoring for similar compromises in your network and using threat intelligence to identify and respond in kind.The report aims to inform defenses against this type of attack.","The PDF describes research by Volexity into a sophisticated cyberattack campaign targeting organizations of interest to Chinese threat actors.The attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Sophos firewall devices to gain initial access.Volexity detected the intrusion through anomaly detection and forensic investigation of the compromised firewall.The attackers had installed a malicious Java class file to create a backdoor on the firewall's web interface.This provided persistent access using the publicly available BEHINDER webshell framework.The attackers then performed man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept credentials and cookies for externally hosted websites belonging to the victim organization.They leveraged the stolen cookies to remotely access the website's admin console and install PHP webshells for further access.Web server compromise was used to install backdoors like PupyRAT, Pantegana, and Sliver.Privilege escalation attempts were also observed.The campaign exhibits sophistication through exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability, custom webshells, and operational security measures.Volexity attributes the activity to a Chinese threat actor group they track as DriftingCloud based on TTPs.The incident highlights risks of gateway device compromise and need for network monitoring to detect advanced persistent threat activity.Recommendations are provided for detection and prevention of similar attacks.In summary, the report analyzes an advanced cyberespionage campaign that combined a firewall zero-day exploit with strategic web server compromises to gain access and persist within a targeted organization's network."
"The document analyzes a recent North Korean malware campaign targeting the Mac OS X operating system by the Lazarus Group, also known as APT38.The first stage of the malware is the backdoor Esilet, distributed via a trojanized Electron app that uses JavaScript and HTML5 for initial infection.Next is a launch agent called Nukesped that communicates with command and control servers to collect system info.It can execute arbitrary commands, upload files, take screenshots, and more.The malware uses tools like KnockKnock, BlockBlock, and LuLu to persist on the victim's system.It is distributed via social engineering to gain initial access and can then conduct follow-on activities like stealing private keys or exploiting security gaps.Esilet claims to offer live cryptocurrency prices and price predictions.It leverages the tools and techniques outlined in the malware for persistence.The report concludes that Esilet is the latest in a long line of malware targeting the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors by North Korean state-sponsored actors.The targeting of the sector shows North Korea's continued interest in both cryptocurrency and government-sponsored cyber espionage.","The blog post analyzes a recent macOS malware sample called NukeSped distributed by the North Korean Lazarus Group.It is delivered in two stages - first via a trojanized cryptocurrency app, then by downloading the backdoor NukeSped.The initial app Esilet uses an Electron framework and JavaScript to check for updates which downloads the next stage malware.NukeSped persists as a launch agent and uses libcurl networking APIs to communicate with command and control servers.Analysis of NukeSped shows it is a full-featured backdoor capable of surveying the system, executing arbitrary commands, reading/writing files, and more based on commands from the C2 server.The author demonstrates how existing macOS security tools like KnockKnock, BlockBlock, and LuLu detect the malware's behaviors like persistence and network connections even without prior knowledge of this new threat.The tools provide effective heuristic detection and can block the malware."
"The document analyzes two recent cyber espionage campaigns targeting organizations in Taiwan by a threat actor group called Tropic Trooper that has been active since at least 2011.The attacks targeted government and energy companies located in Taiwan.One campaign sent spear phishing emails spoofing the Taiwanese government to the Secretary General of Taiwan's Executive Yuan.The emails exploited CVE-2012-0158, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that allows remote code execution.The decoy document was a spreadsheet titled ""example"" that contained links to pro-democracy protests and political movements.The overarching theme of the spreadsheet suggests it was compiled by progressive supporters.It documented protest activity and progressive reforms.The second campaign targeted an energy company also based in Taiwan using the Poison Ivy RAT malware.This suggests the group is using Poison Ivy as part of their toolkit, something previously speculated but not conclusively stated.Analysis uncovered ties to the group's known malware like Yahoyah and Poison Ivy to the PCShare malware used in the other campaign.This indicates the group uses both for espionage and infrastructure development.Tactics, techniques, and infrastructure links point to a focus on Taiwan's strategic location in the disputed South China Sea region and emerging economy.Tactics and techniques are discussed along with possible motivations for targeting Taiwan, including sovereignty concerns, emerging economies, and high-tech sector growth.Recommendations include blocking known vulnerabilities and leveraging threat intelligence to detect and defend against such attacks.In summary, the report provides an in-depth analysis of two recent campaigns by a suspected Chinese state-sponsored cyberespionage group targeting Taiwanese organizations using malware and social engineering techniques.It reveals a sophisticated, resourceful threat actor with long-standing ties to Taiwan.","The report from Palo Alto Networks details attacks by a threat actor group called Tropic Trooper, which has been active since at least 2011 targeting organizations in Taiwan and other Asia Pacific countries.Tropic Trooper typically uses spearphishing emails containing exploits to deliver malware like Yahoyah.The report confirms they also use Poison Ivy and possibly PCShare malware.In August 2016, Tropic Trooper targeted Taiwan's Executive Yuan government office and a fossil fuel company with spearphishing using weaponized Office documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158.The malware payload was Poison Ivy configured to communicate with command and control servers typically hacked third party systems.The decoy document contained content related to Taiwanese political and activist movements.Infrastructure analysis uncovered ties between Yahoyah, Poison Ivy, and PCShare malware used by Tropic Trooper.The group actively maintains and reuses malware and exploits over time.Tropic Trooper appears to be a persistent, organized threat group focused on targets in Taiwan and the Asia Pacific region.Their tactics rely on social engineering and known exploits rather than zero-days.Protection measures against Tropic Trooper include blocking their infrastructure, preventing Office exploit delivery, behavioral analysis to detect malware execution, and other threat prevention techniques."

"The document analyzes a targeted attack campaign called Operation GreedyWonk that compromised multiple websites focused on national security and foreign policy.Visitors were redirected to an exploit server hosting a zero-day Flash exploit exploiting a CVE-2014-0502 vulnerability.The exploit bypasses Windows' Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protections on Windows XP, Windows 7, Java, and Microsoft Office 2007/2010.It also exploits the Kaba vulnerability in Kaba.This campaign appears to be related to a May 2012 campaign outlined by ShadowServer based on tradecraft, infrastructure, and domain registration details.The group appears to have sufficient resources and a determination to infect foreign and defense-related websites for follow-on data theft.Mitigations include updating to latest versions of Office and Java, patching ASLR, and updating Java if it is older than 1.6.This mitigations do not patch the underlying vulnerability, but they prevent the exploit from functioning in the wild.The attack uses only known ASLR bypasses, bypassing other known vulnerabilities like HXDS.DLL and MSVCR71.dll for Windows XP and Java if the user has Java 1.7 or older.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at the tactics, techniques, and infrastructure used in this latest Flash exploit campaign, along with recommendations for mitigating the threat through security updates and updated Office.","The document describes an attack campaign dubbed ""Operation GreedyWonk"" that was discovered in February 2014.The campaign involved compromising multiple websites related to economic policy, foreign affairs, and national security.Visitors to these compromised sites were redirected to an exploit server hosting a zero-day Flash exploit (CVE-2014-0502).The goal was to infect visitors, especially those interested in defense and public policy matters, with malware for follow-on data theft.The exploit bypassed Windows ASLR protections by targeting systems still running Windows XP or having outdated Java and Microsoft Office.Once the exploit succeeded, it installed a remote access trojan called PlugX/Kaba.This malware variant was compiled shortly before discovery, indicating it was specifically built for this campaign.Researchers believe GreedyWonk may be connected to an earlier 2012 campaign that used similar tradecraft and infrastructure.Malware samples from both campaigns connected to overlapping domains that previously resolved to the same IP addresses.The group behind the campaigns appears sufficiently resourced to access zero-days and remains a credible threat.The report highlights the actor's persistence in compromising policy and defense-related websites, early access to exploits, ability to re-compromise sites, and deployment of various malware families.This demonstrates an adversary with mature capabilities that continues to pose a threat through strategic web compromises to infect visitors from specific communities."
"The PDF describes a malware campaign by a threat actor group called Lazarus that distributed signed Mac malware disguised as legitimate software.The malware was uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil disguised as a job description for cryptocurrency firm Coinbase.It dropped a signed Mac executable disguised as the job description and dropped three files: a decoy PDF document, a bundle FinderFontsUpdater.app, and a downloader safarifontagent.app.The bundle is signed using a certificate issued in February 2022 to a developer named Shankey Nohria and team identifier 264HFWQH63.The application is not notarized and Apple has revoked the certificate on August 12.The Windows counterpart of this threat dropped the exact same decoy, but connected to a different C&C server.The downloader also connected to another server instead of the original one.Changes were made to the downloader as it connects to a new server and did not respond to previous requests for help from VirusTotal.Overall, the malware was compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon platforms and drops three files - a PDF, file bundle, and downloader.It is an instance of Operation In(ter)ception by Lazarus targeting Macs.The campaign appears to be ongoing, with Lazarus distributing Mac malware on both sides of the Mac OSX/iOS divide.","ESET researchers discovered a new malware campaign targeting Mac users that is attributed to the Lazarus threat group.On August 16, 2022, ESET announced on Twitter that a signed Mac executable disguised as a Coinbase job description was uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil.This is similar to a campaign ESET uncovered in May 2022 originating from Singapore.The malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures.It drops three files: a PDF job description decoy, a bundle called FinderFontsUpdater.app, and a downloader called safarifontagent.The bundle is signed with a certificate issued in February 2022 that Apple revoked on August 12, 2022.Unlike the May campaign, this version connects to a different command and control server at concrecapital[.]com.The server did not respond when analyzed.On August 4, 2022, another security researcher found a Windows version dropping the same PDF and connecting to a different C2.ESET believes this new activity is part of Lazarus' Operation In(ter)ception campaign targeting Mac users.The malware bypasses security products by disguising itself as a legitimate job application.The use of code signing and targeting of cryptocurrency companies indicates the likely purpose is cyberespionage and financial theft.ESET provided hashes for the dropped files and C2 domain to help identify infections.They assess this demonstrates Lazarus' continued efforts to breach MacOS devices through social engineering and Trojanized applications."
"The document analyzes malware samples submitted to threat intelligence services like Talos and Aurora.It aims to connect the dots between malware samples and attribution based on the timestamps of when they were initially submitted.Analysis of the Talos samples shows that some malware authors directly interacted with the sandbox during the development phase of the threats.This suggests the malware authors may have been using the sandbox for months or years before attribution.Some of the APT campaigns in the analysis were attributed to Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns, but the malware samples were mislabeled and not properly associated with APTs.The analysis shows that detection of an APT campaign can take months if not years based on mislabeling and misidentification of malware samples.The report concludes that attribution is key to detecting and stopping persistent threats.It recommends organizations use threat intelligence tools like VirusTotal, Aurora, and Talos to detect and block possible links between the Cisco and Cisco AMP solutions.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at malware development and attribution using the tools and techniques proposed in a 2015 USENIX Security 2015 paper.It highlights the challenges of connecting the dots and drawing relationships between samples and campaigns that take months and many experts to uncover.","The PDF is a blog post by Cisco Talos describing their analysis of past APT malware campaigns in their threat intelligence datasets.They looked at 10 major APT campaigns made public between 2010-2015, including campaigns like Aurora, Equation, Red October etc.Attribution is not discussed.They searched for these malware samples in the Talos malware zoo (feeds from AV companies, researchers etc.)and found samples for most campaigns existed in their zoo months or years before public disclosure of the APT campaigns.On average, it took 458 days after initial detection for samples to be publicly tied to an APT campaign.The gap was as high as 3 years for Equation samples.Analysis of VirusTotal submitters showed certain entities had submitted samples from multiple campaigns, indicating possible links between campaigns or actors.In the Cisco AMP customer telemetry, they found pre-dated samples related to 3 campaigns.Most were detected as malicious when first seen, but some evaded initial detection.The post concludes that while detection happens quickly, connecting samples to campaigns takes longer due to high volumes of generic malware.Sandbox evasion also delays detection.Their findings validate that threat actors submit samples to test defenses prior to attacks.Better analytics are needed to identify and correlate samples early to discover stealthy campaigns in progress."
"The document analyzes the cybersecurity trends and threats observed in ransomware in 2017 compared to 2016.It reveals that the number of new ransomware families rose 32 percent from 2016 to 327 in 2017.However, the ransomware-related threats detected by the Trend Micro Smart Protection Network (SPN) went in the opposite direction and dipped 41 percent.This suggests that only a select few of these new families actually made an impact in 2017, while many old ransomware families still affect users worldwide.Ransomware brings about bigger global outbreaks despite fewer major players, with WannaCry and Petya causing billions of dollars in damage.Known vulnerabilities like EternalBlue and EternalRomance were exploited for ransomware campaigns.Business email compromise (BEC) also increased significantly in the second half of 2017 over the first half.BEC is still a major threat despite cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin increasing value.Cybercriminals reworked old techniques to take advantage of the crypto-trends and exploited known vulnerabilities in new ways.Overall threats like ransomware, data theft, and data breaches are expected to rise as cryptocurrency values rise.Security solutions like behavior monitoring and application control are needed to detect and respond to evolving threats.The report emphasizes the need for multi-layered solutions like security solutions, behavior monitoring, application control, and threat intelligence to detect, defend against, and mitigate against evolving threats across the ransomware spectrum.","The document provides an overview of major cybersecurity threats and trends in 2017 compared to 2016.Ransomware continued to be a major threat, with more new families emerging but fewer large-scale attacks than 2016.Major outbreaks like WannaCry and Petya caused more damage globally than typical ransomware.Known vulnerabilities like EternalBlue were exploited for ransomware campaigns.Business email compromise scams also increased significantly, doubling in the second half of 2017 compared to the first half.Cryptocurrency became a big target for cybercriminals as bitcoin valuations skyrocketed.They used social engineering and evolved old ransomware to steal cryptocurrency.Coin mining malware also emerged to abuse the rise in cryptocurrencies.Overall threats blocked by Trend Micro dropped from 2016, indicating a shift from broad attacks to more targeted ones.But data breaches disclosed affected even more records, including major breaches at Yahoo.The report highlights key threats like ransomware, business email compromise scams, cryptocurrency abuse, and data breaches.It notes the shift from broad spam campaigns to more targeted attacks.It advises using security solutions with capabilities like machine learning, behavior monitoring, and application control to detect latest threats."

"The PDF describes the use of the RGDoor backdoor by threat actors to gain access to compromised Middle Eastern web servers.While investigating a TwoFace vulnerability, researchers discovered actors installing an Internet Information Services (IIS) backdoor that we callRGDoor on targets in the Middle East.Unlike TwoFace, which allows users to interact with compromised web servers via a web browser, the RGRig backdoor allows interaction via HTTP.It collects all HTTP POST requests, commands, cookies, and data from the web server.It is compiled into a DLL and loaded into the IIS server via the command line.The DLL has an exported function named ""RegisterModule"" that indicates it is a custom native code HTTP module that the threat actor would load into IIS.The fact that it is an IIS HTTP module suggests there is no visual representation of the shell for actors to interact.This makes it harder for them to detect and remove the TwoFace shell if they try.In summary, the PDF provides an in-depth look at the use and deployment of RGRigs by Middle Eastern actors to compromise and exfiltrate data from compromised websites.It reveals the sophisticated techniques used by the threat actors, infrastructure, and logs used to deploy the backdoor, as well as their contingency plans.The report aims to inform defenders on how to detect, defend against, and respond to such intrusions using tools and techniques.","The document describes a backdoor named RGDoor used by a threat actor group called OilRig to maintain access to compromised servers, primarily in the Middle East region.OilRig initially infects servers using a web shell called TwoFace.To have a backup method of access if TwoFace is detected and removed, they also install the RGDoor backdoor module into the IIS web server.RGDoor is stealthier as it does not present a visual web interface like TwoFace.It is installed via IIS configuration and checks all HTTP POST requests for commands encrypted in cookie data.Available commands allow uploading/downloading files and running shell commands.RGDoor provides a more discreet and robust backup access mechanism if the TwoFace web shell is remediated on a compromised server.The report found RGDoor installed on web servers belonging to Middle Eastern government, financial, and educational organizations.Specific details are provided on RGDoor's encryption scheme, command structure, and how it interacts with the IIS server.Recommendations are made to monitor IIS logs for telltale RGDoor cookie values.The report concludes that OilRig has contingency plans to regain access, suggesting persistence is a priority for their operations.Defenses against RGDoor are available in various Palo Alto Networks products and services."
"The document analyzes a new backdoor called skip-2.0 discovered by ESET that targets Microsoft SQL (MSSQL) servers.It is the first publicly documented MSSQL backdoor documented publicly targeting Microsoft SQL servers since at least 2012.The attacker can connect stealthily to any MssQL account by using a magic password to hide connections from the logs.This allows them to steal data and manipulate in-game currencies for financial gain.The malware uses a custom VMProtected launcher and custom packer to drop the PortReuse and ShadowPad backdoor payloads.It uses an injector called Inner-Loader for sqlserv.exe to inject an encrypted backdoor payload.The payload encryption is the same as other Winnti Group tools.The hooks are similar to those used for persistence and persistence via DLL hijacking.Compromise of MSSql Servers 11 and 12 shows multiple similarities to the Port Reuse backdoor.This suggests the group may be using a combination of these two backdoors for persistence.The report provides technical details on the technical details and functionality of skip.2-0, as well as exposing the technical similarities with other tools used by the group.It aims to raise awareness of the threat posed by this new, undetected SQL backdoor.The group is known for conducting supply chain attacks against the video game and software industry.","The document describes analysis of a new backdoor called skip-2.0 used by the Winnti cyberespionage group to target Microsoft SQL Server.Winnti has been active since at least 2012 conducting supply chain attacks against the video game and software industries.Skip-2.0 allows the attacker to stealthily connect to any MSSQL account using a hardcoded magic password.It achieves this by installing hooks in the sqllang.dll library used by MSSQL Server to bypass authentication and disable logging of the unauthorized access.The malware uses the same VMProtected launcher, custom packer, and injector techniques seen in other Winnti tools like PortReuse and ShadowPad.An injector called Inner-Loader injects the skip-2.0 DLL into the sqlserv.exe process.Skip-2.0 locates and hooks functions in sqllang.dll related to password validation, logging, and auditing using pattern matching.If the magic password is provided, the hooks spoof validation and disable logging.This gives Winnti stealthy persistence and access to manipulate or steal data from compromised MSSQL Servers.Skip-2.0 was found to be effective against MSSQL Server versions 11 and 12.The malware shares multiple similarities with other Winnti tools, leading researchers to attribute it to their arsenal for targeted cyberespionage campaigns.Defenses like monitoring for anomalies and enforcing certificate validation are recommended."
"The document analyzes the activities of the threat actor TA505, also known as ""FlawedGrace"" and ""GraceWire"".TA505 is an independent threat actor that evolved from a partnership with EvilCorp to conduct cybercrime operations after initially focusing on banking fraud.In 2017, TA505 shifted towards ransomware operations and started using custom tools like Clop and ""ServBBot"" alongside existing tools like Ammyy Admin and RMS/RUT.NCC Group tracked a peer-to-peer (P2P) network related to TA505 by analyzing binary files that communicate with each other via UDP.The binary files are downloaded along with other Necurs components (signed drivers, block lists) P2P binary files transfer certain information (records) between nodes based on the network IDs of the identified samples.The nodes communicate via UDP and XC and the node XC communicates with the command and control server.The programming style and dropped file formats match the development standards of the malware used by TA505.The downloader communicates with a command server to retrieve system information and send it to the attacker's command server.This avoids detection by using machine learning or sandboxing.The components match the components used in ransomware operations.The report concludes that TA505 has realised the potential of ransomware operations as a viable business model and can extort large sums of money from victims.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at the evolution of TA505's operations, tools, and malware over several years, revealing the group's focus on cybercrime, ransomware, and evolving tactics.to target corporate networks.","The PDF describes research by NCC Group tracking a peer-to-peer (P2P) network used by the threat actor TA505, known for distribution of banking trojans and ransomware.The P2P network includes a downloader, signed driver, and node tool that communicate via UDP.The node tool exchanges records between peers.The programming style matches that of the GraceRAT malware used by TA505.The downloader fetches the other components from a command and control server, decrypts them, and installs them.The signed driver filters system information to avoid detection, injects the node tool payload, and reports back to the C2.The node tool communicates with other peers to exchange records containing metadata and encrypted payloads.The records appear to be used to distribute updates.While no interaction with GraceRAT was observed, the attribution to GraceRAT developers is based on code similarities.The research provides indicators of compromise on the components and notes that TA505 has shifted focus to ransomware operations for financial gain.The P2P network allows TA505 to distribute tools and updates while avoiding centralized infrastructure that could be taken down.The tools evolve but TA505 continues to pose a threat by compromising corporate networks."
"The document analyzes the Tildeb malware implant, a remote access trojan (RAT) that infects Windows systems when executed.It is compiled as a console Windows executable and accepts command-line arguments.The implant has the following file characteristics: File name: clocksvc.exe Compilation timestamp: October 3, 2000 - 21:01:55.File size: 57344 bytes.It has been 18 years since the implant was compiled, but it’s possible that it may have been created earlier considering the time it took to develop and the number of iterations.The code is not obfuscated in any way and thus has no anti-disassembly or anti-debugging features.It uses encrypted strings and similar obfuscation techniques to avoid detection.The infection vector is not directly related to other files in the leak since it is positioned as a stand-alone implant.However, the database table ""ProcessInformation"" contains process names that map to known exploitation frameworks like UNITEDRAKE, MOSSFERN, EXPANDINGPULLY, GROK, FOGGYBOTTOM, MORBIDANGEL, and others.This suggests the implant may be used in conjunction with other tools for exploitation.The report provides technical details on how the malware functions, including the main executable, command line options, encryption, TCP ports, command and control commands, registry entries, and more.It examines how the infection vector affects the Exchange Server processes and the implant's behavior.The main executable communicates with the command line via a Cleanup Thread.This allows the implant to inject code into the process and clean up the infected system if it detects a vulnerability.After checking for command line arguments, the process will sleep for 4.09 seconds to enable code injection into the registry.This is followed by setting global variables to set a global variable to 1 to 1.The registry entry points to a mailslot for the Exchange server processes.Cleanup threads check for vulnerabilities like win32k.sys and check for failures to connect over TCP/TLS.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at the inner workings of a remote code execution trojan used by an unknown threat actor to infect and exploit Windows systems.It reveals a sophisticated, evolving RAT that has evolved over many years to evade detection and evade analysis.The RAT malware is an evolving, evolving threat that continues evolving with new tools and techniques.","The report provides an analysis of the Tildeb malware implant leaked by the Shadow Brokers.Tildeb is a console-based Windows executable compiled in 2000 that accepts command-line arguments.It has no encryption, anti-debugging or persistence mechanisms.Tildeb establishes encrypted TCP communications with a hardcoded command and control server to receive control commands.It can upload and delete files, get directory listings, modify the registry, communicate via mailslots, and inject code into the Exchange Server processes.The implant creates a cleanup thread to remove artifacts if connections fail.It attempts privilege escalation against specific Windows versions using a win32k.sys vulnerability.Tildeb tailors some actions based on the infected system's locale.The report examines Tildeb's command and control communications in depth, including the key exchange, control commands supported, error reporting, and mailslot messaging formats.It analyzes the process hollowing code injection technique employed.There are indications Tildeb may be delivered via spearphishing or run in conjunction with an exploitation framework.The compile timestamp suggests development prior to 2000, but it may have undergone iterations.While the exact targets are unknown, the Exchange Server interactions imply compromise of email environments."
"The PDF describes attacks using the golddragon/braveprince malware group, part of the kimsuky (aka Thallium) group, recently discovered by Cisco Talos.This malware group is known for stealing sensitive information via spear phishing emails.Recent attacks have added a routine to encode API names into the malware to decrypt it and other Quasar RAT-based.net malware.The malware uses a name en/decoding routine to encrypt/decrypt DLL and API names received as arguments.It creates a string substitution key table containing the encoded DLL name and API name table.The decryption logic is implemented by using the index of the character position in the key table to decrypt the API names.The string substitution is also found in other malware used by this group.The main purpose of the malware is to steal system info.It communicates with command and control servers to send it to the attacker's network.The report analyzes the behavior of the braveprince, password stealer malware, and Quarsar RAT malware.It reveals how these three groups interact with each other and share code and infrastructure.It aims to identify and defend against such attacks by providing technical details on their infrastructure, techniques, and techniques.","The document analyzes recent activity by the North Korean threat actor group Kimsuky, also known as Golddragon or Braveprince.It first looks at malware from the Golddragon/Braveprince cluster that steals information and communicates with a command and control server.This malware now includes a routine to encode API names to evade detection.The second sample is an information stealer that gathers system data, account credentials from browsers, and exfiltrates the information.This appears to be a module used by other Kimsuky malware.The third sample leverages the open source Quasar RAT.It uses privilege escalation techniques to disable Windows Defender before dropping the RAT payload.This payload communicates with C2 servers and has code similarities to previous Kimsuky malware.In summary, the analysis examines three new malware samples attributed to the Kimsuky group based on code reuse, tactics, and other similarities to known activity.It highlights the ongoing evolution of their malware to gather data from compromised systems and communicate with command and control infrastructure."
"The document analyzes activity targeting French aerospace focused on exploiting CVE-2014-0322, a zero-day vulnerability in the Linux kernel that is now identified as the source of the recent Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) malware attack.The VFW attack leveraged exploit code for a zero day vulnerability to infect victims with ZxShell malware, but the malware variant Sakula connected to command-and-control infrastructure at oaameteksen.com instead of AURORA PANDA.Sakula malware contained an unusual component that connected to a command and control server hosted by the French aerospace company Safran.Safran is a France-based aerospace and defense company with a focus on the design and production of aircraft engines and equipment.The malware used domains linked to Safran subsidiary Snecma, which designs and builds engines for civilian and military aircraft.This attack shares similarities to 2012 SWC campaign targeting the website of U.S.-based Capstone Turbine, also focused on French aerospace, using zero-days and GIFAS as a focus.It is unclear why Sakula was used, but it could be to connect victims directly to C2 or for credential collection.In summary, the report analyzes recent strategic web compromise (SWC) activity leveraging vulnerabilities in Linux kernel to target French aerospace using malware delivered via malicious iframes from the GIFAS website, likely to gain access to employees and contractors.It sheds light on the motivation behind the targeting of French aerospace and suggests a desire to build trust.The report aims to inform defenses against such as patching vulnerabilities to prevent such targeted attacks in the future.","The document analyzes a cyberespionage campaign targeting the French aerospace industry in early 2014.The attackers exploited the CVE-2014-0322 vulnerability using a strategic web compromise to infect victims with Sakula malware.The malware and infrastructure showed connections to French aerospace companies like Safran.The attackers compromised a Safran subdomain and DNS records.The Sakula malware also modified hosts files to include internal Snecma domains.This attack shares tactics, techniques, and procedures with a 2012 campaign that compromised the website of US turbine manufacturer Capstone Turbine.Both used the Sakula malware, exploited zero-days, and involved domains referencing the French aerospace association GIFAS.While the victims are unknown, the indicators point to a focused campaign against French aerospace entities potentially for cyberespionage.The report highlights the importance of securing public-facing websites and DNS infrastructure against state-sponsored threats.Proactive monitoring for strategic web compromises and malware is recommended."
"The document describes an operation dubbed Operation Honeybee by McAfee Advanced Threat Research that targeted humanitarian aid organizations using malicious Word documents containing North Korean political lures to trick victims into opening Word documents.The malicious documents contain a Visual Basic macro that drops an upgraded version of the SYSCON backdoor, also known as ""Honeybee"".The campaign started in Vietnam in January 2018 and continues to target humanitarian groups there.The macros were authored by a Korean speaker and the malware uses a custom key to encode data.This key has been used since at least August 2017 in previous malware campaigns.The malware has persistence capabilities to persist on compromised systems and exfiltrate system data.It communicates with a command and control server and can download additional droppers from the cloud.The droppers use decoy documents with the same Visual Basic code and author name as Honeybee but do not contain speci c lures, instead using Word compatibility messages to entice victims to open them.One dropper is a Win32 executable that pretends to be a Word document based on its icon, but is actually a dropper for the same type of malware as observed with the other malicious documents.Another dropper uses a stolen digital signature from Adobe and is also used by another Korean-language program database (PDB) path.This suggests the authors did not check for UAC protections like Singapore, Argentina, Japan, Indonesia, Canada, and South Korean ports before sending the malware.The decoy droppers are signed by the cloud-based software company Xero as a possible code signing service.The targeting of humanitarian groups indicates a shift in tactics from traditional North Korean lures.McAfee antivirus targeting.The group ATT&CK is investigating the operation based on similarities in droppers, command servers, and droppers.","The document describes an operation called Operation Honeybee that was discovered by McAfee researchers.The operation involved a malicious document campaign targeting humanitarian aid groups.The malicious documents contained North Korean political themes as lures to get victims to open the documents.Once opened, the documents installed a malware backdoor called SYSCON on the victim's computer.Researchers found that the campaign heavily targeted victims in Vietnam in mid-January 2018.Analysis showed the documents were authored by a Korean speaker.The malware used unique encoding keys that matched previous SYSCON campaigns dating back to August 2017.The malware established persistence on systems and exfiltrated data like system info and running processes back to a command server.The malware variants used new droppers not seen before, indicating the threat actors created new tools specific for this campaign.The malware bypassed Windows UAC protections in its installation process.In addition to Vietnam, researchers saw targeting in South Korea, Singapore, Argentina, Japan, Indonesia, and Canada.The campaign specifically went after those involved in humanitarian aid and North/South Korean affairs.The report provides IOCs like file hashes, domain names, and MITRE ATT&CK techniques used by the malware.It concludes that this was a unique operation using custom malware to target a specific set of victims related to Korea issues and aid groups."
"The key analysis document analyzes the key components of the keylogging malware Sardonic and the related F5, which are believed to be used by the White Rabbit threat actor group FIN8.In December 2021, security firm Bitdefender published an article linking FIN8 to a previously unknown ransomware group called White Rabbit after observing similarities between their malware and Sardonic.Security firm Lodestone investigated and found strong similarities between the two malware families.Sardonic contains encryption and Gzip encryption, while F5 uses PowerShell and PowerShell DLLs.Some features of the F5 DLL have been removed, including the ability to kill existing processes, kill processes, and kill shellcode.Analysis of the PowerShell script shows it no longer has an option to kill an existing process and the decryption key is no longer stored in the.NET DLL.The PowerShell script uses a manual process instead of automation.The malware generates a 32-byte hardware ID based on the volume serial number serial number and hardware ID.The hardware ID and serial number are encrypted with a custom algorithm and placed into a 64-byte buffer before an attempt is made to connect to C2.If the malware is unable to reach the C2 server after five attempts, it will terminate itself and generate a random string that changes every time it attempts to terminate itself.If it does connect, it copies the system token and creates a child process that has system privileges to enable it to execute its own code with elevated privileges.The child process creates a PowerShell backdoor that fetches additional code from a command and control server.The parent process injects the malware into the attacker's C2 and connects to a remote shell.It communicates with the malware C2 to deploy the malware.Analysis shows the malware uses encryption, Gzip compression, and PowerShell scripting to avoid detection.The report concludes that the malware families are closely related and likely used by FIN8 and White Rabbit.Recommendations include security measures to detect and defend against this emerging threat.","Here is a summary of the key points from the report on the Sardonic and F5 malware used by the White Rabbit ransomware group: - White Rabbit is a ransomware group linked to the cybercrime group FIN8 in previous research.- Lodestone security researchers analyzed a new FIN8 backdoor called F5 that shows strong similarities to an earlier backdoor called Sardonic.- Both Sardonic and F5 use RC4 encryption for shellcode, gzip compression, and minor differences in decryption routines.F5 removed some features like process killing.- The PowerShell loader script downloads the backdoor DLL from a server using random URLs, likely indicating manual control by a human operator.- F5 checks for ""powershell.exe"" as the parent process, copies the LSASS access token, and connects to a C2 server after encrypting the system ID.- The White Rabbit ransomware itself is highly obfuscated, uses invalid certificates, and command line arguments to specify encryption parameters.It deletes itself after encrypting files.- Technical details, IP addresses, domains, filenames, YARA rules, and other IOCs are provided for detection of the malware and its C2 infrastructure.- The report examines the evolution of FIN8's malware arsenal from Sardonic to F5 based on code reuse and shared tactics, reinforcing the link between FIN8 and White Rabbit."
