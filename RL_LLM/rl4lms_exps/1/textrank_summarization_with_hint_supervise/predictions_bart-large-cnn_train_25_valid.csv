"Mandiant investigated a novel malware ecosystem impacting VMware ESXi hypervisors that allows persistent administrative access to the hypervisor.The malware allows the attacker to maintain control of ESXi systems, send commands to guest VM hosts, and execute arbitrary commands on Windows virtual machines hosted on ESXi.Mandiant analyzed ESXi boot profiles and identified two new malware families installed through malicious vSphere Installation Bundles (VIBs) called VIRTUALPITA and VIRTualPIE.The VIBs are available from partner supported and community supported partners.They contain the --force flag which sets a listener flag to receive arbitrary command execution requests.VIB payloads contain obfuscated Python scripts with similar capabilities as vmtoolsd.exe.One script is called UNC3886 and it exfiltrates compressed samples of itself and its payloads.Samples were also found on Linux vCenter systems running VirtUALGATE and VMCI, likely from China-based threat actors.While there is no evidence of a zero-day vulnerability, the malware shows state-sponsored actors are moving towards targeting ESXi as part of their cyberespionage toolkits.The report provides technical details on how the malware functions work, including the use of VIB files, loader scripts, and signature checks to detect VIB installs.It also covers detection methods to block the malware.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at an ESXi malware investigation by Mandiant into a novel, non-zero-day threat actor targeting of the virtual machine operating system using vSphere installation bundles to maintain persistence across multiple OSes.","The PDF document from Mandiant details the investigation of novel malware being deployed on VMware ESXi hypervisors by a threat actor tracked as UNC3886.The malware ecosystem enables persistent administrative access to the hypervisor, command execution on guest VMs, file transfers between the hypervisor and VMs, tampering with logs, and executing commands between VMs on the same hypervisor.The malware was initially detected when commands were seen coming from the vmtoolsd process on a Windows VM hosted on an ESXi hypervisor.Analysis of the ESXi boot profiles revealed malicious VIBs (vSphere Installation Bundles) being used to deploy backdoors called VIRTUALPITA and VIRTUALPIE on the hypervisors after reboot.The VIBs were signed as PartnerSupported though they were actually CommunitySupported, allowing installation with the --force flag.VIRTUALPITA creates a listener on the hypervisor for arbitrary command execution, file transfers, and starting/stopping logging.VIRTUALPIE is a Python backdoor with similar capabilities.Commands executed on the hypervisor are sent to guest VMs via vmtoolsd.exe for execution.This was used for file enumeration, compression, and credential dumping.VARIUALPITA samples were also found on Linux vCenter systems masquerading as a legitimate process.Windows VMs hosted on the compromised hypervisors contained VIRTUALGATE, a utility that uses VMCI sockets to run commands on guest VMs from the hypervisor.Based on the nature of the intrusions, Mandiant assesses UNC3886 has a likely China nexus and espionage motivations.Indicators of compromise, Yara rules, and recommendations for hardening ESXi/vSphere environments are provided."
"The report analyzes a malware campaign by the Fin7 cybercrime group called ""BadUSB"" that uses keystroke injection to install malware on USB devices trojanized using the Arduino microcontroller platform as a virtual keyboard.When a USB is maliciously used as a USB keyboard, the attack is called a ""keystroke injection"" or ""Rubber Ducky"" attack.The sketch sends keystrokes to a PowerShell script to execute and install the IceBot Remote Access Trojan (RAT) on the USB device.Analysis of the malware payloads identified 9 IP addresses that host FIN7's payloads and 3 FIN7 command-and-control servers, one of which contains a control panel for managing infected systems.IceBot RAT allows FIN7 to gain remote access to systems on compromised systems, bypassing OS and firewalls, and exfiltrating data from the network.The report provides in-depth analysis of the Arduino sketch file ""sketch_jul31a.ino,"" which contained the source code for the BadUSB malware.It demonstrates how hackers exploit the Arduino platform and its support for microcontrollers installed on USB to build malware-laden USB devices that emulate keyboards.The sketches connect to a command and control server to download additional payloads like IceBot and install it.The malware uses encryption, keylogging, and other techniques to evade detection.It can also evade detection by disabling security products like Firewalls and monitoring the network for signs of tampering with USB devices.Recommendations include encoding and decoding, sandboxing USBs, monitoring for malicious scripts and files, monitoring network traffic, and network segmentation, monitoring USB traffic for suspicious activity, and use of trojanizing USB devices, and monitoring for suspicious USB connections.","The cybercrime group FIN7 has been using ""BadUSB"" attacks to spread malware.They distribute USB devices containing malicious Arduino sketches that act as keyboards.When plugged in, the sketch executes PowerShell to download and install the IceBot remote access trojan (RAT).This allows FIN7 to gain unauthorized access to target networks.Analysis of the sketch code shows it opens a hidden PowerShell window to download the trojan from IP addresses linked to FIN7.The RAT then connects to FIN7 command and control servers.A control panel was discovered showing systems infected with IceBot, including info like IP, OS, antivirus, and options to interact with the RAT.This attack method avoids firewalls and email filters by not transmitting malware over the network.Encoding and scripts minimize malware files for stealth.FIN7 recently created a fake security company potentially to construct trojanized USBs.They may be using unwitting admins or sending them to clients for social engineering.The USB-based attack represents an evolution in tactics for FIN7 to gain persistent access and evade protections as they expand into ransomware operations.Defenses should focus on physical media controls and monitoring for suspicious USB activities."
"The document describes a targeted cyberattack campaign called Operation GreedyWonk that compromised websites focused on national security and foreign policy topics to redirect visitors to an exploit server hosting a Flash zero-day vulnerability.The attack leverages a previously unknown Flash CVE-2014-0502 vulnerability to bypass Windows' Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protections on Windows XP, Windows 7, Java 1.6, and Microsoft Office 2007-2010.Visitors to the websites of the Peterson Institute and Smith Richardson Foundation, which focus on defense and public policy matters, were redirected to the exploit server.The goal appears to be follow-on data theft, with the attackers likely targeting stolen data related to defense and policy matters.The exploit uses known ASLR bypasses to bypass protections on XP, Java, and Office 2007/2010.It does not patch the underlying Flash vulnerability, but by breaking the exploit's ASLR-bypass measures, it does prevent the current in-the-wild exploit from functioning.Mitigation recommendations include updating to latest versions of Java and Office, patching vulnerabilities in the exploit, and disabling virtual machine services like Kaba.The report concludes that this campaign demonstrates the sophisticated tradecraft, targeting, and resources of a threat actor based on similarities in techniques, infrastructure, and targeting of specific websites.The group behind this attack is a credible threat actor with resources to gain persistence and early access to target specific websites and malware families.","The document describes an attack campaign dubbed ""Operation GreedyWonk"" that was discovered in February 2014.The campaign involved compromising multiple websites related to economic policy, foreign affairs, and national security.Visitors to these compromised sites were redirected to an exploit server hosting a zero-day Flash exploit (CVE-2014-0502).The goal was to infect visitors, especially those interested in defense and public policy matters, with malware for follow-on data theft.The exploit bypassed Windows ASLR protections by targeting systems still running Windows XP or having outdated Java and Microsoft Office.Once the exploit succeeded, it installed a remote access trojan called PlugX/Kaba.This malware variant was compiled shortly before discovery, indicating it was specifically built for this campaign.Researchers believe GreedyWonk may be connected to an earlier 2012 campaign that used similar tradecraft and infrastructure.Malware samples from both campaigns connected to overlapping domains that previously resolved to the same IP addresses.The group behind the campaigns appears sufficiently resourced to access zero-days and remains a credible threat.The report highlights the actor's persistence in compromising policy and defense-related websites, early access to exploits, ability to re-compromise sites, and deployment of various malware families.This demonstrates an adversary with mature capabilities that continues to pose a threat through strategic web compromises to infect visitors from specific communities."
"The PDF describes a malware campaign called Operation Inception by Lazarus targeting Mac computers.On August 16, 2022, a signed executable disguised as a job description for cryptocurrency company Coinbase was uploaded to VirusTotal by a threat actor from Brazil.The executable is signed using a certificate issued in February 2022 to a developer named Shankey Nohria.It connects to a different C&C server and uses a different downloader called safarifontagent.app.The bundle contains three files - a PDF decoy, a bundle FinderFontsUpdater.app, and a downloader.Safari.app - which is signed with a certificate from February 2022 but revoked on August 12.A Windows version of the malware was also found, showing it was also part of the Mac campaign.The Windows malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon and drops three files: a decoy PDF document titled Coinbase_online_careers_2022_07.pdf.It is similar to a Windows malware discovery by ESETResearch in May 2022.The PDF is titled ""Engineering Manager, Product Security"" and refers to the job description of a ""Coinbase engineer"" at the company.ESETRAP detected the Windows malware on August 4, 2022.This suggests the Mac malware may also be from Lazarus.","ESET researchers discovered a new malware campaign targeting Mac users that is attributed to the Lazarus threat group.On August 16, 2022, ESET announced on Twitter that a signed Mac executable disguised as a Coinbase job description was uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil.This is similar to a campaign ESET uncovered in May 2022 originating from Singapore.The malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures.It drops three files: a PDF job description decoy, a bundle called FinderFontsUpdater.app, and a downloader called safarifontagent.The bundle is signed with a certificate issued in February 2022 that Apple revoked on August 12, 2022.Unlike the May campaign, this version connects to a different command and control server at concrecapital[.]com.The server did not respond when analyzed.On August 4, 2022, another security researcher found a Windows version dropping the same PDF and connecting to a different C2.ESET believes this new activity is part of Lazarus' Operation In(ter)ception campaign targeting Mac users.The malware bypasses security products by disguising itself as a legitimate job application.The use of code signing and targeting of cryptocurrency companies indicates the likely purpose is cyberespionage and financial theft.ESET provided hashes for the dropped files and C2 domain to help identify infections.They assess this demonstrates Lazarus' continued efforts to breach MacOS devices through social engineering and Trojanized applications."
"The document analyzes malware samples submitted to the Talos malware analysis platform Anubis.Anubis is a cloud-based platform used by Talos to analyze malware samples from various companies and researchers.Analysis of the Anubis sandbox revealed that some malware samples were submitted months before attribution to advanced persistent threat (APT) groups.This suggests the malware authors interacted with the sandbox during development, potentially leading to months-long waits before attribution.The APT campaigns examined span 6 years, with some spanning 458 days before detection.Some samples were mislabeled as legitimate malware and attributed to an APT campaign based on VirusTotal IP addresses.The analysis uncovered possible links between the malware samples and the Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) telemetry used to detect malware.The report concludes that attribution is difficult to make based on incomplete evidence.Talos aims to improve detection and attribution of APT malware by using machine learning and advanced threat intelligence to uncover new threats before public disclosure.","The PDF is a blog post by Cisco Talos describing their analysis of past APT malware campaigns in their threat intelligence datasets.They looked at 10 major APT campaigns made public between 2010-2015, including campaigns like Aurora, Equation, Red October etc.Attribution is not discussed.They searched for these malware samples in the Talos malware zoo (feeds from AV companies, researchers etc.)and found samples for most campaigns existed in their zoo months or years before public disclosure of the APT campaigns.On average, it took 458 days after initial detection for samples to be publicly tied to an APT campaign.The gap was as high as 3 years for Equation samples.Analysis of VirusTotal submitters showed certain entities had submitted samples from multiple campaigns, indicating possible links between campaigns or actors.In the Cisco AMP customer telemetry, they found pre-dated samples related to 3 campaigns.Most were detected as malicious when first seen, but some evaded initial detection.The post concludes that while detection happens quickly, connecting samples to campaigns takes longer due to high volumes of generic malware.Sandbox evasion also delays detection.Their findings validate that threat actors submit samples to test defenses prior to attacks.Better analytics are needed to identify and correlate samples early to discover stealthy campaigns in progress."

"Mandiant assesses with high confidence that APT42 is an Iranian state-sponsored cyber espionage group that has been active since at least 2015.Mandiant estimates with moderate confidence that the group operates on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) intelligence organization IRGC-IO.The group conducts highly targeted spear phishing campaigns to gain access to email accounts and mobile devices of individuals and organizations of interest to Iran, including government officials, journalists, academics, dissidents, and diaspora groups.Once inside a target's account, the group deploys Android malware to track locations, monitor communications, steal SMS messages, take videos and images, and exfiltrate data.The campaign emphasizes building trust with targets before attempting to steal credentials through crafted links or emails.Overlaps with other Iranian groups like APT37, APT39, and APT40 are drawn based on targeting patterns that align with IRGC intelligence priorities.Custom malware tools and GitHub repositories are also used.APT38 is believed to be affiliated with the group based on tactics, infrastructure, and targeting patterns.The report concludes with predictions of continued state sponsorship of cyber espionage against the Iranian government and its allies.","Here is a summary of the key points from the Mandiant report on the Iranian state-sponsored hacking group APT42: APT42 is a prolific Iranian cyber espionage group active since at least 2015.Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence they operate on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).The group relies on highly targeted spear phishing to compromise accounts and mobile devices of individuals and organizations of interest to Iran.This includes government officials, journalists, academics, and dissidents.Once compromised, APT42 has deployed Android malware capable of location tracking, recording communications, and stealing SMS messages and images.APT42 focuses on building trust with targets before sending credential harvesting links or attachments.They often impersonate journalists over weeks before acting maliciously.The group has consistently targeted Western think tanks, the Iranian diaspora, and the personal accounts of government officials.Their targeting aligns with Iranian intelligence priorities.APT42 uses a range of custom malware in operations, including backdoors, keyloggers, and Android surveillance tools.Some tools reuse code from public GitHub repositories.The report provides technical details on APT42's tactics, known malware, infrastructure, targeting, and attributes them with high confidence to the Iranian government based on strategic alignment."
"The document analyzes malware used in recent cyber attacks attributed to the threat actor group Lazarus to target financial institutions in Poland.Initial analysis of the malware links it to previous campaigns by the group targeting Polish banks using watering hole exploits.Three samples of malware linked to Lazarus were found, all submitted from Poland in recent weeks.Analysis of the fdsvc.exe executable shows it is an encrypted configuration file that decrypts and injects a backdoor DLL into a process or explorer.exe.Once loaded, it injects the backdoor into the process and communicates with a command and control server.Once connected, it uses Russian words to indicate the state of its operations or issue commands.The malware uses a false flag technique to hide its origin, registering itself as a bot based on the attack chain and using exploits to inject itself into shell processes.Similar techniques were used in the niebezpiecznik.pl exploit, which spoofed the attack by using a different false flag to inject a shell script instead of a legitimate one.The analysis sheds light on the use of Russian words in the malware, which indicates the group's intent to evade detection.Recommendations are made for detecting and blocking this new wave of attacks by the Lazarus group.","The document analyzes malware used in watering hole attacks on financial institutions attributed to the Lazarus cybercrime group.The malware uses false flags and misleading translations to disguise its origin and evade detection.The attacks start by compromising websites to serve exploits that download malware.The malware stages use encoded shellcode and downloading of components to complicate analysis.Decoding reveals loosely translated Russian words likely meant to mislead investigators into thinking the malware is from Russia.The multi-stage process ultimately leads to execution of unknown final payloads on target systems.The false flags and evolving techniques aim to avoid detection, but in-depth analysis enables attribution and highlights the need for continued monitoring of Lazarus campaigns.Defensive recommendations include implementing provided indicators of compromise."
"The document analyzes two waves of cyberattacks targeting Albanian government e-services that used ransomware and wiper malware signed with stolen certificates.The first wave occurred in July 2022 and targeted Albania's TIMS, ADAM, and MEMEX e-systems, targeting government and law enforcement systems critical for law enforcement.The malware was similar to the first wave but with modifications to evade detection and evasion, including embedding a raw disk driver, providing direct disk access in the malware, modifying metadata, and using a leaked code signing certificate from Nvidia to sign the malware.The second wave started with a remote access trojanized AnyDesk account at a non-governmental entity, suggesting cooperation between different attack groups.Suggestions were made for Persian-speaking hackers to use the account to deploy ransomware/wiper malware, reminiscent of the Shamoon wiper attacks in the Middle East.The ransomware samples used the use of CreateFile, WriteFile APIs, and RC4 to bypass security checks and evade detection.The ransom notes in both waves refer to previous malware like ROADSWEEP ransomware and ZEROCLEARE ransomware.While attribution is inconclusive, the malware shows strong similarities to previous ransomware from both waves, with code similarities including file paths, encryption schemes, registry keys, file hashes, and other artifacts.The attackers used stolen certificates from Nvidia and Kuwait Telecommunications to sign and distribute the malware in an apparent breach of trust.Technical details are provided on how the malware functions, including the encryption, encryption, and disk encryption techniques.Defenders are advised to monitor the ransom notes and configuration information for signatures to detect the malware activity.","The cybercriminal group Lazarus has been conducting cyberattacks against Albanian government entities in two waves, using ransomware and data-wiping malware signed with stolen certificates.The first wave occurred in July 2022, impacting Albanian e-services.The second wave started in September, targeting critical law enforcement systems with similar malware but modified for detection evasion.Wave 2 ransomware samples share similarities with wave 1, including the use of CreateFile and WriteFile APIs for file overwrites and RC4 encryption algorithm.The ransomware in both waves is based on ROADSWEEP, uses stolen certificates to appear legitimate, and encrypts files in an unrecoverable way, rendering a ransom demand ineffective.The wiper malware embeds a raw disk driver for direct access to wipe data quickly.In the second wave, the attackers used a leaked Nvidia code signing certificate to sign the wiper and embedded the disk driver within the malware for automated execution post-installation.They also modified messaging and encryption keys to evade security controls.Underground posts suggest the attackers may have used AnyDesk for initial access.Different attack groups speaking Persian and another language appear to be cooperating in the campaign.The malware contains political messaging reflecting tensions between Albania and Iran.The targeting of law enforcement and modifications for speed align with prior devastating Shamoon wiper attacks in the Middle East.Defenders are advised to monitor for suspicious certificates and remote access software to detect potential intrusions.The publication provides indicators of compromise and detection details for the malware."
"The document describes activity by a threat actor called Blue Mockingbird that is deploying Monero cryptocurrency-mining payloads on Windows machines at multiple organizations.Initial access is gained by exploiting CVE-2019-18935, a vulnerability in Telerik UI that allows the attacker to gain initial access by abusing the privileges of a DCOM class in IIS Application Pool Identity.The attacker then uses Process Injection to inject two DLLs into a web application, one as a DLL and another as a.NET executable.The DLL is used to escalate privileges via process injection.Privilege Escalation is achieved by using XMRIG, a cross-platform DLL that can compile into a Monero miner.The miner fetches the payload and connects to the attacker's command and control server for persistence using COR_PROFILER.Corprofiler fetches additional payloads from commonly used Monero-mining domains.The binary payloads have a baseline C2 IP address and use scheduled tasks to avoid detection.The report provides technical analysis of CORprofiler's capabilities.It also covers detection strategies for Process Injections, SSL tunneling, and other techniques.","The document describes a threat actor called Blue Mockingbird that has been deploying Monero cryptocurrency mining malware on Windows machines across multiple organizations.Blue Mockingbird gains initial access by exploiting the CVE-2019-18935 vulnerability in Telerik UI web applications.The attacker leverages the privileges of a DCOM class and IIS Application Pool Identity's SeImpersonate privilege to perform the escalation.Once in, they use various techniques like process injection, DLL sideloading, and privilege escalation to deploy and persist a malicious Monero miner built on XMRig.The miner payload communicates with external mining pools to mine Monero.Blue Mockingbird uses lateral movement techniques like RDP and Windows admin shares to distribute the payload across the network.Blue Mockingbird appears to experiment with different tools, such as Fast Reverse Proxy (frp), Secure Socket Funneling (SSF), and Venom, to pivot between systems.They have also experimented with different reverse shell and proxy tools for command and control.Persistence mechanisms involve hijacking services like wercplsupport using COR_PROFILER COM hijacking.The malware compiles each payload with a list of commonly used Monero-mining domains and a wallet address, which can be extracted from the binary or observed in network traffic.Red Canary provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, Monero wallet addresses, and analytics to detect the miner payloads, privilege escalation, and lateral movement.They also advise patching public-facing apps and establishing a baseline of normal scheduled tasks.In summary, the document analyzes a sophisticated, evolving threat actor distributing stealthy cryptocurrency miners using multiple intrusion techniques across victim networks."
