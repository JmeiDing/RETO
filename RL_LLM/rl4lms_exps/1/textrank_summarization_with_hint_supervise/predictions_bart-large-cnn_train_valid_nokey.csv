"The PDF describes a targeted cyberattack campaign called Operation GreedyWonk that compromised multiple economic and foreign policy sites to serve up a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe Flash.The sites targeted included the Peterson Institute, Smith Richardson Foundation, and the American Research Center in Egypt.The attackers used hidden iframes to redirect visitors to an exploit server hosting the Flash exploit.The exploit allows overwriting the vftable pointer of a Flash object to redirect code execution.Once executed, it installs a remote access trojan called PlugX/Kaba which gathers system info and sends it to a command and control server.The group behind this appears to have sufficient resources and a determination to infect visitors to foreign and public policy websites.The threat actors likely sought to infect users to these sites for follow-on data theft, including information related to defense and policy matters.Adobe has released a patch for the Flash vulnerability, which is CVE-2014-0502, and FireEye is collaborating with Adobe security on patching it.The campaign appears to be related to previous activity outlined in 2012 by a threat actor named ShadowServer based on tactics, techniques, infrastructure, and malware configuration details.The report recommends mitigations like upgrading from Windows XP to Windows 7, using out-of-date Office 2007/2010, or upgrading from Java 1.6 to 1.7.The ASLR bypass bypass in Office 2007-2010 is addressed by Microsoft's Security Bulletin MS13-106.The Microsoft Office HXDS.dll vulnerability was patched at the end of 2013.In summary, the report provides technical details on how the attack leverages a previously unknown Flash vulnerability to bypass Windows ASLR protections.It leveraged in this campaign to infecting multiple nonprofit sites and exfiltrating data.","The document describes an attack campaign dubbed ""Operation GreedyWonk"" that was discovered in February 2014.The campaign involved compromising multiple websites related to economic policy, foreign affairs, and national security.Visitors to these compromised sites were redirected to an exploit server hosting a zero-day Flash exploit (CVE-2014-0502).The goal was to infect visitors, especially those interested in defense and public policy matters, with malware for follow-on data theft.The exploit bypassed Windows ASLR protections by targeting systems still running Windows XP or having outdated Java and Microsoft Office.Once the exploit succeeded, it installed a remote access trojan called PlugX/Kaba.This malware variant was compiled shortly before discovery, indicating it was specifically built for this campaign.Researchers believe GreedyWonk may be connected to an earlier 2012 campaign that used similar tradecraft and infrastructure.Malware samples from both campaigns connected to overlapping domains that previously resolved to the same IP addresses.The group behind the campaigns appears sufficiently resourced to access zero-days and remains a credible threat.The report highlights the actor's persistence in compromising policy and defense-related websites, early access to exploits, ability to re-compromise sites, and deployment of various malware families.This demonstrates an adversary with mature capabilities that continues to pose a threat through strategic web compromises to infect visitors from specific communities."
"The report provides an overview of major cybersecurity threats and trends observed in 2018.It highlights an increase in phishing attacks and messaging malware, with 82% more IP addresses blocked compared to 2017.Exploit kits and automated exploits are no longer enough to fully exploit vulnerabilities.Instead, cybercriminals are increasingly relying on human-targeted social engineering attacks like phishing and BEC.Cryptocurrency mining attacks surged 237% to over 1.3 million detections, driven by a ""gold rush"" in cryptocurrency-mining attack methods.New CPU-level vulnerabilities were disclosed, including Meltdown and Spectre, which allowed speculative execution of new CPU instructions.Vulnerable home network devices like routers and routers were targeted, often using fileless threats to evade traditional methods like traffic monitoring, behavioral indicators, and sandboxing.The first public disclosure of a Kubernetes cloud software vulnerability was also a big issue, as vendors rushed to patch quickly before widespread use.Overall, ransomware usage decreased significantly, likely due to better ransomware solutions and awareness of the threat.However, new ransomware families like WannaCry dominated the threat landscape.Social engineering remained an effective social engineering tactic, with phishing, BEC, and exploit kits becoming less profitable as a result.Defending against phishing requires advanced threat detection, monitoring, and incident response capabilities.The report aims to provide valuable insights to help enterprises bolster security defenses against evolving threats and vulnerabilities.","The document provides an overview of major cybersecurity threats and issues in 2018.Messaging threats like phishing increased, with an 82% rise in blocked phishing URLs.Business email compromise attacks also grew targeting enterprise employees.Ransomware declined significantly, with detections down 91% and fewer new families, though WannaCry remained prevalent.Cryptocurrency mining detections grew 237%.Fileless threats that evade traditional antivirus rose 819%.Major hardware vulnerabilities like Meltdown and Spectre were disclosed.Attacks exploited known vulnerabilities for cryptocurrency mining rather than zero-days.Many critical flaws were found in industrial and IoT systems.Router malware continued via recycled Mirai code and new threats like VPNFilter.IoT devices were abused for cryptomining and pharming.As homes add more smart devices, routers become a key attack vector.Trend Micro research covered areas like machine learning for security, critical infrastructure risks, cybercriminal takedowns, and threat evolution.In 2018, over 48 billion threats were blocked, mostly email threats.WannaCry dominated ransomware while other families declined.The report highlights key issues like social engineering, hardware flaws, IoT threats, messaging attacks, and ransomware.It provides data on threat trends and research insights for enterprises to be aware of latest risks."
"The document analyzes the evolution of the Agent.BTZ/ComRAT remote access trojan (RAT) malware from 2007-2012, which is linked to the Uroburos rootkit.The evolution covers 7 years of development and shows the malware was likely developed between 2007-2008.The earliest sample dates back to 2007, with versions dating back to 1.0.The most advanced version (Version 1.2.0) was compiled in late 2007.The main components of the RAT are listed, along with the versioning of each version from 1.1.0 to Version 2.04.Version 3.4.0 was compiled around mid-2010.The RAT has been active since at least 2007 and has targeted government, military, financial, law enforcement, and critical infrastructure organizations.It uses encrypted C2 communications to communicate with its command and control server.The document provides an overview of the evolving evolution of RATs over 7 years, showing the use of new versions, versioning, encryption schemes, and other technical details to evade detection.It demonstrates the sophistication of sophisticated, modular malware used in targeted cyberespionage campaigns.Recommendations are provided for detection and prevention.","The document analyzes the evolution of the sophisticated ComRAT malware, which is the successor to the Agent.BTZ remote access trojan (RAT).Both are linked to the Uroburos rootkit and used by the same threat actor in targeted campaigns.The analysis covers 7 years of development across 10 major versions of the RAT, from Agent.BTZ v1.0 in 2007 to ComRAT v3.26 in 2014.Version info shows incremental changes over time with the biggest update in v3.00 transitioning it from Agent.BTZ to ComRAT.Early versions of Agent.BTZ rely on AutoRun for infection and use a simple XOR cipher and ASCII config.Later versions add obfuscation, support for Windows Vista, bug fixes, and COM object hijacking.ComRAT in v3.00 switches compilers, name, comms, injects all processes, and leverages pipes for IPC.It exfiltrates more system info and abandons AutoRun.Later versions add logging, multiple C2s, new registry persistence, and further string obfuscation.The RAT evolved to support new Windows versions, evade detection, fix bugs, and enhance capabilities over time.The timeline matches reported attacks on high-value targets like government bodies.The threat actor behind it continues to actively develop multiple malware strains to compromise targets.Their tools show an interest in persisting on systems long-term while exfiltrating sensitive data.The analysis provides valuable historical insight into the adversary's malware development lifecycle over many years."
"Recorded Future developed new algorithms to detect influence operations on social media.They identified a new influence operation called Fishwrap that republikaizes old terror attack news as if it were new.Over 215 accounts were analyzed participating in Fishwrap campaigns.The accounts use a family of URL shortener services that allow tracking the effectiveness of the operation.All of these URL services are running the same code and are hosted on the same commercial infrastructure.Behavioral analytics can be used to analyze the highest-likelihood participants in an operation and cluster those with the highest degree of similarity.For example, if accounts are more similar in URLs, hashtags, and user accounts, then they are likely part of the same influence operation.The Snowball algorithm generates false positives if it finds too many innocent ""innocent"" accounts, but it can also find positives if a large number of accounts are part of an operation.To characterize an operation, the algorithm defines similarity levels based on shared accounts, URLs, and hashtags.It can then grow the number of potential ""seed"" accounts engaged in the operation, starting with a few accounts or with topics believed to be of interest to the campaign.This allows the analysis to grow rapidly.The Fishwrap operation demonstrates the increasing sophistication of social media-based influence operations being used by nation-states and groups seeking to influence public opinion.While attribution is difficult due to anonymous hosting, the accounts' similarities to each other and URL shorteners make it more difficult to attribute.The report provides indicators of compromise and recommendations for detection.","The cybersecurity firm Recorded Future has developed new algorithms to identify and analyze influence operations on social media.Using these methods, they discovered a coordinated influence campaign called ""Fishwrap"" that spreads old terror news stories as if they were new, likely to provoke fear and uncertainty.Recorded Future identified over 200 social media accounts participating in Fishwrap.The accounts exhibit similarities in timing of activity, topics posted, use of specific URL shortening services, and account suspension rates.This leads Recorded Future to believe the accounts are part of the same influence operation.The influence operation uses a network of 10 URL shortening services that appear identical in design and are hosted on the same infrastructure.The URLs allow the operators to track those who click through, possibly to analyze the effectiveness and target audience.The domains are anonymously registered, making attribution difficult.Given the significant time and infrastructure investment, Recorded Future speculates this is an influence operation by a political entity or nation-state rather than individuals.The goal seems to be spreading fear by repackaging old terror stories as new news.While not outright fake news, the stories are presented deceptively via the network of social media accounts."
"The document analyzes the links between the Sardonic ransomware group and a new backdoor malware called F5 used by the threat actor group FIN8.Sardonic and F5 both contain encrypted shellcode containing the Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4) encryption key, with the decryption key contained in the DLL.The functionality of Sardonic.NET assembly MDAC.dll and the F5 assembly ""Default.dll"" has strong similarities.Some features of the PowerShell script and.NET DLL mentioned in the Bitdefender paper appear to have been removed, such as the ""4BMARC2WKL"" marker prepending the shellcode in ""MDAC.""and the ""O5518470.kfC09272::p65E1a71.dll"".However, other minor features like the method name ""MSDAC.PerfOSChecker::StartCheck"" exist in F5.F5 uses a new Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) consumer for the PowerShell scripts.It is possible efforts to configure F5 to establish persistence were abandoned once a decision was made to deploy ransomware.The malware generates a 32-byte hardware ID based on the computer name and C volume serial number.The system time and hardware ID are encrypted with a custom algorithm and placed into a 64-byte buffer before an attempt is made to connect to the C2 server after 5 attempts, if the victim is unable to reach the command and control server after five attempts, it will terminate.The logs show that the filename of the malware hosting the malware was always a random 6-byte alphanumeric string, however changed nearly every time the command was run.White Rabbit continues to be active and dangerous threat actor.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, domain names, and IP addresses associated with the group's activities.","Here is a summary of the key points from the report on the Sardonic and F5 malware used by the White Rabbit ransomware group: - White Rabbit is a ransomware group linked to the cybercrime group FIN8 in previous research.- Lodestone security researchers analyzed a new FIN8 backdoor called F5 that shows strong similarities to an earlier backdoor called Sardonic.- Both Sardonic and F5 use RC4 encryption for shellcode, gzip compression, and minor differences in decryption routines.F5 removed some features like process killing.- The PowerShell loader script downloads the backdoor DLL from a server using random URLs, likely indicating manual control by a human operator.- F5 checks for ""powershell.exe"" as the parent process, copies the LSASS access token, and connects to a C2 server after encrypting the system ID.- The White Rabbit ransomware itself is highly obfuscated, uses invalid certificates, and command line arguments to specify encryption parameters.It deletes itself after encrypting files.- Technical details, IP addresses, domains, filenames, YARA rules, and other IOCs are provided for detection of the malware and its C2 infrastructure.- The report examines the evolution of FIN8's malware arsenal from Sardonic to F5 based on code reuse and shared tactics, reinforcing the link between FIN8 and White Rabbit."
"The document analyzes cyberespionage campaigns conducted by an APT group believed to be from China that planted backdoors in high-profile organizations in Central Asia to gain long-term access to corporate networks.The group frequently recompiled their custom tools to avoid detection, including Mimikatz and Gh0st RAT.The backdoors gave the actors the ability to manipulate and delete files, take screenshots, manipulate processes, and services, execute commands, remove itself, and more.They could also be commanded by a C&C server to act as a proxy or listen on a speciﬁc port on every network interface.Links were found between the malware samples and campaigns like Microcin, BYEBY, and Vicious Panda, previously described by Kaspersky, Palo Alto Networks, and Check Point.The targeted companies and institutions are located in Mongolia, Russia, Belarus, and Central Asia.The malware samples contain links to previous campaigns by the same group, suggesting the attackers are from China.Similarities in the code and targeting suggest the group may be affiliated with Chinese state-sponsored actors.The report provides technical details on the backdoors, persistence mechanisms, command and control infrastructure, and indicators of compromise like file hashes, domains, and IP addresses associated with the campaign.It also covers detection methods like AV signatures and VMProtect signatures to identify the malware.In summary, the document provides an in-depth look at the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by a suspected Chinese APT to compromise high-value corporate networks and steal data from Central Asia, likely for espionage and data exfiltration.","The document describes an advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign targeting high-profile companies in Central Asia that was analyzed by Avast and ESET.The attackers planted backdoors to gain long-term access to corporate networks.The threat actors frequently recompiled their custom malware tools to avoid detection.The tools included backdoors, Mimikatz, and Gh0st RAT.Many samples were protected by VMProtect obfuscation.The backdoors gave the attackers capabilities to manipulate files, take screenshots, manipulate processes and services, execute commands, proxy network traffic, exfiltrate data, and more.Lateral movement within compromised networks was achieved using Mimikatz credential theft and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).Attribution points to an APT group possibly from China, based on code similarities with past campaigns like Vicious Panda, the use of Gh0st RAT, and the professional coding techniques.Most command and control servers were registered with Choopa LLC hosting.Avast and ESET detected and blocked the malware before this campaign was fully analyzed.The threat actors are suspected to still be active, as similar attacks were seen targeting Central Asia recently."
"The document analyzes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of an advanced persistent threat (APT) group called Animal Farm that has been active since at least 2009.Animal Farm has targeted government, military, humanitarian, media, and activist organizations worldwide, including government agencies, military contractors, NGOs, media organizations, and more.The group uses custom malware like Bunny, Casper, Dino, Babar, NBot, Tafacalou, and Dino Plus for initial access, persistence, and data exfiltration.The malware includes validator-style trojans like Bunny that act as an entry point for more sophisticated spyware like Babar and Dino.Dino Plus is a full-featured espionage platform with DDoS capabilities.NBot is malware used in botnet-style operations for DDoS.Most victims are in Syria, Iran, Malaysia, China, India, and other Middle Eastern countries.The report provides technical analysis of the various malware families used by Animal Farm, including: - Bunny - an old ""validator"" trojan used with PDF zero-days in 2011-2012.- Casper - a recent validator trojan deployed via watering hole attacks in Syria.- Babar - sophisticated espionage platform.- NBot - DDoS botnet malware used by the group.- Unknown malware used against Burkina Faso victims.- Sinkholing of command and control servers by Kaspersky Lab revealed details on the group's infrastructure and victimology.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at Animal Farm's tactics, tools, infrastructure, victimology, and timeline of campaigns.It highlights the ongoing threat posed by this sophisticated APT group to organizations globally.","The document describes the activities of a sophisticated cyberespionage threat actor that Kaspersky Lab researchers have dubbed ""Animal Farm.""Animal Farm has been active since at least 2009 and targets a wide range of organizations globally, including government agencies, military contractors, humanitarian groups, private companies, journalists, activists, and more.Animal Farm uses several custom malware families as part of its operations, which Kaspersky has categorized into 6 groups: Bunny, Dino, Babar, NBot, Tafacalou, and Casper.Each malware family has different capabilities and is deployed at different stages of Animal Farm's attacks.For example, Tafacalou is used as an initial infection vector to then deploy more advanced malware like Dino or Babar on high-value targets.By analyzing command and control server logs, Kaspersky has identified numerous Animal Farm victims, with concentrations in Syria, Iran, Malaysia, the US, China, Turkey, and various European countries.The name Tafacalou may derive from the Occitan language and mean ""so it's getting hot,"" suggesting the malware is heating up or escalating its attacks.Animal Farm has used at least 3 zero-day vulnerabilities over the years to distribute its malware, including via PDF and watering hole attacks.The group continues to evolve its tactics, techniques, and procedures.Kaspersky assesses with high confidence that Animal Farm operates on behalf of a nation-state sponsor based on its sophisticated capabilities and global targeting aligned with espionage objectives.Kaspersky did not attribute Animal Farm to a specific country in this report.In summary, Animal Farm is a highly capable, long-running cyberespionage actor that deploys multiple custom malware families and constantly innovates to compromise new targets globally, likely in support of a nation-state's intelligence requirements.Ongoing monitoring and research is required to track this advanced persistent threat."
"The document analyzes a new version of the OceanLotus backdoor for macOS that was discovered recently.This backdoor is targeted towards victims in Vietnam and still maintains extremely low AV detection despite being in the wild for over a year.The initial infection vector is believed to be via an email attachment containing a zip file containing a password-protected Word document.When opened, it executes and launches a hidden executable file that disguises itself as a legitimate application bundle.The malware uses a decoy Word document to help mask the execution of the malware.It also copies the bundle to the executable path and essentially replaces the application bundle after persistence has been set up.The persistence mechanism creates a Launch Agent that runs when the victim host starts up, where as in the previous version execution was upon when a user logs in, this version copies itself to a diﬀerent  location and ﬁlename based on the username of the user who ran the application.The executable is stored in the system wide library directory at  /Library/TimeMachine/bin/mtmfs.plist/OpenSSL/ and deletes the executable bundle from its place, leaving a new location as a service.No Command Utilities are present in this new version.This lack of command line utilities provides context as to what the malware might do on a victim host at different times.In most cases, the malware calls the system exec() or runs system functions to run the system service, which may indicate the malicious intent.The backdoor uses a custom string encoding mechanism, custom binary protocol traf ﬃc with encryption, and a modularized backdoor.While there are some similarities to previous versions, the new version has made several improvements including: - Using a new obfuscation techniques to trick the OS into thinking it is an application bundle and not a malicious executable.This technique is common for Windows but rare on macOS.- Encrypting the decoy document with a hardcoded MD5 hash instead of a plaintext.- Using string encoding instead of plaintext to hide the executable.- Removing the use of utilities like getpwuid() to avoid detection.- Modifying the command and control servers to be located in Vietnam rather than just in the US.- Notable features of the backdoor include: - A modular architecture, advanced string encoding, encrypted C2 communication, custom string compression, and an encrypted backdoor.- Low false positives indicating the malware is still active and actively being used in active operations.- The backdoor can be found","The document describes a new backdoor malware called OceanLotus that has been found targeting MacOS devices, primarily in Vietnam.OceanLotus is an advanced and sophisticated piece of malware that has improved over previous versions in several ways: It uses a decoy Word document to disguise itself when executed.This tricks the user into thinking they opened a normal document.It establishes persistence in a clever way, storing itself in locations that mimic real MacOS applications and processes.This helps it blend in and avoid detection.It does not use suspicious command line utilities, making static analysis more difficult.It uses a custom encrypted network protocol to communicate with its command and control server, not standard web protocols.The encryption keys change per session.It can receive additional modules from the server, expanding its functionality dynamically.It exfiltrates system information from the infected machine back to the server, including username, network information, model details, etc.The authors appear to be espionage motivated and targeting MacOS specifically as it becomes more widely used.The malware continues to avoid detection very successfully.The report concludes that MacOS is increasingly being targeted and strong security practices need to be applied to it like other platforms.Defenses have been updated to detect this threat."
"The PDF describes an ongoing spearphishing campaign targeting point-of-sale (PoS) systems by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group using tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) like fileless malware and memory-resident malware to steal payment card data from retailer PoS systems.The attack starts with a phishing email containing a macro-enabled ActiveMIME document.If opened, it deploys a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a malicious DLL file.The DLL drops a shellcode blob containing a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) malware called ShellTea.ShellTea conducts reconnaissance of the environment and contacts command and control servers to receive further instructions.It establishes persistence using compromised credentials and establishes staging servers for deploying malware and collecting data from PoS endpoints.The malware injects memory-resident code into a privileged user mode process and can specify which PoS processes should be monitored for payment card transactions.An advanced PoS RAM scraping malware called PoSlurp is deployed to the POS endpoints and injected directly into the memory of a privileged process.This capability has not been previously reported.The attackers set up staging servers to spread the workload and provide redundancy to thwart defensive measures.The campaign has targeted multiple retailers and POS systems over several months.The PDF provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, domains, and YARA rules to detect the malware and associated infrastructure.It demonstrates sophisticated techniques by a financially-motivated threat actor to compromise POS systems and steal large amounts of payment card information.The report aims to raise awareness of this threat.","The document describes a point-of-sale malware campaign targeting retailers.It begins with a phishing email containing macros that download an initial reconnaissance implant.This is followed by deployment of a persistent backdoor called ShellTea and a memory-scraping POS malware called PoSlurp.ShellTea injects into Explorer and uses obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.PoSlurp directly injects into targeted POS processes to steal payment card data.The report analyzes the technical details of the malware and provides mitigation recommendations focused on restricting macros, limiting exposed credentials, whitelisting, monitoring, and network segmentation."

"ESET researchers discovered a new malicious loader for Windows binaries that runs as a server and executes received modules in memory.The loader, named Wslink, has been active for over 2 years but the initial infection vector is unknown, with most samples using MPRESS packed with MPRESS and virtualized code.The initial compromise vector is not known either.The most recently received encrypted module with its signature is stored globally, making it available to all clients globally.The client implementation establishes a connection with a modified Wslinks server and sends a module that is then decrypted and executed.The decrypted module is loaded into memory using the MemoryModule library and its first export is finally executed, with functions for communication, socket, key and IV being passed in a parameter to the export, enabling the module to exchange messages over the already established connection.This client's source code shows how one can reuse and interact with existing functions of previously analyzed malware.The analysis could also serve as an informative resource documenting this threat for blue teamers.In summary, the document describes the discovery of a new, previously undiscovered, malicious loader that runs server-side on Windows systems, allowing it to receive encrypted modules and decrypt and execute them in memory without writing them to disk.","The PDF describes a new and unique malware loader called Wslink discovered by ESET researchers.Wslink runs as a service on compromised Windows systems and listens on a specified port for incoming connections.Unlike other loaders, Wslink executes received modules directly in memory rather than writing them to disk.It uses a sophisticated cryptographic protocol involving RSA and AES encryption to securely receive and decrypt modules from a command and control server.After establishing a connection, Wslink performs an RSA key exchange to securely transmit a symmetric AES key.The encrypted module is then sent along with a signature and decryption key.The decrypted module is loaded into memory using a library and its export function executed.Modules can reuse Wslink's communication functions to send data over the existing socket.The most recent module and signature are stored globally, allowing the C2 to just send the decryption key for previously sent modules.ESET has seen limited detections of Wslink in Europe, North America, and the Middle East.The initial infection vector is unknown.Samples are packed and code virtualized, hampering analysis.No links to known threat groups have been found.ESET implemented a Wslink client to connect to a modified server and send modules, confirming the protocol and aiding detection methods.The client source code may help beginners in malware analysis by interacting with real malware functions.In summary, Wslink is a sophisticated loader implementing novel techniques like server-based module loading and an RSA-AES encrypted communication protocol.While current impact is low, its capabilities highlight continuing evolution of malware loader tactics."
"The PDF describes a new backdoor called skip.0 discovered by ESET researchers that targets Microsoft SQL Server 11 and 12 using a magic password.This backdoor shares multiple similarities with the PortReuse backdoor used by the Winnti Group cyberespionage group, which has been active since at least 2012 targeting the video game and software industries.The VMProtected launcher used by skip.2-0 is embedded in the PE overlay and contains a payload that is encrypted with a key derived from the VolumeID and the string f@Ukd!r$., as described in our previous article.Persistence is achieved by exploiting a Windows DLL hijacking vulnerability C:\Windows\System\WindowsTSVIPSr.LL.Once decrypted, the embedded payload is loaded by the Windows SessionEnvirus service at system startup.The backdoor uses the same custom packer and VMProtection launcher used to pack and launch the PortRuse backdoor and ShadowPad versions.It uses an identical packer to that used with the payload embedded in compromised video games.The payload encryption is RC5-encrypted with a value derived from VolumeID.The packer contains the decryption key as well as the original execution size and size of the backdoor.This backdoored payload can be used to stealthily copy, modify, or delete database content, allowing the attacker to manipulate in-game currencies for financial gain.To the best of our knowledge, skip-2.0 is the ﬁrst MSSQL Server backdoor to be documented publicly.While not the most recent version, it is the most commonly used, as MSSSql Server 11/12 is commonly used by most systems.The report provides technical details on the backdoor's functionality, including the use of the same VMProtector and packer, the same encryption keys, and other similarities with other tools from Winnt Group's arsenal.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at the technical details and capabilities of a previously undocumented backdoor used recently by the notorious Winnt group, shedding light on their latest tool.","The document describes analysis of a new backdoor called skip-2.0 used by the Winnti cyberespionage group to target Microsoft SQL Server.Winnti has been active since at least 2012 conducting supply chain attacks against the video game and software industries.Skip-2.0 allows the attacker to stealthily connect to any MSSQL account using a hardcoded magic password.It achieves this by installing hooks in the sqllang.dll library used by MSSQL Server to bypass authentication and disable logging of the unauthorized access.The malware uses the same VMProtected launcher, custom packer, and injector techniques seen in other Winnti tools like PortReuse and ShadowPad.An injector called Inner-Loader injects the skip-2.0 DLL into the sqlserv.exe process.Skip-2.0 locates and hooks functions in sqllang.dll related to password validation, logging, and auditing using pattern matching.If the magic password is provided, the hooks spoof validation and disable logging.This gives Winnti stealthy persistence and access to manipulate or steal data from compromised MSSQL Servers.Skip-2.0 was found to be effective against MSSQL Server versions 11 and 12.The malware shares multiple similarities with other Winnti tools, leading researchers to attribute it to their arsenal for targeted cyberespionage campaigns.Defenses like monitoring for anomalies and enforcing certificate validation are recommended."
"The document analyzes a modular malware framework called MosaicRegressor that was found embedded in compromised UEFI firmware files.It is a multi-stage framework aimed at espionage and data gathering using downloaders and intermediate loaders to fetch payloads from compromised systems.The initial stages of the framework were found in two known cases where it was installed in the victim's firmware, achieving the above-OS level of persistence.The components were compiled from the source code of a leaked Hacking Team bootkit called VectorEDK that was leaked in 2015.The bootkit component SmmAccessSub is the main component that serves as a persistent dropper for user-mode malware.It retrieves the next stage payload from a command and control server.The second stage downloader, Curl, is a downloader that retrieves and executes the final payload from the command server.This payload is a WinRAR archive containing encrypted configuration data.The final payloads are encrypted RAR SFX droppers for the Curl downloaders, encrypted DLLs for the BITS Downloader, and encrypted binaries for the CryptoSysPrep and OLE2 droppers.The malware uses various techniques to evade detection, including setting a hardcoded ""fTA"" value in the bootkit driver to mark its execution, setting a callback to boot, and modifying the ID field in the C2 server.In one case, the malware was found in the startup directory of the UEFI bootkit, indicating it was likely compiled from source code that was not properly leveraged by the developers.The modular framework uses multiple stages for persistence, data gathering, and data exfiltration.The report provides in-depth technical analysis of the components and their functions.It highlights the importance of keeping software patched and updated to avoid unauthorized modifications.","The document provides technical details on a malware framework named MosaicRegressor that is used for espionage and data gathering.MosaicRegressor has been seen installed in victim UEFI firmware for persistence.It uses a leaked HackingTeam bootkit called VectorEDK.It has multiple stages and components.Initial downloaders written in C++ fetch additional modules from command and control servers.The downloaders use BITS jobs, libcurl, WinHTTP API, or check webmail for modules.Email attachments are decrypted DLLs or executables.Downloaded modules collect system info and send it to command servers.Later stages exfiltrate documents and data.Components have varying levels of obfuscation.Strings are Base64 or XOR encoded.Payloads use simple exported functions.There are language artifacts suggesting some developers are of Chinese or Korean origin.Code similarities exist to Gaza Hacker Team.Targets are primarily in the Middle East.Both opportunistic attacks and tailored phishing emails have been observed.Low sophistication but modular design makes MosaicRegressor extensible.Persistence in firmware raises the stakes of infections.While not advanced, the framework's continuing evolution, targeting, and shadowy control indicate an experienced threat actor."
"Proofpoint researchers have observed a Russian-speaking APT group called Turla using a new.NET/MSIL dropper for an existing JavaScript backdoor called KopiLuwak.The dropper is being delivered with a benign decoy document inviting recipients to a G20 task force meeting on the ""Digital Economy"".The Digital Economy event is actually scheduled for October of this year in Hamburg, Germany.The delivery method is currently unknown as the dropper has only been observed on a public malware repository.Based on the theme of the decoy PDF, it is very possible that the intended targets are individuals or organizations that are on or have an interest in G20's Digital Economy Task Force.This could include diplomats, experts in the areas of interest related to the Digital economy Task Force, or possibly even journalists.If the document is fabricated, it may indicate an entity with access to the G20 invitation was already compromised.Alternatively, the document may have been obtained from a legitimate source.The initial infection starts with a.NET dropper that drops and executes both a PDF decoy and a Javascript (JS) dropper.The JS dropper ultimately installs a JS decryptor onto an infected machine that decrypts and executes the actual KopiSuwak backdoor in memory only.The MSIL payload is written to memory and contains no obfuscation or anti-analysis.The malware is not widely observed in the wild so there are possible ways it could have been delivered including spear phishing or watering hole attacks.In summary, this document provides an in-depth analysis of how the Turla APT actor is using the new MSIL malware dropper to deliver a new JavaScript backdoor variant to targets likely related to their previous activities.","The document analyzes a new variant of the Turla APT group's KopiLuwak JavaScript backdoor being spread via a.NET dropper.The dropper was found on a malware repository and delivered the backdoor along with a G20-themed decoy document.This suggests targets may be involved in the G20 Digital Economy Task Force.The MSIL dropper drops and executes the Stage1 JS dropper and a PDF decoy.The JS dropper sets persistence, fingerprints the system, and installs the JS backdoor decryptor.The backdoor uses RC4 encryption and communicates with two compromised websites.It can exfiltrate data, download files, and execute arbitrary commands from the attacker.Changes from older versions include additional system fingerprinting, hardcoded network communication values, and a new command for downloading files.While the full scope of attacks leveraging this variant is unknown, its continual evolution highlights Turla's capabilities and efforts to refine their tools against high-value diplomatic and government targets."
"APT42 is an Iranian state-sponsored cyber espionage group that has been active since at least 2015.The group conducts highly targeted spear phishing campaigns to build trust and rapport with targets before attempting to steal their credentials.Once inside a target's network, APT42 deploys mobile malware capable of tracking locations, recording conversations, accessing videos and images, and extracting entire SMS inboxes.They have also used credential harvesting to collect Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) codes to bypass authentication methods and pursue access to the networks, devices, and accounts of employers, colleagues and relatives.As of late 2015, a subset of APT41’s infrastructure served as command-and-control (C2) servers for Android mobile malware designed to track locations, monitor communications, and generally surveil the activities of individuals of interest to the Iranian government, including activists and dissidents inside Iran.APT 42 has targeted organizations in at least 14 countries since its first observation in 2015, including in Australia, Europe, the Middle East, the United States, and Iran.The targeting patterns indicate APT421 operates on behalf of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Intelligence Organization based on targeting patterns that align with the organization's operational mandates and priorities.This indicates APT43 is trusted by Tehran to quickly react to geopolitical shifts in support of Iranian strategic interests.Some of these shifts include targeting the pharmaceutical sector at the onset of COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, pursuing domestic opposition groups prior to an Iranian presidential election in 2020, and altering their operational focus as Iran's priorities evolve over time.The report provides indicators of compromise, including file hashes, domains, IP addresses, and YARA rules.It also covers detection capabilities and mitigation advice.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at the sophisticated tools, techniques, and procedures used by the Iranian APT group to conduct cyberespionage and surveillance against high-value targets in countries around the world.It emphasizes the need for continued vigilance and intelligence sharing to counter this persistent threat.","Here is a summary of the key points from the Mandiant report on the Iranian state-sponsored hacking group APT42: APT42 is a prolific Iranian cyber espionage group active since at least 2015.Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence they operate on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).The group relies on highly targeted spear phishing to compromise accounts and mobile devices of individuals and organizations of interest to Iran.This includes government officials, journalists, academics, and dissidents.Once compromised, APT42 has deployed Android malware capable of location tracking, recording communications, and stealing SMS messages and images.APT42 focuses on building trust with targets before sending credential harvesting links or attachments.They often impersonate journalists over weeks before acting maliciously.The group has consistently targeted Western think tanks, the Iranian diaspora, and the personal accounts of government officials.Their targeting aligns with Iranian intelligence priorities.APT42 uses a range of custom malware in operations, including backdoors, keyloggers, and Android surveillance tools.Some tools reuse code from public GitHub repositories.The report provides technical details on APT42's tactics, known malware, infrastructure, targeting, and attributes them with high confidence to the Iranian government based on strategic alignment."
"The document analyzes a remote access trojan (RAT) called ProjectSauron APT.The module spawns a thread, creates a named pipe ""\\.\pipe\rpchlp_0"", waits for connections to that pipe, and creates another thread to carry out communication.It receives a 8-byte RC4 key and body of a command to run.Next it creates three pipes, "":\pipe\pchpc_1"", "":\ pipe\rchlp_.2"", and "":\ pipes\rpc_3"", for standard file handles (stdin, stdout, stderr) and waits for all these pipes to connect.Depending on the command received, it may either execute the shellcode or start a process with the given command line and redirects RC4 encrypted input/output from all the handles from/to the sender.The shellcode blob starts with a magic value ""0xC102AA02"" (DWORD) and runs in case the process token contains a ""S-1-5-6"" (Service) sid.The configuration consists of 1-3 DLL files, the first one being the main module and 1-2 optional plugins.The main module enumerates all available plugins and starts them by calling the function exported by the name ""ainit"".The configuration is in readable text format.It locates its configuration data in the resource ""CONFIG"" of type ""RT_CONFIG"".The resource is encrypted using AES-CBC with a hardcoded key ""EFEB0A9C6ABA4CF5958F41DB6A31929776C643DEDC65CC9B67AB8B0066FF2492"".The key is not encrypted and can be located in the memory of the target processes while the module is running.The business logic is provided by one of the exported functions and is triggered when the corresponding system layer loads the library.When invoked, the module decrypts the first layer from the blob that contains actual code.The blob contains another layer of shellcode that loads, relocates, and invokes the PE binary inside.This backdoor contains the payload using the Jcalg1 algorithm.The payload decrypts and decompresses its payload using AES encryption.The backdoor can be installed as an LSA password manager library, or as a Security Provider.Technical analysis provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, C2 domains, and YARA rules to detect this threat","The document provides an in-depth technical analysis of the ProjectSauron APT malware and infrastructure.It covers multiple components used for initial infection, persistence, data exfiltration, command and control, and more.Key points: Uses LSA password filters or security providers for stealthy persistence and password theft.Custom LUA scripts control modular malware functionality.Over 50 plugin types exist.Virtual file system and encryption used to store plugins and data.Can exfiltrate data from air-gapped networks via USB devices.Leverages DNS and direct email connections for stealthy data exfiltration.Unique malware files per victim to avoid reuse of indicators.Infrastructure not reused either.Passive network sniffing tool inspects protocols like HTTP, SMTP, POP3, FTP to steal credentials.""Bus manager"" component steals documents from USB drives by hiding storage area.Attackers carefully studied other advanced groups and customized tactics to avoid past mistakes.Overall, the document provides an extensive review of ProjectSauron's technical sophistication, custom malware, infrastructure, and techniques for long-term stealthy intrusions."

"In May 2020, Kaspersky technologies prevented an attack on a South Korean company by a malicious script for Internet Explorer.Closer analysis revealed that the attack used a previously unknown full chain that consisted of two zero-day exploits - a remote code execution exploit for Explorer and an elevation of privilege exploit for Windows.Unlike a previous full chain used in Operation WizardOpium, the new full chain targeted the latest builds of Windows 10, and our tests demonstrated reliable exploitation of Internet Explorer 11 and Windows 10 build 18363 x64.The attacks, dubbed Operation PowerFall, relied on exploits for vulnerabilities CVE-2020-0674, CVE-2019-1429, and CVE-2018-8653 in the legacy JavaScript engine jscript.dll, which Microsoft released patches for in June 2020.The exploits were used to exploit vulnerabilities in jscript9.dll which has been used since at least Internet Explorer 9.The exploit uses a simple task to convert an object to a float pointer, which is then converted to a pointer to an object with a more complex task.When the object reaches out to a command and control server, it contacts the attacker's C2 server to receive commands and exfiltrate data.DarkHotel is suspected to be behind the attacks based on similarities in tactics, techniques, and procedures with previous activity by this threat actor.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, domains, IP addresses, and YARA rules to detect the attack.Kasperski products detect the attacks with PDM: Exploit.Win32.Generic.Exploit.exe, ExplorerExploit, and WindowsExploit.NET.exe.The attack leverages exploits from jScript.dll.dll to exploit the use-after-free vulnerability CVE-2022-1380, which was not covered by Microsoft patching.This shows how zero-days can be leveraged in targeted attacks.The patch was released on August 11, 2020.In summary, the report provides technical details on the technical details of how the exploits worked, the attack chain, and detection methods to detect and block the threat actors behind this campaign.It provides insights into the evolution of zero days used in targeted against the latest Windows 10 builds.","The PDF describes an attack called Operation PowerFall that exploited two zero-day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Windows.The attack targeted a South Korean company in May 2020 and was detected and prevented by Kaspersky technologies.The attack used a full exploit chain that consisted of: - A remote code execution exploit for a use-after-free vulnerability in Internet Explorer's JScript engine (CVE-2020-1380).This allowed arbitrary code execution in the context of the browser.- An elevation of privilege exploit for an arbitrary pointer dereference vulnerability in the Windows GDI Print/Print Spooler API (CVE-2020-0986).This allowed escaping the sandbox and executing code in splwow64.exe.The Internet Explorer exploit gained read/write access to the process's memory using corrupted JavaScript objects.It then bypassed Control Flow Guard to execute shellcode that loaded a DLL containing the Windows exploit.The Windows exploit achieved code execution in splwow64.exe with medium integrity.It executed an obfuscated PowerShell command to download a file called upgrader.exe which was prevented by Kaspersky.Kaspersky believes an APT group called DarkHotel may be behind the attack due to similarities with previous exploits, but definitive attribution is not possible.The attack demonstrates 0-day exploits being used in the wild against the latest Windows 10 versions."
"The report describes the takedown of a sophisticated ad fraud operation called 3ve that operated on a massive scale, controlling over 1 million IPs at its peak.3ve used a novel novel technique of operating as a proxy in user's PCs to redirect fraudulent ad traffic to its command and control servers.The operation started as a low-level botnet that evolved into a sophisticated botnet capable of generating billions of fraudulent ad bid requests.Researchers discovered 3ve's infrastructure was spread across thousands of servers across data centers and compromised homes.The botnets communicated with C2 servers using encrypted C2 protocols.The C2 communicated with a network of proxy servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data.Overlaps were found between the 3ve botnets and other commercial and government IP addresses used by other fraudsters.The report provides technical details on how 3ve operated, including its use of hidden Windows, mouse movements, tag evasion techniques, and geographic distribution.It also covers the evolution of its tactics, techniques, infrastructure, and procedures over time.The U.S. Department of Justice announced criminal charges against 3ve operators this week, but the report aims to raise awareness of the threat of ad fraud and the need for industry collaboration to combat it.The goal is to encourage collaboration across the digital advertising industry to take action against threats like 3ve and other sophisticated operations like it.","The document describes an investigation by Google and White Ops into a major online ad fraud operation called ""3ve"" that was taken down through industry collaboration.- 3ve was composed of three sophisticated botnets that each used different techniques to commit ad fraud at a massive scale, generating billions of fraudulent ad bid requests.- The botnets infected over 1 million IPs from residential computers and corporate networks to proxy their activities.They created over 10,000 counterfeit websites mimicking legitimate publishers to sell fake ad inventory.- 3ve.1 used malware infections and BGP hijacking to acquire proxy IPs.3ve.2 infected 700,000 computers via malvertising to power a custom browsing botnet.3ve.3 used IP addresses from data centers.- The botnets used advanced techniques to mimic human behavior and evade detection like fake mouse movements, randomized behaviors, anti-forensics scans, and blockchain mining scripts.- Google, White Ops and other security firms analyzed the operation and formed an industry working group.They observed the operators, mapped the infrastructure, and coordinated a takedown.- The takedown involved referral to law enforcement, infrastructure disruption, botnet sinkholing, and cooperation across ad tech, security firms, ISPs and hosting providers.It successfully rendered the 3ve botnets inactive.- The collaboration and actions taken aim to set a precedent to deter future large-scale ad fraud operations by imposing real consequences on the perpetrators.Continued industry cooperation is needed to protect the digital ad ecosystem."
"The document analyzes a new Poison Ivy remote access trojan (RAT) malware variant that was likely used in an extended campaign targeting India, Tibetans, and other countries from September 2014 to February 2015.Poison Ivy uses the dynamic DNS-provided C2 domain getstrings[.]jumpingcrab[.]com for command and control.The malware was created in September 2014 and uploaded to Virus Total in January 2015.It uses decoy documents containing PlugX decoys to deliver the malware and call-out to IP addresses.The decoys were reportedly used in a campaign identified by SOPHOS that spanned September 2014-February 2015, with India being a target.The Poison Ivy sample in this case appears to be tied to an Extended PlugX campaign likely conducted on behalf of Chinese interests.The intended target may have been one or more Japanese organizations, given that JPCERT was the first to dissect this PIVY sample.Or it may be used in attacks against other victims.The threat analysis examines Poison Ivy's new HTTP POST request and proxy functionality, which uses dynamic DNS and HTTP CONNECT requests for C2 communications.It also examines the infrastructure and timing overlaps between this campaign and previous ones, suggesting they were part of the same attack campaign.The report concludes that Poison Ivy and Links to PlugX are linked based on infrastructure overlaps and targeting aligning with previous activity by Chinese threat actors.It provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, C2 domains, and IP addresses associated with this campaign.","The report by CYINT Analysis examines a new variant of the Poison Ivy remote access trojan (RAT) identified by Japan CERT in September 2014.The Poison Ivy sample uses updated command and control capabilities and the domain getstrings[.]jumpingcrab[.]com, which has resolved to 3 different IP addresses.The report connects this Poison Ivy variant to an extended campaign from September 2014 - February 2015 that distributed PlugX malware using decoy documents targeting India, Tibetan communities, and other parties of interest to China.Some of the decoy documents use the same IP addresses as the Poison Ivy sample.A Sophos report on PlugX mentions attacks on India over the same September 2014 - February 2015 timeframe.The timing and infrastructure overlaps suggest the Poison Ivy sample was part of a broader 5-6 month campaign likely conducted by one or more Chinese state-sponsored groups.The report concludes that while anyone can acquire Poison Ivy, this particular variant appears tied to cyber espionage activity aligned with Chinese intelligence priorities, given the targeting, timing, infrastructure, and connections to PlugX."
"The document analyzes a cyberespionage campaign by a threat actor group called Kasablanka that is suspected to be targeting Russia.Kasablankas used socially engineered phishing emails with malicious virtual disk image files to distribute remote access trojans like Warzone RAT and Loda RAT.The files contained lnk files, zip files, executables, and executables that executed next-stage payloads.The lnks used topics related to Turkey, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia as lures.The executables connected to command and control servers in Morocco to receive commands and exfiltrate data.LodaRAT capabilities included keylogging, password stealing, remote desktop access, file exfiltration, and remote shell execution.The malware was written in C# and obfuscated so common tools could not decompress it.Analysis of the malware revealed it added spying capabilities to Android, including reverse proxy, VNC, and reverse proxy port hijacking.The vhdx files were uploaded from September-December 2022 and contained Russian language decoy content.Targets included the Russian Federal Government Cooperation Agency, Ministry of Foreign Communications, and Astrakhan Region Ministry.Some samples also intercepted a document related to Kyrgyzbaryzstan's draft digital code.The report provides technical details on the malware components, encryption schemes, command handling, and other technical details.It also includes indicators of compromise like file hashes, C2 servers, and YARA rules to detect the group's activities.In summary, the report analyzes the tactics, techniques, infrastructure, and attribution, and potential targets of this threat actor's campaign against Russia.It provides technical analysis to support detection and prevention of this actor.","The cybersecurity company QiAnXin discovered that the hacking group Kasablanka conducted campaigns targeting organizations in Russia between September and December 2022.The group sent phishing emails with.vhdx virtual hard disk files attached that contained malicious payloads.The emails posed as communications related to the Russian government and current events to encourage targets to open them.The virtual disk files contained lnk files, zip files, and executables that installed remote access Trojans like Warzone RAT and Loda RAT on target systems.Loda RAT was packed in an obfuscated executable over 700MB large.It could stealthily capture screenshots, keylogs, files, and other data.Warzone RAT connected to a command and control server to allow the attackers full remote control.Earlier versions embedded the RATs directly in the Word documents.Later versions hid them in image files downloaded by the initial scripts.The PowerShell code used string obfuscation techniques to avoid detection.QiAnXin believes the attackers aim to gather intelligence and conduct espionage.While Loda RAT was previously tied to Kasablanka, other groups could be copying its code.The targeting of Russian organizations and use of the Russian language/current events suggests a nation-state actor likely conducted this campaign.QiAnXin recommends updating software and not opening suspicious emails or files."
"The PDF describes a new data wiping malware called CryWiper that was used in attacks against Russian courts and government organizations in 2022.The malware is masquerading as ransomware but actually destroys data beyond recovery when it reaches out to a command and control server to generate ransom notes demanding payment.CryWipers is a Windows executable written in C++ that creates scheduled tasks to run every 5 minutes on compromised machines.It contacts the C2 server with the victim's machine name and contacts a ""run"" or ""do not run"" command, determining whether to activate the wiper.The wiper corrupts all files except for registry keys and files enumerated, rendering the system inoperable.It also delays execution by up to 4 days in some cases, likely to confuse the victim as to what caused the infection.The algorithm is based on a pseudorandom number generator.The data-wiping function is not a mistake, but a purposeful tactic to destroy targets' data.Even though not ransomware in the typical sense, it can still cause severe data destruction and business interruption.The report provides technical analysis of the malware's components, encryption schemes, command handling, and anti-analysis features.It does not appear associated with previous wiper malware like DoubleZero, IsaacWiper, or HermeticWiper.However, a report by Russian media says CryWiping was used to target Russian mayor's offices and courts.In summary, the report provides an in-depth analysis of a new, previously undocumented data wiping trojan malware that destroyed data in attacks on Russian targets, likely for financial gain rather than data protection.","The document describes a new data wiper malware called CryWiper that has been used in attacks against Russian organizations, including mayor's offices and courts.CryWiper was first discovered by Kaspersky in fall 2022 being used against a Russian entity.CryWiper masquerades as ransomware but is actually designed to permanently destroy data beyond recovery.It creates scheduled tasks to repeatedly run on compromised systems.It contacts a command and control server which can remotely activate the wiping process.CryWiper stops critical database and email services, deletes shadow copies, and modifies the registry to prevent remote access.It then corrupts files on the system while skipping certain directories and file types to avoid fully disabling the computer.After wiping files, it generates a fake ransom note demanding payment in Bitcoin to decrypt files, even though restoration is not possible.The wiping uses an algorithm called Mersenne Twister, distinct from other 2022 wipers like IsaacWiper.While not true ransomware, CryWiper can still cause severe data destruction and business disruption.It does not appear related to major 2022 wipers like WhisperGate and AcidRain that targeted Ukraine.CryWiper has been deployed against Russian entities, marking a change from wipers focused on Ukraine.In summary, CryWiper is a destructive new data wiper used in attacks on Russian mayor's offices and courts, masquerading as ransomware while making reliable data recovery impossible."
"The PDF describes research by Trend Micro on the threat actor group Tropic Trooper, which has been active since 2011 targeting government, military, healthcare, transportation, and high-tech industries in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong.TropicTrooper uses spear-phishing emails with weaponized attachments to exploit vulnerabilities and steal documents, primarily for information theft and espionage.The group has also adopted new tactics like nimble web-based malware and mobile surveillanceware.Trend Micro's analysis found Tropictrooper is now targeting Taiwanese and Philippine military networks through a new USB malware called USBferry, which is designed to exfiltrate sensitive data from air-gapped networks.The USB malware uses a fake executable decoy and USB trojan strategy to steal information.It has at least three versions, with different variants and components, at the time of writing.The first version checks if the target machine has USB ports and copies the malware installer into the USB storage.The second version combines the first and second versions into one executable.The third version retains the malware's stealth capabilities and improves its stealth in the target environment by residing in the rundll32.exe memory.The malware can execute commands, source target lists, copy files from compromised hosts, and move laterally in the environment.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, network domains, IP addresses, and other technical details on the USB malware components.It also covers detection methods like AV signatures, network signatures, and YARA rules.In summary, the PDF provides an in-depth look at the USB Trojan attack tactics, capabilities, infrastructure, and attribution, as well as recommendations for security controls to detect and defend against this persistent threat actor.","The PDF discusses attacks by a threat actor group called Tropic Trooper that targets government, military, and other organizations in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong.- Tropic Trooper has been active since at least 2011, using spear phishing and weaponized attachments to steal information.- Their latest campaign uses a type of USB malware called USBferry to target air-gapped networks of military and government organizations.- USBferry infects air-gapped systems by copying itself to USB devices that are then inserted into the isolated systems.It can collect files and data from the air-gapped system and transfer them out when the USB device is removed.- There are at least three versions of USBferry that have different capabilities for evading detection, executing commands, etc.The latest version resides in memory to hide itself.- Tropic Trooper first compromises related organizations like military hospitals to use as a jumping off point to get to the more secure air-gapped networks.- They have a variety of custom backdoors and tools to maintain access, communicate with compromised systems, scan networks, etc.Some use steganography to hide communications.- Recommendations include enforcing least privilege, keeping systems patched and updated, monitoring networks, and using security solutions that provide visibility and threat detection across the environment.Understanding the tactics and techniques of threat actors can help organizations better defend against targeted attacks."
"The report analyzes a mobile malware campaign called HummingBad that infects Android devices and generates $300,000 per month in fraudulent ad revenue.The group controls over 85 million devices globally and has been active since at least August 2015.Researchers gained unprecedented access to a group of cybercriminals in China who created the malware.The campaign shares infrastructure and tools with the Yingmob mobile ad server, which is associated with an iOS malware called Yispecter.Both install fraudulent apps to gain revenue.Analysis of the malware code revealed it sends notifications to a tracking and analytics service called Umeng, which manages the campaign.The control panel registers almost 200 apps, most of which are variations of the same core Android apps.The top 20 countries with the most infected devices are India, China, Ukraine, Russia, and the US, with nearly 10 million users using the malicious apps each.The report provides extensive technical details on how the malware and apps are developed, including the encryption schemes used, command and control infrastructure, encryption schemes, and installation methods.It also covers the evolution of Android malware from basic rootkits to sophisticated backdoors and backdoors.The threat actors behind the campaign share infrastructure, tools, and resources, allowing them to gain control of tens of millions of devices globally.This could allow them to create botnets, conduct targeted attacks, sell access to other criminals, or even sell the devices on the black market.Any data on these devices is at risk, including enterprise data on devices that serve dual purpose for end users and government agencies.The financial gain is just the tip of the iceberg.Emboldened by financial independence, the attackers' skillsets will advance further, putting end users, enterprises, and agencies at risk.The investigation uncovered critical insights into how attackers conduct mobile malware campaigns.","The report provides an in-depth analysis of HummingBad, a sophisticated malware campaign targeting Android devices.Researchers attribute the campaign to Yingmob, a Chinese mobile ad network company.Yingmob runs the malware operation alongside its legitimate ad business, sharing infrastructure and resources.This allows the malware campaign to infect over 85 million devices and generate $300,000 per month in fraudulent ad revenue.The malware uses rooting exploits and social engineering to gain system-level access on devices.It then installs fraudulent apps to create fake clicks and impressions.Yingmob tracks and manages the malware using a command and control platform.With control of over 85 million devices, Yingmob could potentially sell access to the highest bidder.The data and capabilities of compromised devices could be very valuable to cybercriminals.The report concludes by warning that as attackers become more independent and sophisticated like Yingmob, larger and more dangerous mobile malware campaigns will emerge.The findings highlight the increasing threat that mobile malware poses to both consumers and enterprises."
"The document provides an overview of the cyberespionage activities of a threat actor group called Naikon APT, which has been active since at least 2012 targeting organizations in Southeast Asia.The group uses spear-phishing emails with weaponized Office documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158 to deliver custom malware like the MsnMM backdoor, sslMM, xsControl/naikon, and plugins like rarstone for initial access and persistence.They also use a set of second-stage tools like a network and service scanner, PDF binding tool, and an exploit builder kit.Victims are found in Myanmar, Vietnam, Singapore, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, and other ASEAN countries.Infrastructure analysis suggests the group has been social engineeringing targets based on interests in current events, language, and previous communications.The report provides technical details on the group's tactics, techniques, and procedures over time, including the use of exploit kits, backdoors, phishing lures, custom malware, and infrastructure.It notes that the group appears to be a well-resourced, persistent threat actor that continuously evolves its tools and infrastructure to avoid detection.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at the evolution and tools used by the NaikON APT group in its campaigns, from initial access vectors like Office documents and exploits, to sophisticated malware development and use of custom tools for persistence and data exfiltration over time.","The document discusses the campaigns and tools used by a threat actor group referred to as the Naikon APT.This group has conducted cyber espionage campaigns targeting organizations in Southeast Asia, particularly ASEAN nations, since around 2009.The group has used various backdoors and malware tools over the years, many with ""MM"" in their names, such as MsnMM, WinMM, WininetMM.These tools have shared code, functionality, infrastructure, and targeting focuses.The group has relied heavily on spear-phishing to deliver its malware, using exploits for Microsoft Office and decoy documents relevant to its targets.The PDF examines the group's earliest campaigns, under the codename MsnMM, and traces the evolution of its tools over time.It provides technical analysis of malware samples like SslMM, WinMM, Inject, and Sakto/WininetMM.The group's later campaigns employed more sophisticated backdoors like Naikon/xsPlus and Rarstone.The report highlights the shared code, infrastructure, and targeting between the MsnMM and later Naikon campaigns.Both used the same exploit kit to generate malware.They shared domains and IP addresses for command and control.The spear-phishing content and decoys align with an ASEAN focus.Victim organizations have included government, military, law enforcement, media, and energy sector entities in Vietnam, Myanmar, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, and elsewhere.The report concludes the Naikon APT is a persistent, prolific cyber espionage actor focused on the South China Sea region."

"The PDF analyzes recent malware tools attributed to the Andariel APT group, a subgroup of the Lazarus cybercrime group, targeting South Korean entities.The initial report by Malwarebytes attributes the attack to the Lazarus group based on code similarities with previous activity.Kaspersky refines this attribution based on operational similarities found between the new and past attacks.The analysis focuses on the malware tooling, including code reuse and functional similarities between the packer, downloader, and RAT payloads.The tools are referred to as TigerDownloader and TigerRAT, named after the names of two malware families they studied in their research.While the tools fall into the same malware families, there are different variants of the tools which have been deployed in the reported attacks.Different versions have different capabilities like persistence, but the tools share code similarities suggesting they were used at different stages of the attack chain.The report also finds a new ransomware variant called TigerByteRAT deployed by Andariels, which they attribute to a previously unknown threat actor.This suggests the attacks may have been conducted by this group, which is known to employ custom tools and new techniques to increase effectiveness in cyberespionage campaigns.In summary, the report provides technical analysis of the malware tools used in the recent attacks on South Korea, their links to previous Lazarus Group activity, and recommendations for detection and prevention.It highlights the importance of threat intelligence to understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures of advanced persistent threat actors.","The report analyzes malware families called TigerRAT and TigerDownloader used in attacks on South Korean entities attributed to the Andariel APT group.It builds on previous research by Malwarebytes, Kaspersky, and the Korean CERT on these attacks.The report finds all malware samples are related through a common packing scheme, though the downloader and RAT families are code-wise distinct.It identifies 3 variants of the TigerRAT and 2 of the TigerDownloader through code reuse analysis.The TigerDownloader variants mainly differ in whether persistence is achieved.The TigerRAT variants differ more substantially in their command and control capabilities.But they share an interface for C2 commands and minor protocol differences, evidencing evolution of the malware.Enrichment of infrastructure links and C2s is provided to facilitate further research.The report concludes by mapping the malware capabilities to MITRE ATT&CK techniques across the full attack chain from infrastructure compromise to data exfiltration."
"The PDF describes a series of targeted mobile malware attacks targeting Android users in India by a hacking group called PoriewSpy that has been active since at least 2014.The group uses a custom Android malware framework called Android Image Viewer to create malicious apps that steal sensitive data from victims' devices like SMS, call logs, contacts, location data, and voice recordings.The apps were automatically downloaded from compromised websites and installed on the victim's device.Once installed, the apps record audio, take photos, read SMS messages, record calls, access contacts, read files, access Wi-Fi networks, and more.They can also turn the device into an audio recorder and steal other device info.Analysis suggests the operators behind these apps may be related to a suspected cyberespionage group known for targeting government entities in India.However, the group may be launching different attacks unrelated to their previous activity.The malware uses various techniques to evade detection, including: - Modifying an open-source Android image viewer to add permissions to steal data - Obfuscating call logs and SMS messages - Using a fake location provider app to hide its presence - Obscuring SMS messages and contacts from viewable devices The main espionage component connects to a command and control server to receive commands and exfiltrate data The apps can be downloaded from malicious sites hosted on compromised servers.The PDF provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, domains, IP addresses, and YARA rules to detect the malware.In summary, the PDF analyzes a new wave of targeted Android malware campaigns by a threat actor targeting Indian users with a custom, modular toolkit called Android image viewer.It provides technical details to help potential targets defend against such targeted by this group.","The PDF describes a malware campaign targeting Android users in India called PoriewSpy.It was discovered in late 2017 and is believed to be created by a hacking group previously known for targeting government officials.PoriewSpy is capable of recording audio, stealing contacts, SMS messages, call logs, location data, and other sensitive information from infected devices.It disguises itself as a nude photo app but then hides its icon.The malware turns the device into an audio recorder, secretly recording the user even when not on a call.The hackers also used separate malicious apps built with the DroidJack RAT that share command and control infrastructure with PoriewSpy.These apps masquerade as legitimate apps and request extensive permissions to fully control the device.The report analyzes the code of PoriewSpy and its evolution over time.It uncovers the IP addresses of the command and control servers, several of which were previously used by the suspected hacking group in cyberespionage campaigns.The PDF provides indicators of compromise and recommendations for mobile security solutions to detect and block similar malware.It highlights that targeted mobile malware attacks are rising and users should only install apps from trustworthy sources and be cautious of permissions requested."
"The document provides an overview of Kaspersky Security for Virtualization, a solution integrated with the VMware NSX security platform.It discusses how traditional private cloud security solutions are not flexible enough for virtualization and private cloud environments.This is because they are often tied to the hardware platform they are built on, making agility and agility difficult.By combining virtualization management with security policies on NSX, virtual machines (VMs) can receive granular protection across their private clouds.This provides visibility, control, and protection against threats like ransomware, malware, and network attacks.The solution is specifically designed to protect VMs running on VMware vSphere, Linux, and Windows systems.It uses agentless deployment of SVM appliances based on the security policies applied to each protected VM on the hypervisor.Integrations with NSX Security Tags and Infrastructure Scanning allow real-time threat detection across the private cloud.Full infrastructure scanning protects all VMs, whether they are on- or offline, for even better cybersecurity coverage across virtual infrastructure.This combines virtualization security with cloud-based endpoint protection to provide proactive defense against cyberthreats.The integrated security solution works well with other VMware products like NSX vCloud for vSphere.It saves time and reduces update and scanning cycles, while preserving virtualization ROI.The document provides in-depth technical analysis of the architecture, capabilities, and benefits of this solution.It emphasizes the importance of virtualization holistically, not just virtualization alone.","The document discusses the integration of Kaspersky Security for Virtualization with the VMware NSX platform to provide advanced security for software-defined data centers.Virtualization platforms like VMware NSX help data centers become more agile and dynamically configurable.However, traditional security solutions are not designed for these virtual environments and can impede performance and flexibility.The integrated Kaspersky-VMware solution allows unified orchestration and management of security policies across physical, virtual, and mobile endpoints.Key benefits include: - Automated deployment of security virtual machines (SVMs) based on policies applied to VMs on each hypervisor host.This provides granular security tailored to each VM's role.- Integration with NSX Security Tags lets the infrastructure automatically react and reconfigure in real-time in response to threats.- Agentless full infrastructure scanning, including offline VMs, eliminates gaps in security coverage.- Intelligent orchestration of scanning eliminates resource consumption peaks and disruption.- No downtime for VM reboot or server maintenance required for deployment.- Single console for managing consistent security across the hybrid infrastructure.- Utilizes VMware native capabilities for maximum interoperability and performance.In summary, the integrated solution allows software-defined data centers to implement elastic, automated security that is tailored to their needs, without impacting efficiency or agility.The native VMware-Kaspersky integration brings security into the software-defined infrastructure."
"The document describes the discovery of Android spyware called Hermit that was used in a targeted campaign against the government of Kazakhstan in April 2022.Hermit is believed to be developed by Italian spyware vendor RCS Lab and a front company Tykelab Srl, which may be operating as a telecommunications company.The malware was distributed via SMS messages impersonating legitimate mobile applications like Oppo, Samsung, and Vivo.Analysis shows Hermit has modular components that allow it to exploit a rooted device, record audio, make calls, and collect extensive data from the device including contacts, messages, location, and SMS messages.The modules communicate with a command and control server at 85.159.27.8442.The real C2 IP address is administered by STS Telecom, a small internet service provider (ISP) operating out of Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan.This deployment suggests an entity of the Kazakhstan government is likely behind Hermit, making it the first known case of a current customer being identified using this malware.Prior to detecting the Kazakhstan samples, Lookout had seen Hermit used in previous campaigns against targets in Syria, Italy, and other countries in the region.Lookout Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) was able to detect and respond to Hermit using machine learning and advanced threat detection techniques.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, network IOCs, and YARA rules to detect Hermit.In summary, the document provides an in-depth look at the Hermit spyware used in the Kazakhstan campaign, its capabilities, infrastructure, and connections to known and unknown threat actors in the mobile surveillance market.","The report analyzes an Android spyware named Hermit that was used to target victims in Kazakhstan and elsewhere.Hermit is developed by Italian surveillance vendor RCS Lab and a front company called Tykelab.Hermit is modular malware that downloads additional capability modules from its command and control server after initial infection.It can record audio, intercept notifications, steal data like contacts and photos, and more.Samples were found impersonating smartphone manufacturers to trick users into installing Hermit.The malware displays legitimate websites as it starts malicious background activities.In April 2022, Hermit was found targeting Kazakhstan in the wake of anti-government protests being suppressed.The command and control IP tied back to an ISP in the capital.Prior infections were seen in Syria and Italy.The report examines RCS Lab's controversial global spyware dealings with authoritarian regimes.Technical analysis reveals Hermit's advanced capabilities like device exploitation, encrypted communications, configurable parameters, and steps to evade detection and analysis.The report concludes that spyware like Hermit poses a powerful threat, but can be defeated through awareness, application vetting, device hygiene, and dedicated mobile security solutions.In summary, the report provides an in-depth profile of the sophisticated Hermit spyware, its developers, infection tactics, and use in targeted surveillance operations globally."
"Avast researchers have analyzed a backdoor malware called Roshtyak used by the Raspberry Robin worm.Raspberry Robin spreads through removable drives and has been active since at least May 2022.The malware is packed in as many as 14 protective layers, each heavily obfuscated and serving a specific purpose.The layers contain anti-analysis, anti-sandbox, and anti-VM checks sprinkled throughout the layers.If one of these checks successfully detects an analysis environment, one of four actions are taken.The first one is to call TerminateProcess on itself to avoid exhibiting malicious behavior and to keepthe subsequent layers encrypted.The second is to decrypt and load a fake payload.The third is to crash the system.The fourth is to load and execute the real payload.There are two encrypted global variables in the data section of the global variable variable which are used to modify the global value of the encrypted global variable used in the analysis.The analysis shows the layers were originally PE files but were transformed into custom encrypted structures that only the previous layers know how to decrypt.This demonstrates how sophisticated malware can be, and Avast hopes this will help other researchers recognize and respond to similar tricks, and harden their analysis environments to make them more resistant.","The PDF discusses the malware Raspberry Robin, specifically focusing on its heavily protected DLL backdoor called Roshtyak.Roshtyak employs numerous advanced anti-analysis techniques to avoid detection, including anti-debugger, anti-sandbox, anti-VM, and anti-emulation checks.If any check succeeds in detecting the analysis environment, Roshtyak will terminate itself, crash intentionally, enter an infinite loop, or execute fake adware payload.The fake payload tricks analysts into thinking the malware is harmless.Roshtyak's code is heavily obfuscated through control flow flattening, function activation keys, variable masking, and other techniques.It is packed in up to 14 layers, each serving a specific protective purpose.The obfuscation hinders static analysis.The core functionality of Roshtyak is to establish persistence, escalate privileges, move laterally, and download additional payloads.The malware uses encrypted kernel exploits to escalate privileges, which are decrypted on demand.Roshtyak downloads PsExec on demand from a specific URL and drops it into a temporary directory under a random name.The payload to be executed by PsExec is a self-extracting package created by a tool called IExpress, which is an ancient Windows installer.It profiles victims by collecting system information and exfiltrating it to C2 servers over Tor.The servers can respond with new shellcode for execution.Reverse engineering Roshtyak is very challenging due to the combination of heavy obfuscation and numerous advanced anti-analysis tricks.The PDF aims to help fellow researchers recognize and respond to similar malware tricks, and harden analysis environments against the described evasion techniques."
"The PDF provides an analysis of the infostealer malware used in the ongoing Middle Eastern cyberespionage campaign called Madi that has targeted victims in Iran, Israel, Afghanistan, and other countries.The malware is installed via downloaders that use social engineering techniques to trick users into enabling macros that drop a fake file named ""UpdateOffice.exe"" into the ""Printhood"" folder.The downloaders also drop files that assist the malware when connecting to the command and control server.The analysis examines the installation process - the downloaders create fake files with random names in their respective folders.Only one file, nam.dll, will be used by the infOSTealer, which is created by the downloader in the ""Templates"" directory (e.g.: ""C:Documents and Settings%USER%Templatesnam.dll"") and contains a BOTID/build that is later used when connected to the C&C server.To download and install the malware, the downloaded downloaders connect to an HTM page that contains a double BASE64 encoded executable embedded in the page, decode the Base64 payload, save the resulting PE file as ""iexplore.exe"", and then execute it.The version used in this analysis, which appears to be compiled on 10 June 2012, is packed using UPX 3.08.The first activity of interest happens inside TForm4.FormCreate.exe, which starts with the setup of a keylogger.After the keylogging happens in TFormCreate folder, the infstealer reads the ""botid_TMP"" file which contains some numbers derived from the ""C:"" Volume Serial Number.The following timers are disabled in specific order: Timer1, Timer16, timer3, timestamps, Timers4, timers5, and Timer6.Timer7.Timers are used to receive commands from the command server.There is heavy use of Delphi in this campaign, with 52 versions written in Delphi.Many bugs were found, some of which won't be discussed here as we don't want to help the authors improve their malware.In order to avoid confusion, the analysis looks for the following files: 1.Iexplore.dll which looks for files referring to the malware directories, 2.IExplore.databank.exe which searches for files in the temp directory, and 3.IExfiltrate.datastore.","The document analyzes the ""Madi"" malware campaign that has infected over 800 victims primarily in the Middle East by targeting Iran, Israel, and Afghanistan.- The malware is delivered via spearphishing emails containing malicious PDF attachments that install the malware if opened.- Two main components are installed - a dropper and a data-stealing module.The malware uses 52 timers to control its activities.- It captures keystrokes, screens, audio, scans drives, and exfiltrates documents and files back to its command and control servers.The data is encrypted and encoded.- The malware tracks infections via campaign IDs and logs system info like IP, OS, and machine name.It uses social engineering and fake files to avoid detection.- The coding techniques are basic and bugs exist, indicating amateur developers.But the campaign has still successfully compromised many targets.- Non-working features suggest the ability to generate new malware executables was being developed.The malware continues to be active and monitored.- While unsophisticated, the malware is effective at stealing data from infected systems.Low-tech malware remains a threat and this campaign in particular has had high success rates despite its simplicity.In summary, the document analyzes an active, low-tech but effective malware campaign targeting the Middle East that is stealing data from compromised systems."
"The document analyzes malware samples from Talos' incoming sample feeds/malware zoo and Cisco's Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) data sets.It finds that some malware samples were submitted months before they were officially labeled as part of an advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign.This suggests the malware authors directly interacted with the sandbox during the development phase of the threats.The analysis examines 10 APT campaigns from 2010-2015 that were publicly reported on by different security firms, showing different levels of sophistication and different objectives.The campaigns targeted organizations globally, not just in the US.Talos found that some samples were mislabeled as non-APT malware and not properly associated with the proper APT group.This shows the threat actors were able to connect the dots and attribute the attacks to APT groups before the proper attribution date was publicly disclosed.The report concludes that attribution is an open problem as the attackers remain unknown even after months of work by security researchers.However, Talos and Cisco products can be used to automatically discover new APT malware from public data sets like the Anubis sandbox.This makes attribution easier.Overall, the analysis provides insight into how security vendors can automatically attribute malware campaigns to specific threat actors based on public reporting dates rather than waiting for specific malware samples to be publicly disclosed before making a definitive attribution.The findings highlight the importance of rapid, accurate attribution of malware samples and links between threat actors.","The PDF is a blog post by Cisco Talos describing their analysis of past APT malware campaigns in their threat intelligence datasets.They looked at 10 major APT campaigns made public between 2010-2015, including campaigns like Aurora, Equation, Red October etc.Attribution is not discussed.They searched for these malware samples in the Talos malware zoo (feeds from AV companies, researchers etc.)and found samples for most campaigns existed in their zoo months or years before public disclosure of the APT campaigns.On average, it took 458 days after initial detection for samples to be publicly tied to an APT campaign.The gap was as high as 3 years for Equation samples.Analysis of VirusTotal submitters showed certain entities had submitted samples from multiple campaigns, indicating possible links between campaigns or actors.In the Cisco AMP customer telemetry, they found pre-dated samples related to 3 campaigns.Most were detected as malicious when first seen, but some evaded initial detection.The post concludes that while detection happens quickly, connecting samples to campaigns takes longer due to high volumes of generic malware.Sandbox evasion also delays detection.Their findings validate that threat actors submit samples to test defenses prior to attacks.Better analytics are needed to identify and correlate samples early to discover stealthy campaigns in progress."
"The document describes a large-scale cyberespionage campaign targeting renewable energy and industrial technology organizations that has been active since at least 2019.The campaign was discovered by security researcher William Thomas, who employed OSINT techniques like DNS scans and sandbox submissions to uncover the attacker's infrastructure.The attacker uses a custom ""Mail Box"" toolkit, an unsophisticated phishing package deployed on the actors' infrastructure, as well as legitimate websites compromised to host phishing pages.The phishing campaign's goal is to steal the login credentials of those working for renewable energy firms, environmental protection organizations, and in general.Examples of organizations targeted include Schneider Electric, CEZ Electro, California Air Resources Board, Taiwan Forestry Research Institute, and Sorema, an Italian recycling firm.The researcher believes the adversary is financially supported by entities interested in fossil fuels, particularly someone selling energy to Bulgaria who sees renewables as a threat.The previous targeting of banks could be an attempt to gather intelligence on the funding and construction of new renewable energy facilities.Unknown actor Thomas couldn't attribute this campaign to any specific actors, but evidence points to two clusters of activity, one from APT28 (aka FancyBear) and one from Konni (North Korea).The hostnames used for phishing credentials are owned by Zetta Hosting Solutions, a name that has appeared in many analyst reports recently.However, the researcher underlined that many APT hacking groups use Zetta in malicious campaigns.""Zetta is used a lot by APT and malware, and I'd be very surprised if they didn't know.Threat actors also like these types of free hostname services where they can setup infrastructure quickly, freely, and anonymously.""- Thomas.Since mid-Dec, @Google TAG has detected ongoing APTs28 phishing campaigns targetingUkraine.Some IOCs: consumerpanel.eu3[.]biz consumerpanel panel.rv.eu2[.]org consumerpanel consumerpanel panels.eu4[.]com Protectpanel.u3.biz protectservicecenter.blogspot.net.The link between this campaign and the particular Russian group T28 is not proven, even if it's not proven directly.","The PDF describes a large-scale cyberespionage campaign targeting renewable energy and industrial technology organizations that has been active since at least 2019.The campaign was discovered by security researcher William Thomas using OSINT techniques.The attackers use a custom 'Mail Box' phishing toolkit and compromised websites, mainly in Brazil, to host phishing pages impersonating organisations in the renewable energy sector.The goal is to steal login credentials of employees at these firms.Over 15 entities worldwide have been targeted so far, including companies like Schneider Electric, Honeywell, universities, and renewable energy facilities.The researcher could not conclusively attribute the campaign to a specific threat actor but found possible links to APT28 and Konni groups.There is an overlap with infrastructure used by both groups.The campaign has a focus on Bulgaria, targeting several banks in 2019.The researcher speculates the adversary may be financially supported by fossil fuel interests who see renewable energy as a threat.The previous bank targeting could have been to gather intelligence on funding of new renewable facilities.While not proven, APT28's links to Russia provide a logical basis for this theory, as Bulgaria imports Russian natural gas.In summary, this ongoing cyberespionage campaign is targeting the renewable energy sector, likely to steal intelligence to benefit fossil fuel interests threatened by clean energy adoption.Attribution is unclear but tactics and infrastructure analysis suggests potential APT28 or Konni involvement."
"The PDF analyzes a malware campaign by the threat actor group Goblin Panda that targeted the telecom industry in Russia using a variant of the Sisfader remote access trojan (RAT).Goblin Panda used the same techniques as another group called SisFader RAT to target the telecom sector, including exploiting CVE-2017-11882 and exploiting a vulnerability in a Russian telecom company's software.The malware payload is a modified version of the Ole Object RAT that has been studied by NCC Group.It overwrites the COM object and runs a runPE after overwriting in memory the malicious executable EQNEDT32.exe.The loop of decrypting and anti-emulation tricks match the code from the NCC group version.The persistence mechanism is the same with a service creation just after dropping di erents and a privilege escalation.The toolset for exploiting the vulnerability is similar to the one used by Goblin Panda (APT 1937CN) to target telecom firms in Russia.The infrastructure analysis shows domains associated with the campaign were registered with the Russian Federal Security Service for the FSB.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, domains, IP addresses, and YARA rules to detect this activity.It demonstrates Goblin Panda's continued focus on compromising Russian telecoms and infrastructure.The attacks demonstrate the group's persistence and adaptability.The PDF concludes that Goblin Panda continues to evolve its tactics, techniques, and procedures to target organizations in Russia and beyond.","The article analyzes two RTF malware documents that exploit CVE-2017-11882 to deliver a remote access trojan payload.The RTFs use the same exploitation techniques but deliver different payloads than past Goblin Panda activity targeting Vietnam officials.Analysis shows the payload is a version of the SisFader RAT, which uses anti-emulation and encryption techniques similar to past Goblin Panda malware.Infrastructure links the activity to Goblin Panda APT group and the SisFader RAT.The C2 domains resolve to IP addresses in Shanghai.Unlike past targeting of Vietnam, this campaign targeted Russian telecom firms pretending to be Russia's FSB intelligence agency.Goblin Panda has evolved their techniques from prior SisFader RAT analysis and continues to target telecom sectors aligned with intelligence collection goals.Indicators of compromise for the malware documents, C2 infrastructure, and RAT payload are provided.In summary, the post analyzes a Goblin Panda campaign distributing an updated version of the SisFader remote access trojan via exploitation of Russian telecom entities.It highlights the evolving techniques and targeting of this Chinese threat actor."
"Mandiant Managed Defense identified cyber espionage activity by a threat actor they track as UNC4191 targeting organizations primarily in Southeast Asia, extending to the U.S., Europe, and APJ.The initial infection vector is USB devices, followed by legitimate signed binaries to side-load malware.Successful compromise led to the deployment of a renamed NCAT binary and execution of a reverse shell on the victim's system, providing backdoor access to the threat actor.The malware self-replicates by infecting new removable drives that are plugged into a compromised system, allowing the malicious payloads to propagate to additional systems and potentially collect data from air-gapped systems.Mandiant identified three new malware families called MISTCLOAK, DARKDEW, and BLUEHAZE.These include a launcher written in C++ that executes encrypted executables, a dropper that infects removable drives, and a downloader that connects to a command and control server.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, network IOCs, and YARA rules to detect this activity.It assesses that UNC2191 has a China nexus and has affected a range of public and private sector entities primarily in the Philippines, with a focus on government, military, and commercial entities.In response, Mandiant deployed new real-time detections to enhance protection for customers from future similar activity by identifying new tactics, techniques, and procedures that can evade traditional detection mechanisms.","The PDF describes a cyberespionage campaign called UNC4191 that targeted organizations primarily in Southeast Asia, as well as some in the US, Europe, and Asia Pacific.The threat actor has a suspected China nexus.Initial infection vectored used USB devices.Malicious binaries named USB Drive.exe or Removable Drive.exe were executed by users when plugging in compromised USB drives.The binaries sideloaded and executed the malware MISTCLOAK, DARKDEW, and BLUEHAZE.MISTCLOAK decrypts and executes DARKDEW from an encrypted file on the USB drive.DARKDEW self-replicates by infecting any new USB drives plugged into the compromised system.It steals data from air-gapped systems this way.BLUEHAZE uses a signed binary to sideload itself.It opens a reverse shell to a command and control server using NCAT.Successful compromise allows the threat actor to maintain persistent access and carry out intelligence collection.The campaign appears to have started around September 2021 based on compile timestamps of the malware samples.New detections were created in Managed Defense to identify this activity, enabling rapid response.Indicators of compromise are provided.Mandiant will continue monitoring the campaign and provide updates on changes in TTPs or new tools."
"The PDF describes an analysis by Sentinelone researchers of malware samples attributed to the Sofacy APT group, also known as FancyBear or APT28.Sofacy has been active since 2008 and targets governments, military, and private organizations, primarily in former Soviet states and Asia.In March 2021, Sentinelone observed Sofacy activity targeting Kazakhstan with malware written in Delphocy, a Delphi-based dropper written by Zebrocy.The Word documents purport to be from a Kazakh mining company Kazchrome and contain macros that drop a PE file.By reverse engineering the macros, the researchers were able to bypass password-protected macros and decompile Delphi using IDR (Interactive Delphi Reconstructor) and Ghidra using dhrake's plugin.This allowed them to import the IDC file from the IDR output into Ghidr to decrypt and decode the malware.The analysis led to further discovery of additional Sofacy clusters, IOCs, and YARA rules to help threat hunters hunt for these and related artifacts in their environments.In summary, the PDF provides an in-depth look at how researchers can reverse engineer and analyze malware from Sofacy's Dropper Docs using techniques like HxD, PE-Bear, and IDR.It demonstrates how threat hunters can leverage these techniques to understand and reverse engineer Delphi droppers written by the notorious Sofacy group.The research demonstrates how organizations can work together to detect and defend against this persistent threat.","The PDF analyzes recent malware documents used by the APT group Zebrocy to target organizations in Kazakhstan.Zebrocy is a subgroup of the Sofacy cyberespionage group.- Six Word documents purporting to be from a Kazakh company contained VBA macros that drop malware.Two were likely real spearphishing documents.- The VBA macros were password-protected, but could be reversed to find base64 encoded malware.This decoded to a Delphi executable called wininition.- Wininition contains keylogging functionality that logs keystrokes to be sent to a command and control server.The C2 URLs were obfuscated with hex encoding.- The researcher demonstrates how to decompile the malware using Interactive Delphi Reconstructor (IDR) and import the results into Ghidra using the dhrake plugin.This reconstructions Delphi symbol names and class structures.- Analysis revealed additional related Zebrocy activity, suggesting the group is actively targeting Central Asia.Indicators of compromise and YARA rules are provided to help detect this threat.- The report highlights techniques to analyze Zebrocy's malware documents, which use Evade macros and Delphi malware.Ongoing research is required to counter this adaptable subgroup as part of the formidable Sofacy APT."
"The document analyzes a new malware family called VERMIN that has been used in targeted attacks against Ukraine since late 2015.VERMIN is written in Microsoft.NET and uses the Quasar RAT (Remote Access Tool) malware, which has been linked to previous cyberespionage campaigns.The malware uses the ConfuserEx and QuasarRAT malware families for command and control.The analysis starts with a tweet from a fellow researcher that led to the discovery of the malware samples.Using AutoFocus, pivoting on artifacts created during a sandbox run, and other tools like Maltego, the researchers were able to build a timeline of activity spanning over 2 years of malware samples and infrastructure.This timeline shows the campaign has focused on Ukraine, with nearly all the malware targeting the country's Ministry of Defense.Analysis of the infrastructure revealed a modestly sized campaign going back to late 2015, with a focus on Ukraine-themed malware and a limited number of victims.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, domains, IP addresses, and YARA rules to detect the malware and associated infrastructure.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at the VERMIN malware family, its targeting, infrastructure, and links to other malware families used in cyber espionage campaigns against Ukraine over the past few years.It highlights the ongoing threat of targeted attacks and evolution of malware like VERMIN.","Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 has discovered a new malware family written using the Microsoft.NET Framework which the authors call “VERMIN”; an ironic term for a RAT (Remote Access Tool).Cursory investigation into the malware showed the attackers not only had flair for malware naming, but also for choosing interesting targets for their malware: nearly all the targeting we were able to uncover related to activity in Ukraine.Pivoting further on the initial samples we discovered, and their infrastructure, revealed a modestly sized campaign going back to late 2015 using both Quasar RAT (url and VERMIN.This blog shows the links between the activity observed, a walkthrough of the analysis of the VERMIN malware, and IOCs for all activity discovered."
"The document analyzes a previously unknown backdoor malware developed by the Iron cybercrime group, the same group behind the Iron ransomware.Iron has been active for over a year and has developed various types of malware for Windows, Linux, Android and iOS platforms.They have successfully infected at least a few thousand victims.The backdoor was developed using leaked source code from HackingTeam's leaked RCS source code.It uses anti-VM and virtual machine detection code from the leaked ""Soldier"" implant.It injects malicious Chrome extensions to inject crypto-mining and payment hijacking scripts from the attacker's Pastebin account.The malware checks if the VM is running, runs in the background, and installs itself as a service for persistence.It checks for the presence of either Safe Guard or Safe Guard 360 on the system before installing itself.The installer is protected with VMProtect then compressed using UPX.It drops and installs the backdoor dll to the system and creates a service called ""helpsvc"" pointing back to the Iron Backdoor dll.Analysis shows the backdoor is partially based on leaked HacksTeam source code for Remote Control System hacking tools like IronStealer and IronPDF.It also uses the DynamicCall module from the core library used to dynamically call external functions by obfuscating the function name, making static analysis more complex.The CryptoNoter module in the Chrome extension injects the in-browser crypto mining module, while the payment-hacking module hijacks the browser's browser payment system.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, OS versions, C2 domains, and IP addresses associated with the malware.It concludes that Iron has successfully compromised thousands of victims over the past year and a half.Their continued development of ransomware and anti-virus tools shows they are a sophisticated threat actor that continues to actively targeting victims worldwide.","The report analyzes malware developed by an Iranian cybercrime group called Iron.The group has been active for around 18 months and has created backdoors, crypto-miners, and ransomware for Windows, Linux, and Android.Researchers discovered a new Iron backdoor using leaked HackingTeam source code.The backdoor installs the Xagent crypto-miner worm or Iron ransomware onto systems.It also steals cryptocurrency wallet files and hijacks crypto transactions.The malware uses a signed Chrome extension for stealthy crypto-mining and payment hijacking.It abuses HackingTeam anti-VM checks and dynamic function calling to avoid detection.The attackers used a network of Pastebin pastes for C2.Based on forum links and Chinese language artifacts, Iron is suspected to be a Chinese group.While not the most advanced actor, the rapid development across platforms shows the group's capabilities and business model.The report includes full technical analysis and indicators of compromise."
"The document provides an in-depth analysis of the modular malware framework used by the threat actor group Red October to conduct second stage cyberespionage campaigns.The main Sputnik module implements a framework for executing tasks provided by its C&C servers.Most tasks are performed as PE DLLs that are received from the server, executed in memory, and then discarded.Persistent tasks include searching for files on USB drives, searching directories, retrieving files by mask, and retrieving deleted files.Deleted files are restored using a file system parser.Wait for an iPhone or Nokia phone to connect, retrieve information about the infected device, its phone book, contacts, SMS messages, browsing history, etc.Infection starts with a specially crafted Microsoft Office document pretending to be a PDF or Office document.This executes a malicious payload that establishes a covert channel of communication to restore control of the infected machine.Modules are used to gather system info, scan for other hosts on the network, fingerprint other hosts, and exfiltrate data like contacts, calendars, files, and SMS messages.Some modules are designed to steal credentials from various sources like Outlook, Yahoo, and Yahoo Reader.Other modules gather system information, build directory lists, search directories, and retrieve files from FTP servers.A module called GReAT is used to install a backdoor on target devices.The backdoor gathers keystrokes, screenshots, keylogging data, and other sensitive data.It can be used to restore lost access and restore full control of infected machines.Additional modules are delivered via scheduled tasks and network scans.Red October uses a modular framework with modular components for persistence, data exfiltration, credential theft, network scanning, and spreading across networks.The modular framework allows Red October actors to rapidly deploy new malware while maintaining access to compromised systems.The report provides indicators of compromise and MITRE ATT&CK techniques to detect infections.It demonstrates the sophisticated capabilities of Red October's modular framework.","The PDF describes the second stage of attack used by the Red October malware.Red October is modular malware that is delivered in stages.The first stage gathers reconnaissance on the infected system.The second stage deploys additional modules that steal data, spread the malware, and maintain persistence.The second stage modules are either persistent, running continuously to wait for certain events like a mobile phone connecting, or one-time tasks that run once and collect specific data.Persistent tasks include stealing files from connected USB drives, stealing data from connected phones, spreading via the MS08-067 vulnerability, and more.One-time tasks gather system info, build directory listings, extract browsing history, collect application data, steal Outlook data, and more.The modules are organized into groups based on functionality like reconnaissance, password stealing, email theft, USB infection, spreading, and exfiltration.The modules gather data, encrypt it, and exfiltrate it to command and control servers.The configuration data reveals the command servers and paths used.In summary, the second stage of Red October is modular, persistent malware that builds on the reconnaissance of the first stage to steal data, spread, and maintain control of the infected system.The modular architecture allows the attackers to customize the malware by deploying only certain modules as needed for their goals."

"The document analyzes the threat of the MedusaLocker ransomware, which emerged in September 2019 and has been used in attacks against multiple industries, especially the healthcare industry, since it targeted COVID-19 pandemic victims.The ransomware uses a combination of AES and RSA encryption, making brute forcing brute forcing impossible.It encrypts shared network drives of adjacent machines on the network and attempts to extort money by threatening to publicly reveal stolen data if payments are not made.Cybereason detects and prevents the ransomware using their machine-based threat detection system.The analysis provides an in-depth breakdown of the attack process, including the use of a batch script, Powershell script, registry keys, and Windows Service for persistence.The batch script creates persistence via a service and runs a malicious binary encoded with base64 and AES.The MedusaPhell script checks if a process exists on the system and mutexes if it does not, rendering the ransomware unusable.It achieves this by leveraging the Windows tool CMACSTPASS BYPASS to execute arbitrary commands and UAC bypass by hijacking the User Account Control process.The ransom note content contains threats of publicly releasing stolen files if the ransom is not paid.While some ransom notes contain blackmail threats, there was no evidence of data leak threats being actually exfiltrated.The report assesses the threat level as high severity based on the combination of encryption techniques, high likelihood of success with safe mode restarting, and high destructive potential.This highlights the need for security controls and monitoring to detect and prevent such advanced persistent threat actors.","The document analyzes the MedusaLocker ransomware which first emerged in September 2019 and has targeted organizations across industries, including healthcare.MedusaLocker uses various techniques to maximize chances of successful encryption: Restarts machine in safe mode to avoid security products.Avoids encrypting executables to maintain system operability.Uses AES and RSA-2048 encryption.Threatens data leak extortion in ransom notes It uses a batch script and PowerShell loader to gain persistence and elevation.It terminates processes and disables services of security products.It deletes backups and shadow copies to prevent recovery.After infecting a system, it scans the subnet for other machines and shares to propagate.The ransomware avoids encrypting certain whitelist folders.It leaves a ransom note threatening data leak extortion but no exfiltration was observed.Detection and prevention of the ransomware is demonstrated using Cybereason's Anti-Ransomware feature and Powershell protection.The Mitre ATT&CK framework is used to map the ransomware's tactics.Indicators of Compromise and hashes for the ransomware executables, batch script, and PowerShell loader are provided.The threat level is assessed as high due to the ransomware's destructive potential."
"The report analyzes malware used by the FIN7 cybercrime group to spread a remote access trojan (RAT) called IceBot on USB devices.FIN7 used an Arduino sketch file called ""sketch_jul31a.ino"" as part of their ""BadUSB"" attacks.The sketch contains source code for an Arduino program that executes a PowerShell script to download and install the IceBot RAT payload from an IP address 206.230.190.The RAT allows FIN7 to gain unauthorized remote access to infected systems and exfiltrate data.Analysis of the IP address revealed 9 IP addresses that host FIN7’s malicious payloads and 3 FIN7 command-and-control servers.The C2 servers have a control panel showing infected systems.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, network IOCs, and YARA rules associated with FIN7's infrastructure.It notes that FIN7 continues to adapt and expand their tactics, techniques, and procedures to evade detection.The research aims to raise awareness of their tactics and enable better detection and prevention of similar attacks.","The cybercrime group FIN7 has been using ""BadUSB"" attacks to spread malware.They distribute USB devices containing malicious Arduino sketches that act as keyboards.When plugged in, the sketch executes PowerShell to download and install the IceBot remote access trojan (RAT).This allows FIN7 to gain unauthorized access to target networks.Analysis of the sketch code shows it opens a hidden PowerShell window to download the trojan from IP addresses linked to FIN7.The RAT then connects to FIN7 command and control servers.A control panel was discovered showing systems infected with IceBot, including info like IP, OS, antivirus, and options to interact with the RAT.This attack method avoids firewalls and email filters by not transmitting malware over the network.Encoding and scripts minimize malware files for stealth.FIN7 recently created a fake security company potentially to construct trojanized USBs.They may be using unwitting admins or sending them to clients for social engineering.The USB-based attack represents an evolution in tactics for FIN7 to gain persistent access and evade protections as they expand into ransomware operations.Defenses should focus on physical media controls and monitoring for suspicious USB activities."
"The PDF describes a malware campaign targeting Ukraine that uses a modified version of the GoMet backdoor written in the Go programming language.The malware was likely developed by Russian state-sponsored actors to target a software development company whose software is used by Ukrainian state organizations.The attackers exploited a vulnerability in Sophos Firewall to drop the malware.The backdoor is written in Go and supports various functions like command execution, file downloads, uploads, and opening shells.It can also daisy chain to gain access to multiple compromised hosts on the same network.The initial infection vector is similar to previous campaigns deploying GoMet after exploiting public vulnerabilities like CVE-2020-5902 and CVE-2022-1040.However, Cisco Talos has no reason to believe these cases are related to the usage of this backdoor in Ukraine.The original GoMet code was posted on GitHub in March 2019 and had commits until April 2019.It did not add any features but did fix some code convention aesthetics.The objective of the cron job defined in the main part of the malware is to check if it's connected to the command and control server (C2) if not, and then start the agent component again and connect to the C2.The author changed the original code to execute once every hour on the hour, making the sample more noisy but also preventing an hour-long sleep if the connection fails, which would allow more aggressive reconnection to the c2.Agent.start routine is done, the next cron jobs trigger the execution of the serve() routine and different configuration files.The main function is an example of a Windows update that included a scheduled tasks query.This allows the malware to create scheduled tasks for persistence.In one case, the malware used a novel novel approach of opening svtask queries rather than opening the system and opening a shell, which could potentially hinder forensic analysis or forensic forensic analysis.In another case, a blank svtask query was opened before the system was opened and then the malware executed by opening the svtask process and opening svinfo.info file.This approach avoids forensic detection by opening svslser queries and searching svinfo instead.The campaign likely originated from Russia and targeted a software company involved in software development in Ukraine, likely to gain initial access to source code for supply chain attacks.The company is involved in cyber espionage and supply chain compromise.While the threat actor's intent is unclear, the end goal appears to be espionage rather than supply chain compromises.In summary, the attackers used a modified GoMet","The PDF discusses the use of a backdoor called GoMet to target a large Ukrainian software development company since the start of Russia's invasion.GoMet is an open-source backdoor written in Go that provides remote access capabilities.Though the threat actor is unknown, Cisco Talos assesses the campaign is likely by Russian state-sponsored groups or those aligned with their interests.As the targeted company makes software used across Ukrainian state organizations, the attackers may intend to compromise the supply chain.The PDF analyzes GoMet's functionality like command execution, file operations, and daisy chaining to other systems.It highlights modifications made to the public GoMet code in this campaign, like more aggressive reconnecting.Details are provided on the malware's activity, including fake Windows updates and novel persistence by replacing existing autorun values.The IP address 111.90.139[.]122 was identified as the hardcoded command and control server.The PDF concludes by emphasizing the variety of cyber threats facing Ukraine and the determination of Russia-aligned actors.It stresses the need for continued vigilance and support against such attacks."
"The PDF describes the activities of a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor group called Dropping Elephant (also known as Chinastrats or Patchwork) that is conducting cyberespionage campaigns against high-profile diplomatic and economic targets in Asia.Dropping Elephants uses spear phishing emails with malicious Office documents or watering hole attacks to infect targets involved in China-related matters.The documents exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, or other documents to drop a large, upX packed AutoIT backdoor.The backdoor downloads additional components from the attackers' servers and can exfiltrate documents, keystrokes, credentials, and other data.The group uses a custom set of custom malware tools, including a file stealer module that gathers system info and iterates through directories to find files with Chinese language extensions like doc, docx, ppt, pgl, ppsx, xlsx, and pdf files.These files are then uploaded to the C2 server and used for command and control.The report provides an in-depth analysis of the group's tactics, tools, infrastructure, and victimology.It highlights the need for advanced threat detection and threat intelligence to identify and block this persistent and sophisticated group's activities.Overall, the report highlights how low-cost, ready-made toolsets can be very effective when combined with high quality social engineering.","The PDF describes research and analysis conducted by Kaspersky Lab on a threat actor group named Dropping Elephant, also known as Chinastrats and Patchwork.The key points are: - Dropping Elephant targets high-profile diplomatic and economic organizations related to China's foreign relations.They use spear phishing and watering hole attacks.- Two main infection vectors are used.One sends a document that phones home when opened, followed by an exploit document to install malware.The other uses a website that requires downloading a document to see full articles, which contains an exploit.- The malware is an AutoIT backdoor that downloads additional components.It steals documents and data like Chrome credentials.- Infrastructure analysis revealed the campaign has been ongoing since at least November 2015.Most victims were in Asia with a focus on Chinese interests.- The group reuses some publicly available tools but combines them effectively with social engineering for successful attacks against high-value targets.- The malware artifacts are not technically advanced, using basic exploits, powershell scripts, and open source tools.Keeping software patched prevents much of the malware.- Attribution analysis tied the group to a threat actor using the alias ""Aleksandr Sirofimov"" which has been linked to previous cybercrime campaigns since 2015.The group may originate from Eastern Europe.In summary, Dropping Elephant is a relatively new but active threat group that has been successfully targeting organizations related to China's foreign relations through simple but cleverly social engineered attacks."
"The PDF describes analysis of malware samples attributed to the Lazarus cybercrime group, which has been active since at least 2016 targeting banks and financial organizations.The malware uses watering hole attacks to infect victims with fake news articles about the financial sector.The initial infection vector is unclear but the malware uses a ""false flag"" technique where it pretends to be a configuration file from a legitimate process and injects into a legitimate DLL to appear as if it were from a malicious process.The configuration file contains encrypted configuration files that are decrypted and loaded by the DLL loader.The encryption uses running XOR followed by RC4 encryption with a 32-byte RC4 key.Once decrypted, the malware establishes communication with command and control servers using transliterated Russian words to indicate the state of its communication or issue backdoor commands.The backdoor commands include: - ""Nachalo"" ""ustanavlivat"" ""vachalo"".The binary protocol is customized for ""hand-on-hand"" communication during the ""hand"" mode, which involves multiple XOR loop operations over 4 bytes, which involve the size of the next data chunk to be received, and decrypted next received data chunk also decrypted.- For example, the ""politpolit"" command instructs the bot to upload the file ""poluch"" to the command server, which may contain a URL marked ""polchuch.polit"".- The same false flag approach was also found in the SWF-based exploit mentioned in a previous 2016-12-07-07 blog post.The analysis shows the malware samples were submitted from Poland in recent weeks.Three samples were found, showing the malware authors used this technique to spoof the origin of the attack.The botnet.exe, fdsvc.dll, and lsass.exe.These samples are encrypted and injected into legitimate process explorer.exe files.The bots communicate with C&C servers specified in the configuration file, which contain Russian words and port numbers.The command servers are delimited with the '|' character.The watering hole exploit kit code itself also contains Russian words, indicating the attack originated from Russia.This technique aims to misattribute the attack to Lazarus.In summary, the analysis provides insight into the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by the Lazarus group to distribute watering hole malware to financial organizations via fake news sites.It aims to help network defenders detect and defend against this technique.","The document analyzes malware used in watering hole attacks on financial institutions attributed to the Lazarus cybercrime group.The malware uses false flags and misleading translations to disguise its origin and evade detection.The attacks start by compromising websites to serve exploits that download malware.The malware stages use encoded shellcode and downloading of components to complicate analysis.Decoding reveals loosely translated Russian words likely meant to mislead investigators into thinking the malware is from Russia.The multi-stage process ultimately leads to execution of unknown final payloads on target systems.The false flags and evolving techniques aim to avoid detection, but in-depth analysis enables attribution and highlights the need for continued monitoring of Lazarus campaigns.Defensive recommendations include implementing provided indicators of compromise."
"The PDF describes a new cyberespionage campaign targeting the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MID) that uses the Konni malware.In October 2021, a presumed phishing campaign targeted the Russian MID with links to spoofed websites impersonating the agency's portals to harvest credentials.In November 2021, the same IP address was used to send emails to the Russian Embassy in Indonesia and deputy minister overseeing non-proliferation and arms control.The emails contained a ""Happy New Year's"" message with a trojanized screensaver attachment.The screensaver downloaded a first-stage Konni agent nearly identical to one previously reported by Malwarebytes.In December 2021, another compromised Russian official was phished and emails sent from the account of another MID official.The initial access was gained by compromising the email account of a staff member of the MID.Once inside the network, the threat actor exploited trusted connections to distribute and load the malware, first by impersonating a government software program coinciding with new Covid mandates, and then through sending trojans from a compromised account.The report assesses with moderate confidence that the campaign was conducted by a threat actor associated with North Korea to establish access to the MID network for espionage purposes.It demonstrates the persistent nature of advanced persistent threat actors waging multi-phased campaigns against perceived high-value networks.Indicators of compromise are provided, including IP addresses, file hashes, malware hashes, and other technical details.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at a new wave of cyber espionage against the Russian government using Konni against the Middle East using phishing and trojanizing tactics.","This PDF documents a cyber espionage campaign targeting the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MID) that uses the Konni malware.Here is a summary: The campaign began in October 2021 with phishing links impersonating MID portals to harvest credentials.In November, the threat actor sent COVID-19 themed lures with files impersonating Russian vaccine registration software that installed malware.In December, the actor compromised an MID email account and sent malicious emails with a trojanized screensaver to MID personnel.Analysis found connections between the phases - same IP, similar TTPs, nearly identical malware.The screensaver downloaded a light-weight loader that retrieved additional payloads from command and control servers.The malware gathered system info and running tasks from infected machines.Based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures, the malware has been attributed to the Konni malware linked to North Korean state-sponsored cyber espionage operations.The campaign demonstrates the persistence of advanced threat actors in targeting high-value organizations through multiple stages to establish network access and enable cyber espionage.Defensive measures like monitoring, multi-factor authentication, and employee education can help protect against such threats."
"The PDF describes an analysis by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 of an IIS backdoor called RGDoor that was used by threat actors targeting organizations in the Middle East.The backdoor is installed as a custom HTTP module on compromised webservers belonging to 8 Middle Eastern government organizations as well as 1 financial and 1 educational institution.It is used as a secondary backdoor to regain access after the initial TwoFace shell is removed.Unlike TwoFace, there is no visual representation of the shell for actors to interact with, so the actors interact with it via the command and control interface.Unit 42 created a client app to test the backdoor's functionality on IIS servers.By checking the HTTP Modules display in IIS Manager, Unit 42 was able to install the module into IIS using the name ""APPCMD.EXE"".This allowed interaction with the backdoor.The module was loaded using the provided by the attacker.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, network IOCs, and YARA rules to detect this backdoor.In summary, the analysis provides an in-depth look at how threat actors deploy and interact with a custom IIS HTTP backdoor used by multiple actors to gain access to Middle Eastern targets.It highlights the importance of threat intelligence to detect and respond to evolving attacks.","The document describes a backdoor named RGDoor used by a threat actor group called OilRig to maintain access to compromised servers, primarily in the Middle East region.OilRig initially infects servers using a web shell called TwoFace.To have a backup method of access if TwoFace is detected and removed, they also install the RGDoor backdoor module into the IIS web server.RGDoor is stealthier as it does not present a visual web interface like TwoFace.It is installed via IIS configuration and checks all HTTP POST requests for commands encrypted in cookie data.Available commands allow uploading/downloading files and running shell commands.RGDoor provides a more discreet and robust backup access mechanism if the TwoFace web shell is remediated on a compromised server.The report found RGDoor installed on web servers belonging to Middle Eastern government, financial, and educational organizations.Specific details are provided on RGDoor's encryption scheme, command structure, and how it interacts with the IIS server.Recommendations are made to monitor IIS logs for telltale RGDoor cookie values.The report concludes that OilRig has contingency plans to regain access, suggesting persistence is a priority for their operations.Defenses against RGDoor are available in various Palo Alto Networks products and services."
"The report describes an investigation by Citizenlab into the apparent use of Sandvine/Procera Networks Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) devices by nation-state actors to deploy spyware in Turkey and Syria and redirect users to affiliate ad revenue-generating content in Egypt.Through internet scanning, Citizenlab found Sandvine middleboxes on Türk Telekom's network being used to redirect hundreds of users to spyware bundled with legitimate Windows software.The spyware was similar to StrongPity APT and FinFisher's ""lawful intercept"" spyware.Targeted users in Turkey downloaded legitimate software from official sites like Avast Antivirus, CCleaner, Opera, and 7-Zip were redirected to malicious versions.This was possible because the sites directed users to non-HTTPS downloads even though they supported HTTPS.Similar middleboxes were found at a Telecom Egypt demarcation point redirecting users to ad-driven content like affiliate ads and cryptocurrency mining scripts.In Syria, targets included users physically located in Syria and those using cross-border Wi-Fi links.In Egypt, the middleboxes redirected users across dozens of ISPs across the country to pay-per-minute affiliate ad and mining sites.The report provides technical analysis of the malware, network injection methods, and associated infrastructure.It concludes that Sandvine's PacketLogic devices were likely used to surreptitiously inject malicious traffic for malicious purposes in Turkey, Syria, Egypt, and Egypt.The use of VPNs and proxy servers for this purpose raises significant human rights concerns.","The report documents an investigation by Citizen Lab into the apparent use of Sandvine/Procera Networks Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) devices to surreptitiously inject malicious content or ads into Internet traffic in Turkey and Egypt.In Turkey, the devices were being used to redirect users attempting to download legitimate Windows programs to versions bundled with spyware associated with the StrongPity APT group.Targets included government critics, Kurdish regions, and Syrian Internet users.In Egypt, a system called AdHose installed on Telecom Egypt's network hijacked users' web connections to redirect them en masse to affiliate ads and browser cryptocurrency mining scripts.AdHose had been operating for years.Extended technical analysis of the injection activities matched them to a fingerprint associated with Sandvine PacketLogic devices.Citizen Lab obtained and tested a PacketLogic device to confirm it could mimic the injections.The report documents how PacketLogic can be configured for regulatory blocking of sites and content.It raises concerns about Sandvine providing such powerful dual-use systems with potential for rights abuses to countries with poor human rights records like Turkey and Egypt.Citizen Lab notified Sandvine and owner Francisco Partners of the issues prior to publication.The companies asserted strong commitment to ethical practices but did not directly address the research findings.Overall, the report illustrates how DPI technology can enable covert attacks and mass surveillance when placed in the wrong hands.It highlights the human rights risks of the unregulated dual-use surveillance industry."
"The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team uncovered a campaign by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group called Mustang Panda that is leveraging the PlugX malware family to target the Southeast Asian state of Myanmar.Mustang Panda (also known as HoneyMyte, Bronze President, and Red Delta) is a prolific APT group that has been active since at least 2012 targeting government and non-government organizations globally.The group typically sends phishing emails with malicious document attachments as an initial infection vector, typically mimicking the targeted country or region.Once inside a target organization, they typically deploy one of a variety of payloads like Cobalt Strike, Poison Ivy, or PlugX, the latter of which is used most extensively.PlugX is a remote access tool (RAT) used by several threat groups.It is the malware of choice for Mustang Panda.This group delivers PlugX implant in the form of an encrypted data blob, which is typically paired with a DLL loader as a benign application.This action then sideloading PlugX into memory.The threat actors had used three legitimate applications within HP Digital Imaging to execute malicious DLLs during execution of the legitimate application, which ultimately replaced a legitimate file on the same folder side by side to replace PlugX with the legitimate DLL.The RAR archives contained a legitimate signed utility from HP, along with a dLL loader and a DAT file that is an encrypted PlugX payload.Each of the RAR files contained embedded configurations that revealed a set of command-and-control domains that masqueraded as Myanmar news outlets.This is not the first time a campaign targeting this state has impersonated Myanmar media outlets or used PlugX.The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of Mustang Panda, as well as previous indication that the group was active in this location, point to reasonable confidence that the China-based threat group known as Mustang Panda is responsible for this campaign Mustang Panda: an Origin StoryMustang Panda.The BlackBerry team analyzed the network infrastructure linked to each of these three RAR file samples, which provided evidence of additional samples that conform to the same or similar TTPs going back as far as late 2020.The report provides indicators of compromise and recommendations for detection and prevention.","The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team uncovered a campaign by the China-based advanced persistent threat (APT) group Mustang Panda targeting Myanmar using the PlugX malware family.Mustang Panda typically sends phishing emails with malicious document attachments as an initial infection vector.Once threat actors gain a foothold within a target organization, they typically deploy payloads such as Cobalt Strike or PlugX.The PlugX malware is used by Mustang Panda to deliver the implant in the form of an encrypted data blob, which is typically paired with a DLL loader and a benign application.In this case, the researchers found PlugX payloads bundled with legitimate signed HP utilities in RAR files communicating with domains masquerading as Myanmar news outlets.The executables side-load malicious DLLs which decrypt and deploy the PlugX payload.This aligns with Mustang Panda's typical tactics of using legitimate apps to stealthily deploy PlugX.The researchers found evidence of related activity back to late 2020.Given the targeting of Myanmar entities, use of PlugX, and impersonation of local news, the campaign fits Mustang Panda's modus operandi.Defenders can use the provided indicators of compromise and mitigation techniques to detect this threat."
"The report describes a series of bank heists originating from post-Soviet states that resulted in large amounts of money being stolen from what initially appeared to be legitimate bank accounts.The heists involved using stolen debit and credit card cards to make cash withdrawals from ATMs located outside the bank's originating country.The stolen cards were distributed to the customers, who were referred to as ""risk levels"" by the attackers.The attackers used ""overdraft"" services to convert the stolen cards into credit cards that could be used to convert cash from the stolen account to a debit card under certain circumstances.The report provides an in-depth analysis of how the stolen debit cards worked, including how the cards were stored, how they were used, and how the card numbers were encrypted and sent to the attacker's server.It also covers the technical details of the malware used in the heists, including the use of various encryption algorithms, encryption keys, and other techniques to evade detection.In summary, the report provides a comprehensive look at how cybercriminals leveraged the post-soviet financial system to steal large sums of money from banks, often using the stolen card numbers to disguise their activities as normal cash withdrawals.It highlights the ongoing threat of advanced persistent threat actors using cybercrime tools like Overdraft to bypass security controls and trick banks into transferring funds.","The report details a series of bank breaches originating from post-Soviet states in 2017.Trustwave investigated these breaches, which involved the theft of millions in cash from bank customer accounts via ATM withdrawals across Europe and Russia.The attacks involved both cyber and physical components.Physically, mules were recruited to open dozens of new bank accounts under fake IDs.They requested debit cards for these accounts, which were then distributed outside the country to be used later.Cybercriminals separately gained access to the bank's network, then the processor's network, and installed monitoring software to capture employee credentials to access the card management system.Using the stolen credentials, they changed account risk ratings from high to low, activated overdraft privileges, removed anti-fraud controls, and raised debit card withdrawal limits.Then the cards were used by mules at specific ATMs chosen for lack of security, ability to dispense high amounts, and distribution across Europe and Russia.Each account was drained of up to $35,000 via coordinated withdrawals over 5 hours.The report discusses the impacts, which included financial losses for the banks, loss of customer trust, and regulatory issues.It provides recommendations on incident response planning, threat hunting, integrated bank systems, and other cybersecurity best practices.Indicators of compromise are listed including malicious files, IP addresses, domains, and tools used by the attackers."
"The document provides an analysis of command and control infrastructure used by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group dubbed ""Advanced Persistent Threat"" in the 2011-2012 cyberattacks dubbed NightDragon.The group targeted the French company SK Communications, which was hacked in July 2011 to steal personal information of up to 35 million users.The attackers infected several SK Communications computers with malware that communicated with callback domains resolving into IP addresses using the Domain Name System (DNS) 3 protocol.The malware communicated with a command server at IP address x.x.x to receive instructions and receive additional C2 instructions.One of the callback domains used in the attack was ""update.alyac.org"", registered in September 2010 but not used by a known company, suggesting it was used for malicious purposes.The DNS server advises that the callback domain is located at IP addresses x.X.x, indicating the malware is communicating with the C2 server located at ixx.z, indicating it may be the fifth domain.While some IPs were compromised by the malware, some computers belong to private individuals and some belong to state-sponsored groups.The report provides technical details on the malware components, C2 communication protocols, and associated infrastructure.It also lists IP addresses, domain names, and IP addresses associated with the malware that may contain malicious content that should not be accessed for safety reasons.Links are drawn between this infrastructure and other APT groups like NightDragon, Sykipot, and others linked to the cyberespionage activities.The attacks demonstrate sophisticated, targeted targeting of high-value targets for espionage and data theft.","The paper presents an analysis of command and control infrastructure used by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group.It examines malicious software and protocols used to communicate with command and control servers.The findings link this activity to major targeted cyberattacks including the 2011 SK Communications hack, the 2011 RSA breach, and the NightDragon attacks on the energy sector.The analysis focuses on activity involving the domain ""alyac.org"" and its subdomains.Communications were observed between compromised computers and these domains using several protocols including LURK, XShell, Update?, Murcy, Oscar, BB, DB, and Qdigit.These protocols reveal information about the victims such as operating system details.The activity enables the attackers to remotely control the compromised systems.The report details how the observed activity is associated with various malware families and attacks.For example, the LURK and Update?/Oscar communications are tied to the Destory remote access trojan used in targeted intrusions.The Murcy malware has links to the 2011 RSA breach.Many of the domains and infrastructure have connections to the NightDragon and Sykipot campaigns.Insight is provided on the attackers' tactics, techniques and procedures.This includes configuring malware to use specified DNS servers, stealing browser cookies for potential session hijacking, using hidden communication channels, and more.Recommendations are made for security teams to monitor DNS traffic, be alert for high-frequency beaconing, and block activity that lacks preceding DNS lookups.Overall, the analysis demonstrates how examining lower-level technical indicators can reveal links between disparate intrusions.The findings illustrate the sophistication of some APT actors by highlighting their infrastructure sharing, malware reuse, and operational security practices.The report provides useful advice to help organizations defend against targeted attacks."
"The PDF discusses how advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are using COVID-19 as a lure in phishing campaigns to infect victims with malware using the coronavirus as an attack vector.The groups use various techniques like embedding malicious macros in Microsoft Office documents, exploiting vulnerabilities in RTF files, and using template injection to drop malware like Kimsuky, Konni, and Ocean Lotus.The macros in the documents drop a remote template that executes a Python script that collects system info and sends it to a command and control (C&C) server.The Python script sends the collected data to the C&C server, which then sends an infinite loop to retrieve additional payloads.The payloads include spyware that gathers system info, keyloggers, screenshots, audio recordings, etc.The report provides an overview of the various attack techniques used by the APT groups, including template injection, macro injection, RTF exploits, and malicious LNK files.It categorizes the groups based on the techniques they use to send spam, spear phishing emails, and use of social engineering lures related to the COVID/19 pandemic as well as their malware delivery methods.The PDF concludes by advising users to be cautious of phishing lures containing keywords related to this pandemic and to monitor for indicators of compromise provided in the PDF.","The white paper provides an overview of how various advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have been using the COVID-19 pandemic as a lure in cyberattacks.It categorizes the techniques used by these groups into four main types: template injection, malicious macros, RTF exploits, and malicious LNK files.Template injection refers to embedding a script in a document that fetches a remote malicious template.Groups like Kimsuky and Gamaredon have used COVID-19 themed documents with template injection to target victims.The malicious templates typically contain macros that collect system information and exfiltrate it.Embedding malicious macros directly in documents has been the most common technique.Groups like Kimsuky, Konni, APT36, Patchwork, Hades, TA505, TA542, Bitter, and Ocean Lotus have used macro-enabled COVID-19 themed documents that drop malware like remote access Trojans after being opened.The macros are usually obfuscated and decrypt malicious payloads.Some Chinese groups have used COVID-19 themed RTF files exploiting the equation editor vulnerability to drop backdoors.Calypso group and Winnti are examples of actors using this technique recently.Malicious LNK files have also been observed in campaigns by groups like Mustang Panda and Higaisia.Opening the LNK file leads to execution of the command embedded in the property section, which decodes an embedded base64 payload and drops it into the victim's machine.The dropped payload is a cabinet file that contains multiple files, and content is extracted using the legitimate Windows executable ""extract.exe"".The LNK files link to scripts that eventually drop remote access Trojans.In summary, the white paper provides an overview of how various sophisticated threat actors have quickly adopted COVID-19 themes and current events in their social engineering tactics and cyberattacks.Their techniques involve using the pandemic crisis as a lure in phishing emails and weaponized documents that infect systems with malware like remote access Trojans upon opening."
"The document analyzes the activities of a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group called APT41, which the U.S. Justice Department indicted on September 16, 2020 for hacking attacks against over 100 institutions globally.The group targeted companies in sectors like video game companies, telecoms, universities, and non-profit organizations.The intrusions allowed the hackers to steal source code, customer account data, and personally identifiable information.They also conducted ransomware attacks, including the ColdLock campaign targeting Taiwan's energy sector in May 2019.Analysis of the attack chain shows the attackers use scheduled tasks to spread ransomware to infect as many machines as possible, including SMB and IIS Web Service to copy ""lc.tmp"" (the main ransomware loader in this incident) to other victims' host machines.The next-stage payloads were Cobalt Strike payloads that decrypted the main ransomware payloads and payloads, which were either stored inside itself or embedded in separate files.After the loader and payload pairs were successfully installed, the attacker started poking around the environment with tools like password stealers, password dumpers, and HTTP tunneling tools.The ransomware attacks were launched one month later, possibly for espionage purposes based on infrastructure overlaps.The report provides technical details on how the attackers used SMB, IIS, scheduled tasks, and other techniques to spread the ransomware across the network.It outlines how the group used supply chain attacks to compromise software providers and modify their code to compromise customers and spread influence further.The threat actors used exploits, common vulnerabilities, and custom loaders to gain initial access, move laterally, and maintain long-term access.The attacks targeted a range of industries in Asia, including gaming, telecom, retail, energy, and retail.While attribution is unclear, the report speculates the group may have Chinese origins based on language artifacts in their malware.Overall, the indictment provides insight into the group's tactics, tools, infrastructure, and motivations.","In September 2020, the U.S. Justice Department charged 5 Chinese citizens associated with the APT41 hacking group for cyberattacks on over 100 organizations globally.The hackers engaged in cryptojacking, ransomware attacks, theft of source code and PII, video game fraud, and more.They used public exploits and supply chain attacks to compromise targets.Trend Micro had connected APT41 to ransomware attacks on Taiwan organizations earlier in 2020.The ransomware, called ColdLock, spread via Active Directory and scheduled tasks.Further analysis found the group was lurking in target networks for months beforehand, using custom loaders and Cobalt Strike.They targeted energy, retail, telecom, and more in Southeast Asia.Infrastructure links suggest ties to Chinese espionage.APT41 has sophisticated tools and is a persistent threat, requiring robust defenses like AI-powered detection, sandboxing, and threat intelligence.In summary, the PDF covers the U.S. charges against APT41 hackers as well as previous research connecting them to wide-ranging cyberattacks and espionage, emphasizing the need for strong security measures."
"The document analyzes a Mac malware campaign dubbed Operation In(ter)ception by the Lazarus cybercrime group targeting the cryptocurrency industry.- A signed Mac executable disguised as a job description for Coinbase was uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil.- The malware is compiled for Intel and Apple Silicon and drops three files: a decoy PDF, a bundle app FinderFontsUpdater.app, and a downloader called safarifontagent.It uses a certificate issued in February 2022 to a developer named Shankey Nohria and team identifier 264HFWQH63.The app is not notarized and Apple has revoked the certificate.The Windows counterpart drops the exact same decoy (2B4E8F1927927BDC2F71914BA1F12511D9B6BDBDBDB2DF390E267F54DC 4F8919DD).- The downloader connects to a different C&C server (url OSX/NukeSped.N) as the Windows version did not respond at the time of analysis.- Similar to a similar Windows malware discovery in May 2022, the Mac malware uses the same signed Mach-O executable and drops the same PDF decoy.However, this time the bundle is signed on July 21, 2022 using a new certificate issued to Shankey.This suggests the malware is part of a Lazarus Mac campaign.- ESET researchers uncovered the malware in Brazil using VirusTotal and analyzed it.They believe it was likely created by Lazarus based on code similarities to previous Mac malware used by the group.- including the use of a signed with the same certificate.- but with a different Apple developer.- and that this campaign aligns with previous Mac-focused attacks attributed to Lazarus.In summary, this represents an example of an ongoing, targeted campaign against the cryptocurrency sector by Lazarus for Mac.","ESET researchers discovered a new malware campaign targeting Mac users that is attributed to the Lazarus threat group.On August 16, 2022, ESET announced on Twitter that a signed Mac executable disguised as a Coinbase job description was uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil.This is similar to a campaign ESET uncovered in May 2022 originating from Singapore.The malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures.It drops three files: a PDF job description decoy, a bundle called FinderFontsUpdater.app, and a downloader called safarifontagent.The bundle is signed with a certificate issued in February 2022 that Apple revoked on August 12, 2022.Unlike the May campaign, this version connects to a different command and control server at concrecapital[.]com.The server did not respond when analyzed.On August 4, 2022, another security researcher found a Windows version dropping the same PDF and connecting to a different C2.ESET believes this new activity is part of Lazarus' Operation In(ter)ception campaign targeting Mac users.The malware bypasses security products by disguising itself as a legitimate job application.The use of code signing and targeting of cryptocurrency companies indicates the likely purpose is cyberespionage and financial theft.ESET provided hashes for the dropped files and C2 domain to help identify infections.They assess this demonstrates Lazarus' continued efforts to breach MacOS devices through social engineering and Trojanized applications."
"The document describes a new wave of cyberespionage campaigns using a malware family called Bandook, which was previously reported on in 2015-2017.Bandook is a 13-year-old backdoor trojan that was previously believed to be developed and sold by a third party to governments and threat actors worldwide.The attacks start with a malicious Microsoft Word document delivered in a ZIP file containing macros that download additional scripts.The scripts drop and execute a PowerShell script encrypted in the original Word document, which then downloads and executes the final Bandook backdoor.The malware uses various techniques to evade detection, including: Encrypting encrypted data embedded in the document, accessing the external template code hidden by a small font size and white foreground object, and decrypting the embedded data from the original document.Lure documents that appear benign but contain macros.Changing the malicious external template template after a certain period of time further obfuscates analysis.Targeting an unusually large variety of sectors and locations, suggesting the malware is not developed by a single entity but is part of an offensive infrastructure sold to multiple threat actors.The infection chain is constantly evolving, with each new campaign evolving its tactics and techniques.The report provides an overview of the infection process, analysis of the malware variants, and recommendations for detection and prevention.In summary, the document provides an in-depth look at the evolution of the Bandook malware attack chain and techniques used by an unknown third party selling the malware to various threat actors globally, shedding light on the evolving tactics, techniques, and procedures used in each campaign.It highlights the ongoing evolution of this once-malware.","The document is about a malware named Bandook that is used in a targeted attack.Bandook has a modular architecture and rich feature set including keylogging, screen captures, credential theft etc.It uses a loader written in Delphi and payload injected into Internet Explorer.It consists of three stages: Lure Documents, PowerShell Loader, and the Bandook Loader.The first stage starts with a Microsoft Word document containing malicious script data and an external template.The second stage decodes and executes a base64 encoded PowerShell stored in the second dropped file.The third stage is the final payload, which is a variant of an old full-featured RAT named Bandook.The malware uses the Process Hollowing technique to create a new instance of an Internet Explorer process and inject a malicious payload into it.The payload contacts the C&C server, sends basic information about the infected machine, and waits for additional commands from the server.The variants of the Bandook malware share similar methods of communication and incorporate commands that are not available in any other public leak or report.The authors believe that the same attacker who operated during the Dark Caracal operation is behind this malware infrastructure and is still active and willing to assist in cyber operations."
"The document describes a new threat actor called Blue Mockingbird that is deploying Monero cryptocurrency-mining payloads on Windows systems to mine Monero.The payloads are dynamic-link library (DLL) files that exploit vulnerabilities in Telerik UI for ASP.NET to gain initial access and persist on systems.The initial DLL payload is XMRIG packaged as a DLL.The DLLs are uploaded to a web application running on IIS servers that are vulnerable to the CVE-2019-18935 deserialization vulnerability.This allows the threat actor to gain persistence on the system and execute code.The malware uses various techniques to evade detection, including proxying and reverse shells.The earliest tools were created in December 2019.In some cases, the payloads communicate with command and control servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data.Red Canary Intel is monitoring the activity for indicators of compromise like file hashes, network IOCs, and IIS access logs.They recommend using process injection detection and threat intelligence to detect the threat.In summary, the document provides an in-depth analysis of Blue Mockedbird's tactics, techniques, and procedures to detect and respond to this new wave of Monero-mining malware.The threat actors behind it are using dynamic DLL exploitation to compromise Windows systems for cryptocurrency mining.The use of public-facing web applications and vulnerabilities like CVE-1918935 for persistence is a common entry point.","The document describes a threat actor called Blue Mockingbird that has been deploying Monero cryptocurrency mining malware on Windows machines across multiple organizations.Blue Mockingbird gains initial access by exploiting the CVE-2019-18935 vulnerability in Telerik UI web applications.The attacker leverages the privileges of a DCOM class and IIS Application Pool Identity's SeImpersonate privilege to perform the escalation.Once in, they use various techniques like process injection, DLL sideloading, and privilege escalation to deploy and persist a malicious Monero miner built on XMRig.The miner payload communicates with external mining pools to mine Monero.Blue Mockingbird uses lateral movement techniques like RDP and Windows admin shares to distribute the payload across the network.Blue Mockingbird appears to experiment with different tools, such as Fast Reverse Proxy (frp), Secure Socket Funneling (SSF), and Venom, to pivot between systems.They have also experimented with different reverse shell and proxy tools for command and control.Persistence mechanisms involve hijacking services like wercplsupport using COR_PROFILER COM hijacking.The malware compiles each payload with a list of commonly used Monero-mining domains and a wallet address, which can be extracted from the binary or observed in network traffic.Red Canary provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, Monero wallet addresses, and analytics to detect the miner payloads, privilege escalation, and lateral movement.They also advise patching public-facing apps and establishing a baseline of normal scheduled tasks.In summary, the document analyzes a sophisticated, evolving threat actor distributing stealthy cryptocurrency miners using multiple intrusion techniques across victim networks."
"The PDF describes a cyberespionage campaign called Operation Spalax that has been targeting entities in Colombia since at least 2018.The attackers send phishing emails with malicious PDF attachments that download remote access trojans (RATs) from legitimate file hosting services.The RATs use dynamic DNS and IP addresses for command and control.The attacks target government institutions and private companies in sectors like energy and metallurgical, with the most targeted being energy and mining.The emails pretend to be from government entities like the Attorney General's Office or the National Directorate of Taxes and Customs.The attachments contain generic topics like COVID-19 notices and financial fraud alerts.When opened, the PDFs drop a downloader that decrypts and executes the RAT payload, which is typically Remcos, njRAT, or AsyncRAT.The C&C servers use linkpc.net and publicvm.com subdomains, as well as IP addresses associated with VPN provider Powerhouse Management.Over 70 domains registered in 2020/2021 have been identified, indicating an active threat actor.The infrastructure uses compromised devices as proxies and dynamic DNS for persistence.Attribution is difficult as the attacks share some TTPs with previous activity but also differ in many ways, making attribution difficult.The threat actors show perfect Spanish language usage in the emails they send, they only target Colombian entities, and they use premade malware and don't develop any themselves.Some of the targets in the current campaign (such as a lottery agency) don't make much sense for spying activities.While we have not seen any payloads delivered by the attackers other than RATSs, some of the emails suggest the sender has been involved in cybercrime, not espionage.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at the tactics, techniques, infrastructure, and attribution of a sophisticated, ongoing threat actor active in Colombia for nearly a year using phishing and RAT malware.","The PDF describes a series of ongoing malware attacks targeting Colombian government institutions and private companies, called Operation Spalax.The attackers use phishing emails containing malicious links or attachments to distribute remote access trojans (RATs) to victims.The RATs allow them to spy on targets by logging keystrokes, taking screenshots, accessing webcams/microphones, and exfiltrating documents.Three different RATs have been observed: Remcos, njRAT, and AsyncRAT.They are distributed via droppers packed with various obfuscation techniques to avoid detection.The droppers decrypt and execute the RAT payloads.The attackers have a large, dynamic infrastructure to hide their activities, including 24+ IP addresses and 70+ domain names registered with free dynamic DNS services since mid-2020.Most IPs are residential addresses in Colombia, likely compromised machines proxying traffic.The attacks are still active and expected to continue targeting Colombian entities.The attackers tailor phishing emails to targets using native Spanish and Colombian themes.While their motives appear to be cyber espionage, some targets like lotteries suggest possible cybercrime links too.In summary, the PDF provides an overview of the ongoing, targeted RAT attacks against Colombian entities using phishing and obfuscated droppers to distribute spyware, supported by a large, hidden network infrastructure.The threat actors are persistent and expected to continue intrusion attempts in the region."
"The PDF describes research by Check Point on a long-running mobile surveillance campaign targeting the Uyghur ethnic group in China.The campaign has been attributed to a threat actor group called Scarlet Mimic, which has been active since at least 2016.The group uses Android spyware called MobileOrder to target victims with social engineering lures disguised as PDFs, photos, or audio files.When opened, the malware performs extensive surveillance actions in the background, including stealing sensitive data like device info, SMS, calls, location, and files stored on the device.It can also execute commands to run a remote shell, take photos, run calls, manipulate SMS, call logs, local files, and record surround sound.The malware has evolved over time to add new features like location tracking using the standard Android LocationListener implementation.It still does not support modern Android features like runtime permissions or battery optimization.The report provides technical analysis of the malware's evolution over 7 years, showing it was likely developed by the same group over multiple iterations.Some changes include moving malicious strings to the resources section of the app, encoding strings in base64, and adding new geolocation features.While the malware is unsophisticated, its capabilities allow the attackers to easily steal sensitive data from the infected device, as well as perform calls or send an SMS on the victim's behalf and track their location in real-time.This makes it a powerful and dangerous surveillance tool.The threat actors continue to develop and deploy the malware for so many years, indicating they have been successful in at least some of their operations.While not definitively proven, the fact that the threat actors have successfully conducted surveillance campaigns against this ethnic group over 7+ years suggests they have succeeded in some form or another.","The PDF describes a 7-year long mobile surveillance campaign called Scarlet Mimic that has targeted the Uyghur minority community.The threat actor has used over 20 variations of Android spyware called MobileOrder disguised as Uyghur-related content like books, pictures, and audio files.The malware can steal sensitive data from infected devices like location, SMS, calls, files, and can also perform active commands like taking photos, recording audio, manipulating SMS/calls, and installing additional malware.The malware has evolved over time to evade detection, with the actors experimenting with hiding malicious strings in resources and encoding them.New features have also been added like real-time location tracking.The malware uses AES encryption to communicate with command and control servers, which can be hardcoded in the malware or retrieved from ""dead drop"" resolvers on blog sites.The actors have continuously updated the malware and used social engineering to distribute it through lures like Uyghur-related photos and documents, indicating an ongoing successful campaign.Based on code overlaps, infrastructure, and targeting, the campaign has been attributed to the Scarlet Mimic group which has previously targeted this community on Windows and MacOS.The shift to mobile malware aligns with a growing trend of mobile surveillance.The technical analysis provides an in-depth look at how the malware functions for exfiltrating data and manipulating the compromised device."
"The PDF analyzes a malware analysis report titled ""W32/Regin, Stage #1tlp: wHite1.pdf"" that provides an in-depth look at the inner workings of a sophisticated Windows malware family called Regin.Regin is a sophisticated cyberespionage threat that targets the Windows platform and has been active since at least 2004.The report analyzes 27 samples of Regin's stage #1 malware, which is a support module that acts as a backdoor to enable and facilitate the operations of stage #2.The samples are compiled and run as Portable Executable (PE) files for Windows NT, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2004.They contain embedded code templates that can be customized to add or remove malicious code.The malware retrieves encrypted content from specific locations on compromised systems, maps it to kernel memory, and transfers control to the next stage module.The module uses a complex ""trampoline"" technique to mask the payload's access to API functions.Analysis of the sample header and sections reveals the QuickPeParse function, header, sections, and code.Trampolines are of particular interest, as the malware uses the unusual ""trampsolines"" technique of masking the payload’s access to the API functions in order to evade detection.The sample statistics show that 20% of the samples are ""pure"" samples, 20% are ""augmented"" samples with malicious code, and 7% have ""Augmented"" malware.This indicates the malware authors' intention to remain undetected for as long as possible.The analysis provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, registry keys, and OS versions, C2 IP addresses, and other technical details on the malware's inner workings.to aid detection and prevention of this threat.","The document analyzes the first stage malware component of Regin, a complex cyberespionage threat.Stage 1 is designed to retrieve and load an encrypted payload (stage 2) from an already compromised system and make it harder to detect.Analysis of 27 samples shows stage 1 targets Windows, supports NT 4.0 and up, and samples fall into ""pure"" or ""augmented"" categories.The malware retrieves the payload from extended file attributes or the registry if that fails.It decrypts the payload using an XOR algorithm.Stage 1 uses an unusual ""trampoline"" technique to hide the payload's calls to external functions.It resolves imports but redirects calls through chunks of code that mask the origin of API calls.This fools monitoring tools into thinking calls come from trusted modules.The malware maps the payload into memory like a PE loader, processes relocations, and masks certain data directories.It then transfers control to stage 2.The report concludes stage 1 is purely support code to hide additional components, but shows the developers are skilled coders with significant resources.Indicators of compromise, code examples demonstrating the trampoline technique, and other technical details are provided.The author speculates there may be a 64-bit version based on supported relocation types."
"Talos has identified a targeted cyberattack campaign affecting the Middle East that uses documents purported to be from a Jordanian research institute Dar El-Jaleel.The attacks involve using VBScript, PowerShell, and VBA scripts to dynamically load and execute functions retrieved from a command and control server.The scripts use macros and obfuscation techniques to evade detection.The attackers demonstrate excellent operational security, using CloudFlare to hide their infrastructure and blocking systems that don't meet their criteria.They also deploy reconnaissance scripts to check the validity of victim machines before activating their infrastructure.The campaign starts with a VBS script that creates a PowerShell script to create a Microsoft Office document titled ""Report.doc"" and to open it.This script contains a Macro that triggers a second stage PowerShell script described in the next Email & Web Tra c Reputation Community.The second stage script creates a WSF script that downloads and executes a third stage Scanner tool.The Scanner collects system info and sends it to the C2 server.It can capture screenshots, keystrokes, keylogs, and other data.The C2 can then send the stolen data to the attacker's server.While this is not the first time this has happened, it does appear to be the first targeted campaign using documents purportedly from the Dar El Jaleel research institute.However, there is no indication the two campaigns are related.Talos provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, domains, IP addresses, and YARA rules to detect this campaign.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at a sophisticated, targeted attack campaign targeting Middle Eastern targets likely by an Iranian threat actor.","The document describes a targeted attack campaign affecting the Middle East that uses VBScript, PowerShell, and VBA macros to deploy malware.The campaign starts with a VBScript that generates a PowerShell script.The PowerShell script creates a weaponized Office document containing macros.When opened, the macro creates and executes a Windows Script File (WSF).The WSF file contains the main malware functionality, configured to contact a command and control server, oce-update[.]services.It registers the infected system and retrieves additional payloads, which are obfuscated VBScript functions.The payloads include reconnaissance functions to fingerprint the infected system, persistence functions, and a pivot function to download and execute shellcode from another IP address.The attacker exhibits strong operational security, using CloudFlare to hide infrastructure, filtering on user agents, and only enabling C2 servers briefly.Code analysis shows similarities to the Jenxcus/Houdini malware.Decoy documents pretend to be confidential reports from a Jordanian research institute on regional conflicts.This and other clues suggest the campaign targets individuals with interest in Middle East politics and military affairs.Talos provides IOCs, detection coverage, and recommendations like updating software, blocking scripts, using email security, and building threat intelligence.In summary, the report analyzes an advanced, targeted VBScript malware campaign affecting the Middle East region."
"The PDF discusses a recent strategic web compromise (SWC) attack targeting the website of the U.S. organization Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) that leveraged a zero-day vulnerability CVE-2014-0322 to infect victims with ZxShell malware.CrowdStrike attributed the attack to the AURORA PANDA APT group, but further analysis revealed that another threat actor was using the same vulnerability nearly a month earlier, on January 17, 2014, to target French aerospace companies including Safran, Groupement des industries françaises aéronautiques et spatiales (GIFAS).The iframe on the GIFAS website redirected visitors to a domain called gifas[.]assso[.]net that hosted exploit code and a malicious payload (Erido.jpg).This malware variant connected to command and control infrastructure at oa[.]ameteksen[.]com, which was likely used to host the Sakula malware.Sakula had an interesting component that added a number of domains to the ""host's"" list of victim machines, likely to ensure DNS connectivity to these particular domains.The purpose of this component is unclear, but it does not map these domains to malicious IPs meant to send victims directly to adversary infrastructure for credential collection.There are three primary similarities between this attack on Capstone Turbine in 2012 and this recent SWC campaign against VFW: - The content taken from the French aerospace company Safran's website and GIFAS-based domain hosting the exploit code, indicating a focus on French aerospace.- The targeting of Safran is consistent with their engine design and engine engine operations.- Similarities in tactics, techniques, infrastructure, and targeting of French aerospace indicate the threat actor is likely targeting this sector as well beyond VFW.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at a new wave of SWC activity originating from France that shares many of the hallmarks with previous activity attributed to a known threat actor targeting the aerospace industry in 2012-2013.","The document analyzes a cyberespionage campaign targeting the French aerospace industry in early 2014.The attackers exploited the CVE-2014-0322 vulnerability using a strategic web compromise to infect victims with Sakula malware.The malware and infrastructure showed connections to French aerospace companies like Safran.The attackers compromised a Safran subdomain and DNS records.The Sakula malware also modified hosts files to include internal Snecma domains.This attack shares tactics, techniques, and procedures with a 2012 campaign that compromised the website of US turbine manufacturer Capstone Turbine.Both used the Sakula malware, exploited zero-days, and involved domains referencing the French aerospace association GIFAS.While the victims are unknown, the indicators point to a focused campaign against French aerospace entities potentially for cyberespionage.The report highlights the importance of securing public-facing websites and DNS infrastructure against state-sponsored threats.Proactive monitoring for strategic web compromises and malware is recommended."
"The PDF describes a destructive malware campaign called Operation Bleeding Bear that targeted organizations in Ukraine over the weekend of January 15-16, 2022.The attackers used a multi-stage malware campaign starting with the WhisperGate malware component that utilizes a wiper component to wipe the Master Boot Record (MBR) on boot drives, rendering systems inoperable after boot-up.A second stage file infector component was also used to corrupt files in specific directories with specific file extensions.Techniques observed include process hollowing, tampering with Windows Defender, using a Master Boot record wiper, and file corruptor component.The elements used in this campaign lack the common characteristics of a ransomware compromise - in this case the adversary uses the same Bitcoin address for each victim and offers no sign of intent to help decrypt the victim’s machine.This case highlights the importance of prevention when it's up against ransomware and malware with destructive capabilities.Elastic Security prevents each stage of the described campaign using their endpoint protection features.The PDF provides an in-depth analysis of the malware stages, capabilities, and infrastructure used in the campaign.It demonstrates the need for advanced threat detection and protection against targeted attacks like this.","Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF document: The document analyzes a new destructive malware campaign called Operation Bleeding Bear targeting organizations in Ukraine.The multi-stage attack involves an initial MBR wiper payload to make systems inoperable, followed by a file infector to corrupt specific file types.The first stage MBR wiper overwrites the master boot record, displaying a ransom note on reboot though no decryption is offered.The second stage uses a Discord downloader to retrieve the main payload which tampers with Windows Defender through scripts and process hollowing.The final payload leverages process hollowing to load a file corrupter that overwrites, renames, and deletes targeted file types on local and networked drives.The goal appears to be destroying data rather than obtaining ransom.Elastic Security is able to prevent each stage of the attack using memory threat prevention, malware prevention, and ransomware prevention capabilities.Queries and detection rules are provided to identify the malicious behaviors.The campaign matches past destructive attacks like NotPetya that aim to destabilize and sow chaos rather than financial gain.The analysis provides insight into the adversary's techniques and how Elastic Security can mitigate similar threats."
"The PDF describes an overview of major cyberthreats and recommendations for defending against them, including: - Defending networks from advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like Deep Panda (also known as Panda/Beetle Tiger).- Identifying and responding to threats by understanding your adversaries through threat intelligence and pattern analysis.This includes understanding the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by each APT group.For example, Deep Panda targets financial, technology, and defense sectors.- Anchor Panda goes after government, military, aerospace, and critical infrastructure.- Financially-motivated groups like Evil Panda target NGOs and dissident groups.- Evil Panda uses spear-phishing to gain initial access, then leverages legitimate digital signatures to evade detection.- Viceroy Tiger targets government, law firms, media, telecoms, and media entities.- Venomous Panda targets dissidents, journalists, activists, and others in the energy, telecom, manufacturing, law, and telecom sectors.The report outlines mitigation strategies like monitoring for indicators of compromise, cleaning networks before remediation, conducting forensics for months before containment, and actively hunting for anomalies.- Protecting networks requires a mix of human and machine learning capabilities to identify threats early and respond effectively.In summary, the report outlines the key points: Defending against advanced persistent threats requires a combination of threat intelligence, threat hunting, and human-centric security strategies to detect and respond to sophisticated adversaries.It emphasizes the importance of incident response planning and threat intelligence to understand your adversaries.","The PDF discusses tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by various Chinese and Russian cyber threat actors to compromise networks, as well as recommendations for defending against and responding to such intrusions.It provides an overview of different Chinese threat actor groups, their targeting sectors, and group names - for example, Deep Panda targets financial, technology, and non-profit organizations.It also covers Russian groups like Energetic Bear which targets oil/gas companies.The document emphasizes the importance of shifting detection from indicators of compromise (IOCs) like IP addresses to indicators of attack (IOAs) like malicious behaviors and process flows.IOAs are more effective since attacker TTPs are rapidly changing while some core behaviors remain constant.Understanding your adversaries helps focus intelligence gathering and analysis.A case study highlights how multiple adversary groups can concurrently compromise a network.Forensic analysis revealed two separate toolsets, attributed to Elegant Panda and Cozy Bear.The need for visibility, rapid containment, and assuming multiple adversaries are present is emphasized.Key mitigation takeaways include controlling privileged accounts, resetting service accounts, blacklisting IOCs selectively, and striving to detect intruders early in the attack chain via visibility and behavioral analytics.The earlier an intruder is detected, the more options a defender has to respond and contain the threat."
"The document analyzes a cyberespionage group called Calypso RAT that has been active since at least September 2016 targeting government organizations in countries like Brazil, India, Kazakhstan, Russia, Thailand, and Turkey.The group uses an ASPX web shell to gain initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities or by guessing default credentials.Once inside the network, they upload utilities and malware like PlugX, Byeby, and CalypssoRAT.They use proxy servers and public utilities like DCSync and Mimikatz to move laterally and remain undetected.The malware installation process follows the typical installation structure of a malware family, with the main payload being a BAT dropper that extracts payloads from the network and installs a backdoor called BATDropper.The backdoor communicates with command and control servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data.It can execute commands, upload/download files, execute shellcode, and more.The report provides technical details on the malware components, installation process, command handling, and other artifacts left behind by the group.It also profiles the attackers' infrastructure, including IP addresses, domain names, and C2 servers.The attackers appear to be of Asian origin based on language artifacts, use of PlugX and Byeby malware, and use of a proxy server.The primary goal of the group is theft of confidential data from government organizations, with a focus on espionage and data exfiltration.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at the tactics, techniques, and procedures of an Asian-linked threat actor active since 2016, providing evidence to attribute Calyposer to this group.for cyber espionage operations.","The document describes an advanced persistent threat (APT) group named Calypso that has been active since at least September 2016.Calypso targets government institutions in several countries, including Brazil, India, Kazakhstan, Russia, Thailand, and Turkey, with the goal of stealing confidential data.The report provides an analysis of the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by Calypso.The group typically gains initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities or guessing default credentials to upload a web shell.They then use publicly available tools like Mimikatz for lateral movement and credential access.Custom malware like Calypso RAT, PlugX, and a modified Byeby trojan are deployed on compromised hosts for command and control.Detailed analysis is provided on the Calypso RAT malware, including its dropper, installation script, shellcode, commands, modules, and network communication.Variants using different payloads like Hussar and FlyingDutchman are also examined.Evidence suggests the Calypso group originates from Asia, based on IP addresses traced back to China Telecom, artifacts in scripts and configuration files, and the use of PlugX malware associated with Asian APTs.Links to the SongXY group are noted but inconclusive.The report concludes with indicators of compromise and maps Calypso's tactics to the MITRE ATT&CK framework technique IDs.In summary, Calypso is an active, stealthy threat group that continues to target government institutions to steal confidential data using custom malware and tactics."
"The document describes a novel malware ecosystem impacting VMware ESXi, Linux vCenter servers, and Windows virtual machines that enables persistent admin access to ESXi hypervisors.Mandiant discovered two new malware families named VIRTUALPITA and VIRTUCIALPIE installed through malicious vSphere Installation Bundles (VIBs) on ESXi servers.VIBs are files designed to facilitate software distribution and virtual system management.They contain XML descriptors, signature files, and VIB payloads that execute on boot to install the malware payloads.The payloads allow the attacker to maintain admin access, send commands to the hypervisor, transfer files between ESXi and guest VM systems, tamper with logging services, and execute arbitrary commands from one guest VM to another guest VM running on the same hypervisor.The malware ecosystem was initially detected during an intrusion investigation when Mandiant identified attacker commands from the legitimate VMware Tools process vmtoolsd.exe on a Windows virtual machine hosted on an ESXi server.The VIB package can be used to create startup tasks, custom firewall rules, deploy custom binaries upon the restart of ESXi machines.Since ESXi utilizes an in-memory filesystem, file edits are not saved across reboots.The signature file is used to verify the host acceptance level of a VIB.The default acceptance level is published by VMware but can be changed manually.The malicious files were created by modifying the XML descriptor field to change the acceptance level from Partner Supported to Community Supported, indicating the VIB was created by a third party rather than a partner vendor.This is not a remote code execution vulnerability.The attackers need admin-level ESXi admin privileges to gain initial access before deploying malware.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, IP addresses, and hashes to detect the malware.In summary, the document analyzes a novel technique of persistent malware persistence within ESXi environments by leveraging malicious VIB packages to install multiple backdoors on VMware hypervisors for persistence and data exfiltration.It demonstrates the shift to EDR-based threat detection and response to evade traditional endpoint security solutions.","The PDF document from Mandiant details the investigation of novel malware being deployed on VMware ESXi hypervisors by a threat actor tracked as UNC3886.The malware ecosystem enables persistent administrative access to the hypervisor, command execution on guest VMs, file transfers between the hypervisor and VMs, tampering with logs, and executing commands between VMs on the same hypervisor.The malware was initially detected when commands were seen coming from the vmtoolsd process on a Windows VM hosted on an ESXi hypervisor.Analysis of the ESXi boot profiles revealed malicious VIBs (vSphere Installation Bundles) being used to deploy backdoors called VIRTUALPITA and VIRTUALPIE on the hypervisors after reboot.The VIBs were signed as PartnerSupported though they were actually CommunitySupported, allowing installation with the --force flag.VIRTUALPITA creates a listener on the hypervisor for arbitrary command execution, file transfers, and starting/stopping logging.VIRTUALPIE is a Python backdoor with similar capabilities.Commands executed on the hypervisor are sent to guest VMs via vmtoolsd.exe for execution.This was used for file enumeration, compression, and credential dumping.VARIUALPITA samples were also found on Linux vCenter systems masquerading as a legitimate process.Windows VMs hosted on the compromised hypervisors contained VIRTUALGATE, a utility that uses VMCI sockets to run commands on guest VMs from the hypervisor.Based on the nature of the intrusions, Mandiant assesses UNC3886 has a likely China nexus and espionage motivations.Indicators of compromise, Yara rules, and recommendations for hardening ESXi/vSphere environments are provided."

"The document describes a cyber espionage campaign targeting the users of Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL), a government-owned company that makes warships and submarines for the Indian Navy.In January 2017, attackers sent spear-phishing emails impersonating the email id of Hidrofersa, a Spain-based company that designs naval, industrial, and mining equipment, to users associated with MDL.The emails contained malicious Excel docs that when opened dropped malware capable of spying on the infected system.The malware used a technique called UAC hijacking to bypass security monitoring and bypass UAC account control.The macros in the Excel docs were reverse engineered to understand its capabilities.The macro code contained junk code, comments, variable assignments, and obfuscated code names to evade detection.It downloaded and executed a PowerShell script that dropped a registry entry to execute a malicious executable.The executable connected to a command and control server and could exfiltrate data.The goal appears to be to infect, take control, and steal sensitive information from MDL systems to enable further cyberespionage.MDL is a trusted source for naval and submarine supply chain information and has worked with the Indian government on projects like INS Chennai and Kalvari subs.The targeting of MDL aligns with previous cyber espionage campaigns targeting Indian government entities.The report provides indicators of compromise and MITRE ATT&CK techniques to detect the attack.","The PDF describes a cyberattack campaign targeting Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL), an Indian company that manufactures submarines and warships for the Indian Navy.- On January 25, 2017, the day before India's Republic Day celebrations, attackers sent spear-phishing emails pretending to be from a Spanish naval equipment company called Hidrofersa.The emails contained malicious Excel files that installed a malware called KeyBase if macros were enabled.The attackers researched the trust relationship between MDL and Hidrofersa, a equipment manufacturer, to increase the chances of recipients opening the attachment.- KeyBase is a spyware that can steal sensitive information like keystrokes, screenshots, browser history etc and send it back to the attackers.The timing of the attack suggests the attackers wanted to steal sensitive design information about MDL's submarines and warships.- The malware communicated with a command and control server at the domain tripleshop[.]id hosted on a server in Indonesia.The attackers used obfuscated macro code and downloaded malware from a compromised university site in Indonesia to carry out the attack.- Analysis of the email headers suggests the attack may have originated from a Pakistan-based freight company called Combined Freight.Previous campaigns have also targeted Indian government organizations and embassies.- The attack shows hallmarks of a state-sponsored campaign to steal intellectual property and gain military advantages.The malware was designed to be stealthy and evade detection.Cyber espionage groups continue to target defense industries and manufacturers to steal proprietary information."
"The document discusses recent activity by APT29, a Russian state-sponsored threat actor likely linked to the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), targeting Microsoft 365 and other organizations.In 2022, the group has focused on organizations involved in influencing NATO foreign policy, including revisiting victims they had compromised years ago.This persistence and aggressiveness is indicative of sustained interest in sensitive information and tasking by the Russian government.The group continues to demonstrate exceptional operational security and advanced tactics against Microsoft 365, including disabling Microsoft 365's Purview Audit logging features and abusing the self-enrollment process for MFA in Azure AD to gain access to dormant accounts.They have also targeted the inbox for email collection.The document provides technical analysis of how the group abuses Microsoft 365 features like MFA enrollment prompts and MFA takeovers to gain unauthorized access to accounts.Recommendations include implementing multi-factor authentication with bi-factor verification, enforcing MFA with strong authentication, monitoring for suspicious logins, and implementing advanced auditing controls to detect and prevent account takeover attempts.In summary, the document provides an in-depth look at APT929's continued targeting of Microsoft 365 to steal user credentials and email data, as well as new techniques to evade detection.","Here is a summary of the key points from the Mandiant report on APT29's targeting of Microsoft 365: The Russian state-sponsored hacking group APT29 continues to aggressively target organizations involved in shaping NATO countries' foreign policy.They frequently re-compromise victims they've breached previously.APT29 is demonstrating advanced tactics for evading detection and masking their activities in Microsoft 365 environments.They have been observed disabling logging features like Purview Audit on compromised accounts before collecting emails.This prevents logs that would show their mailbox access.The group is taking over dormant Microsoft 365 accounts by resetting passwords and quickly enrolling multi-factor authentication.This bypasses MFA protections.To hide their last-mile attacks, APT29 uses Azure virtual machines outside the victim's subscription.The Microsoft IP addresses are less likely to raise alerts.The group intersperses benign admin actions on accounts/apps among their malicious activity.This masquerades adversarial actions as legitimate administrator behavior.Overall, APT29 continues honing their tradecraft for stealthy Microsoft 365 intrusions.They rapidly adopt new techniques for accessing cloud environments while erasing their tracks."
"The PDF describes research by NCC Group tracking a peer-to-peer (P2P) malware network associated with the financially-motivated threat actor group TA505.TA505 emerged as an independent threat actor in 2014 and initially focused on banking fraud.In 2017, TA505 shifted to ransomware operations, using the Dridex banking malware platform and other tools like Bitpaymer and Clop for lateral movement and data theft.In early 2019, they started using the Clop ransomware alongside other tools such as ServHelper and ServHelper.The analysis found that the identified malware samples communicate with each other through UDP, suggesting they are part of a larger P2P network.The malware includes a remote access trojan (RAT) called Grace, which was used exclusively by TA505 in attacks starting in 2017.Technical analysis shows that the malware downloads and executes signed drivers, block lists, and other components from command and control servers located in at least 3 countries.The tools communicate with the C2 servers to receive commands and exfiltrate data.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, C2 IP addresses, and network IDs of the identified samples.It assesses with medium to high confidence that there is a connection between the developer(s) of Grace and TA505 based on similarities in development standards, programming style, and infrastructure.This suggests the developers of Grace are related to TA505 and the group's operations.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at the evolution and evolution of TA505's tactics, tools, infrastructure, and victimology from 2014-2019, shedding light on their shift from banking fraud to targeted ransomware operations.It highlights the importance of threat intelligence to detect and defend against evolving threats like ransomware.","The PDF describes research by NCC Group tracking a peer-to-peer (P2P) network used by the threat actor TA505, known for distribution of banking trojans and ransomware.The P2P network includes a downloader, signed driver, and node tool that communicate via UDP.The node tool exchanges records between peers.The programming style matches that of the GraceRAT malware used by TA505.The downloader fetches the other components from a command and control server, decrypts them, and installs them.The signed driver filters system information to avoid detection, injects the node tool payload, and reports back to the C2.The node tool communicates with other peers to exchange records containing metadata and encrypted payloads.The records appear to be used to distribute updates.While no interaction with GraceRAT was observed, the attribution to GraceRAT developers is based on code similarities.The research provides indicators of compromise on the components and notes that TA505 has shifted focus to ransomware operations for financial gain.The P2P network allows TA505 to distribute tools and updates while avoiding centralized infrastructure that could be taken down.The tools evolve but TA505 continues to pose a threat by compromising corporate networks."
"The document analyzes recent phishing campaigns targeting the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) using domains impersonating the WADA's legitimate domain wada-ama.org and a fake CAS domain tas-cas.org.The domains were recently registered and their registration and hosting information is consistent with Russian cyber espionage group Fancy Bear's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).The alert from WADA about compromised accounts of Russian athlete Yuliya Stepanova, who helped expose doping, and the hack of the CAS website by an unknown group are assessed to be part of targeted activity by Fancy Bear against individuals and organizations in response to WADA recommendations to ban Russian athletes from the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics.Successful operations against these individuals could facilitate Russian cyberespionage against them privately or publicly to intimidate them or potential whistleblowers.The alert follows news that WADA accounts and servers were compromised in mid-August 2016 by a group identifying themselves as Anonymous Poland/Anpoland.The group defaced the CAS site and leaked data stolen from the CAS and WADA servers.The WADA and CAS have shared indicators of compromise and recommendations on anti-doping rules and procedures.The report concludes that the phishing and compromise of athlete accounts likely part of Russian state-sponsored doping activity to influence public reporting and retaliation against those involved in the doping scandal.The threat actors behind Fancy Bear have been active since at least 2014 and continue to evolve their tactics.","The PDF discusses Russian cyber operations targeting the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in retaliation for the recommendation to ban all Russian athletes from the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games.- In mid-August 2016, WADA alerted stakeholders to phishing emails using spoofed domains that were found to be recently registered by addresses tied to the Russian cyber espionage group FANCY BEAR.- Another domain registered around the same time, tas-cass[.]org, was identified as spoofing CAS's domain.The registration and hosting details of these domains match known FANCY BEAR tactics.- The report suggests FANCY BEAR's operations against WADA and CAS are intended to facilitate Russian intelligence collection and influence operations in response to the recommended athlete ban.- In early August, a hacktivist group Anonymous Poland claimed to have hacked WADA and CAS servers and leaked data.However, Anonymous Poland appears inactive until end of July 2016 and evidence suggests the hackers may actually be of Russian origin.- The report concludes that organizations involved in events with negative implications for Russia can expect to experience cyber operations by Russia facilitating retaliatory influence or propaganda efforts.Knowledge of Russian APT tactics can help defend against such retaliation."
"The PDF describes research by FireEye on a sophisticated passive backdoor malware called LOWKEY used by a China-linked threat actor group called APT41.APT40 is a cyberespionage and financially-motivated group that targets industries like gaming, healthcare, technology, telecoms, and travel services.The report analyzes two variants of the Lowkey backdoor - a passive TCP and a passive HTTP backdoor targeting Internet Information Services (IIS).The backdoor uses RC5 encryption and a unique string ""f@Ukd!rCto R$.""as its encryption key.The RC5 key is constructed using the volume serial number of the C drive, which is XORed with a hard-coded constant and then converted to hex.The command and control (C2) server response is first RC5 decrypted with the key ""wsprintfA"", then RC5 encrypted with a different key and written to disk as <MODULE_NAME>.mui.If the index of the byte modulo 4 is zero, the hex conversion happens before the result is translated to hex and used to derive a key of up to 28 bytes in length.The key derivation is illustrated in Table 1.The second part of the analysis features position independent loaders that were observed in multiple samples, adding an additional layer of obfuscation.The third part is about the actual backdoor itself, which comes in two variants, a Passive TCP listener and a Passive HTTP listener targeting IIS.The backdoor can receive commands to execute commands, upload/download files, and execute shellcode.It can also receive commands from the C2 server.While the report provides technical details on the loaders and payloads, it emphasizes the importance of threat intelligence to detect and defend against sophisticated malware like Lowkey.","The PDF describes analysis of malware used by the threat actor group APT41.The malware uses multiple layers of encryption, including RC5 and RC4, to obfuscate payloads.Researchers were able to decrypt payloads by brute forcing RC5 keys derived from system volume serial numbers.This revealed additional obfuscation layers and full file paths/names from the malware developers.Decrypted payloads included the remote access trojan POISONPLUG, XMRig cryptocurrency miner, and a sophisticated passive backdoor named LOWKEY.LOWKEY has TCP and HTTP variants that covertly listen on ports 53 and 80.It uses named pipes for command and control.Commands support file management, process management, and a reverse shell.The TCP variant uses a rootkit component to intercept and forward traffic to LOWKEY.Overall, the malware uses advanced techniques like rootkits, traffic relay, and API hooking to evade detection.Decryption and analysis of the payloads revealed sophisticated capabilities and provided insights into APT41's development environment.The malware demonstrates APT41's continued evolution and investment into covert access tools."
"The document provides an overview of Kaspersky's anti-malware infrastructure and how their advanced algorithms ensure the best protection for businesses against cyber threats.It starts by emphasizing the importance of having a central ""cyberbrain"" powered by machine learning algorithms and expert human expertise to understand and apply these algorithms to detect advanced threats.For example, when a new undetected malware sample arrives, the researchers first search the VirusTotal Virus Collection for similar files, then use machine learning and location-specific hashing to identify and categorize detected malware samples.This avoids false positives.By unpacking and detecting a sample, the analyst creates a sort of ""center of gravity"" in the collection.Over time, other modified versions of the new sample will automatically gravitate towards this reference point.The heuristics-based system creates execution logs of all the samples, finds their common execution patterns, and creates a single execution-based heuristic record.The benefit of this approach is that new malware samples exhibiting similar behavior will be detected, even if the content includes some changes.Unlike this robot, an experienced human analyst can understand exactly what the sample is up to, despite any attempts to shake the heuristic system’s emulator off its trail.Robotic and human-made records then work in tandem, ensuring successful detection.To evade detection, the malefactor may change the functionality of malware functionality, but there are limitations: downloading a malicious file, saving the file and starting it (Trojan-Trojan.exe), downloading a file via the internet, starting an executable file, or mounting a file on the system lacking security solution lacking file protection.The best option is to give up and instead provide an integrated security solution with no more than 5 ways to start an attack against their business.This provides protection against all the threats detected.In summary, the document provides a comprehensive look at how Kaspersk's advanced algorithms work together to automatically detect and classify malware, avoiding false positives by using machine learning, location-sensitive hashing, sandboxing, and human expert analysis.","Here is a summary of the key points from the PDF document on Kaspersky's machine learning and human expertise for cybersecurity protection: The PDF outlines how Kaspersky combines automated machine learning algorithms with human expertise to provide effective cybersecurity protection.It describes several of the automated detection methods used by Kaspersky, including: - Classical signature-based detection that searches for similar malware samples in Kaspersky's database.New undetected samples are manually analyzed by experts to create detection signatures that can identify variants.- Heuristics-based detection that looks for common execution patterns across malware samples to create generalized detection rules.This can catch variants even if code is modified.- Behavior detection that monitors real-world execution for suspicious activities.It has unlimited timeframes to gather evidence before determining a detection.- Sandboxing executes suspicious files and studies behavior using granular logging.Machine learning analyzes the logs to find indicators and create detection records.Experts also craft custom behavioral records.- Smart records like decision trees and locality-sensitive hashing generalize detections across malware families using machine learning.They replace individual signature records.- Automatic in-lab systems handle initial analysis and classification.But human experts investigate ambiguous cases and emerging threats.Their expertise guides machine learning and creates behavioral records.- Multi-layered on-device and cloud-based protections work together.Lightweight cloud queries minimize traffic while still detecting variants.- False positives are tightly controlled through automated tracking of faulty records and human review.Experts continuously tune detection models and validate record performance.The combination of advanced machine learning and human expertise allows Kaspersky to provide cutting edge protection able to react to new threats without compromising accuracy.But new technologies are continually developed to stay ahead of evolving attacks."

"The document describes targeted cyberattack campaigns observed by Netskope that distribute malware through automated cloud syncing and sharing of files in the cloud.Attackers send emails with malicious attachments that are automatically synced to cloud storage using popular SaaS applications like Dropbox and Google Drive.The attachments are zipped and contain obfuscated JavaScript.Netskopes detected variations in the obfuscation techniques, payloads, and delivery methods indicating multiple malware families were used.The payloads included keyloggers, remote access trojans, and ransomware.Some samples would disable antivirus software, leaving the enterprise to rely on a remote scan engine like Netkope Threat Protection.The malware would then fetch additional payloads from command and control servers hosted on compromised domains mimicking the victim's IP address.The backdoors would allow the attackers to exfiltrate data like keystrokes, screenshots, audio recordings, and documents.The report analyzes the attack flow and detection methods, including: - Obfuscated JavaScript delivered via zip files that fetch malware payloads via hardcoded URLs.- Encrypted payloads delivered via encrypted zip files.- Customized JavaScript wrapper scripts that use encryption and encryption keys to hide the final payload.- Cloud-based cloud-based file sharing allows the malware to be shared across the enterprise without needing to be physically present on the system.This results in a ""malware fan-out"" effect spreading across the cloud environment.The attacks demonstrate the ongoing evolution of social engineering and multi-platform malware delivery techniques to bypass security controls and steal data from cloud storage providers.The document provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, domain names, IP addresses, and file hashes to detect the malware.It highlights the ongoing risk of targeted attacks in cloud environments and the importance of threat intelligence to detections and prevention.","The PDF discusses targeted cyberattack campaigns that Netskope Threat Research Labs observed in enterprise cloud environments.The attacks involved sending emails with zipped JavaScript attachments that would sync and share themselves via cloud storage apps.File names resembled recipients' email addresses to appear more legitimate when shared.The JavaScript attachments contained varying obfuscation techniques but ultimately dropped a remote access trojan, keylogger, or ransomware payload on the victim's system.Payloads included Adwind RAT, iSpy keylogger, and Locky ransomware variants.The automated file sharing spread the infection rapidly in the cloud.Netskope detected the attacks at multiple stages, including the initial zipped JavaScript attachment, obfuscated code, and final payload.The JavaScript exploited Windows Script Host to download the malicious payload and used domain generation algorithms to avoid blocking.Payloads employed anti-virus evasion and remote scanning resistance.To counter such threats, Netskope recommends detecting and remediating malware in sanctioned cloud apps, blocking unsanctioned cloud access, using remote file scanning, backing up critical data, avoiding suspicious attachments, tracking risky cloud usage, updating systems/AV, and enforcing data policies.The layered defense highlights the importance of cloud-based security to cover the entire attack chain."
"The document describes new activity by the financially-motivated threat actor group ITG08, also known as FIN6, which has been active since 2015 targeting POS systems and stealing payment card data from retailers and e-commerce sites.IBM researchers identified new attacks by ITG8 using the More_eggs backdoor malware, which is sold on the dark web by a malware-as-a-service provider.The group uses spear phishing emails with fake job ad lures to gain initial access, followed by emails containing links to download the malware.The malware establishes a reverse shell connection to the attacker's command and control infrastructure, allowing it to establish persistence and move laterally within the network.The attackers use a variety of adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to gain an initial foothold and persist on networks, including using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to automate remote execution of PowerShell scripts, PowerShell commands with base64 encoding, and Metasploit and PowerShell to deploy malware.They also use Comodo code-signing certificates to sign their malware.Many of these TTPs overlap with previous activity by FIN6 that has been reported on by other groups like Visa and Proofpoint.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, domains, IP addresses, and YARA rules associated with the group's previous campaigns.It concludes by emphasizing the ongoing risk of attacks by this group targeting multinational organizations.IBM has implemented detections and mitigations to detect and block the threat actor's activities.","The PDF describes an investigation by IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) into recent attacks by the financially motivated cybercrime group ITG08 (also known as FIN6).ITG08 has been active since 2015 targeting point-of-sale systems and hospitality companies in the US and Europe.The investigation found ITG08 used spear phishing emails with fake job ads to target specific employees and trick them into downloading malware.The main malware used was More_eggs, a backdoor sold on the dark web.Other tools included Metasploit for lateral movement and signed binaries and DLLs to establish persistence.Once initial access was gained, ITG08 moved laterally with Windows tools like WMI and PowerShell.They escalated privileges using Mimikatz and harvested credentials.The group also made heavy use of obfuscation techniques like base64 encoding.Based on the TTPs observed, IBM assesses with high confidence that ITG08 was behind this new campaign.The use of More_eggs and fake job ads links it to previous ITG08 activity reported in 2018-2019.The group continues to evolve, expanding from POS malware to card-not-present fraud.Mitigation tips include user education on phishing, monitoring for ITG08 IOCs and TTPs, controlling Windows tools often abused by attackers, and implementing strong password policies and 2FA.Regular pen testing and incident response exercises also help strengthen defenses."
"The report analyzes recent politically-motivated cyberattacks on Iranian critical infrastructure by a threat actor named Indra that targeted Iranian Railways and the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development systems in July 2021.The attacks occurred on July 9-10, 2021, and were attributed to a group identifying themselves as the regime opposition group Indra, also known as ""Indra-Hackers"".The attacks were tactically and technically similar to previous activity by Indra against private companies in Syria from 2019-2020.The report provides technical analysis of the malware tools used in the attacks, including versions of the Meteor, Stardust, and Comet wiper malware.It also analyzes the TTPs, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the attackers, which include: - Hacking the victim's network to gain initial access, moving laterally, and maintaining access for long periods of time before attempting to steal data.- Using social engineering tactics like message boards and social media to direct passengers to call a specific phone number for further information.- Disrupting websites of Iranian railway and road ministry websites to cause disruption.- Lateral movement through Iranian networks to gain access to high-value government and railway targets.- Evasion of detection by disabling security products like antivirus software.- Obfuscating and deleting files from the attacker's command and control servers to avoid detection.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at the tactics, tools, infrastructure, and attribution of the Indra hacking group behind the recent attacks on Iranian rail and road systems, linking it to prior activity in Syria and previous activity.Indra appears to have been active since at least 2019.While not a state-sponsored group, their tactics and tools match those of cybercriminal groups, but they may have ties to cybercriminals or hacker forums.The threat actors behind them are not sophisticated state-level actors.","The PDF describes an analysis by Check Point Research of recent cyberattacks against Iranian targets, including Iran's railway system and the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development.The attacks involved malicious software that displayed fake delay messages on station information boards and wiped systems.Check Point's investigation found similarities between these attacks and previous unclaimed attacks on Syrian companies in 2019-2020.All the attacks used a custom wiper malware dubbed Meteor, Stardust, or Comet in different versions.The PDF provides technical details on how the malware works to corrupt systems.The earlier attacks on Syrian companies were claimed by a group calling itself Indra.Indra has an online presence and claimed responsibility for attacks on Syrian companies it accused of ties to Iran's Quds Force.While Indra did not claim the recent Iran attacks, Check Point believes they are responsible based on similarities in target selection, tactics, and the custom malware used.The report concludes that non-state actors have the capability to conduct sophisticated and highly disruptive attacks previously assumed to be solely in the realm of state-sponsored groups.It warns that as non-state groups become more advanced, equivalent attacks could occur anywhere globally."
"The PDF describes a new OS X trojan called Komplex that is associated with the Sofacy cybercrime group targeting the aerospace industry.Researchers at Palo Alto Networks identified Komplex as part of a previous campaign targeting individuals running OS X using a MacKeeper antivirus software.Komplex shares code similarities with the Carberp malware used by Sofacy previously on Windows systems.It has multiple parts including a binder component that saves a second payload and decoy document to the system.Three versions of Komplex were found, with versions for x86, x64, and 64-bit architectures.The binder saves the next stage malware dropper and the decoy to persistence.The initial dropper in one version opens a PDF decoy file that executes another executable file saved as ""/tmp/content"".The second executable is the Komplex dropper used in the next phase of installation and to maintain persistence.It saves a Mach-O file to ""/temp/content"" to minimize suspicion.The binders would then save a legitimate PDF file and open it in the ""Preview"" mode to avoid suspicion.Infrastructure analysis found domains associated with Komplex domains overlapped with previously identified Sofacy phishing infrastructure.Sofacy continues to add new tools to their arsenal, targeting OS X systems as well as Windows.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, network IOCs, and YARA rules to detect and block the malware.","Researchers from Palo Alto Networks discovered a new OS X malware named Komplex that is associated with the cyberespionage group Sofacy, also known as APT28 or Fancy Bear.Komplex has multiple components for installation and persistence.It starts with a binder that drops a second executable and opens a decoy PDF document.The second executable saves the Komplex payload and a launch agent plist to achieve persistence.The payload gathers system info and communicates with C2 servers using encrypted HTTP requests.It can download other files, execute commands, and inject code into processes.Komplex shares code similarities with Sofacy's Carberp Windows malware, including encryption algorithms and C2 communication methods.It also uses infrastructure linked to prior Sofacy activity.The malware appears to target individuals in the aerospace industry.The initial infection vector involved exploiting the MacKeeper antivirus tool.In summary, Komplex is a new OS X Trojan associated with the Sofacy group that uses multi-stage installation, shared infrastructure, and overlaps with Windows malware, indicating a cross-platform cyberespionage toolset.2.If existing the process of the attack in this pdf, please extract it (use 1., 2., 3., etc.).Here is an outline of the attack process described in the PDF: 1.Sofacy sends a phishing email with a weaponized Excel document or exploits MacKeeper to gain initial access.2.The initial exploit or macro drops the Komplex binder component.3.The binder saves the Komplex dropper and opens a PDF decoy document.4.The dropper installs the full Komplex payload and creates a launch agent for persistence.5.The payload gathers system info and communicates with C2 servers to receive commands.6.Komplex can download more files, execute commands, inject code into processes per C2 instructions.7.The C2 commands allow the threat actor full control over the compromised system.8.Komplex maintains persistence by loading at system startup via the launch agent created by the dropper.In summary, the initial vector installs the binder, which escalates access for the dropper to deploy the full payload, completing the multi-stage installation and control process."
"The report analyzes Iran's cyber threat landscape and Iran's use of contractors and hackers to conduct offensive cyber operations following the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement with the Islamic Republic.It examines Iranian cyber operations from March 1-April 30, 2018 based on analysis of internet activity from various Iranian cyber institutes.Over 50 contractors are vying for Iranian government contracts, with the best being hired by the regime.This creates a quasi-capitalistic system where no one can be trusted and individuals with the greatest offensive cyber skills are mutually exclusive.The report assesses that Iran will likely rely more heavily on less trusted contractors to run its cyber operations after the withdrawal of the JCPOA sanctions against Iran.This could result in more destructive attacks.The contractors' businesses are likely to be in sectors vulnerable to Iranian cyberattacks, such as banks, financial services, government departments, critical infrastructure, and oil/energy.The Islamic Republic has historically used proxies like Hezbollah and Yemen rebels to conduct both cyber and physical attacks to achieve its foreign policy goals.The use of proxies and cyberattacks is consistent with Iran's strategic interests in pursuing regional conflict and retaliation against perceived threats.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at how Iran leverages contractors and hacktivists to conduct cyber operations in response to US sanctions on Iran.It highlights Iran's reliance on unsophisticated but highly qualified individuals rather than traditional state-sanctioned contractors.The analysis aims to expose the inner workings of Iran's hacker hierarchy.","The report profiles Iran's offensive cyber capabilities and contractor ecosystem.It assesses that Iran will likely retaliate with cyberattacks on Western businesses in response to the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.Iran has historically used proxies and contractors to conduct cyber operations that align with regime interests but offer some deniability.A tiered approach is used - trusted middlemen translate intelligence priorities into cyber tasks that are bid out to contractors.An ideologically aligned workforce is prioritized over pure technical capability.There are an estimated 50+ contractors competing for Iranian cyber projects.The IRGC and academic institutes also participate.Analysts looked at internet traffic of Iranian cyber institutes from March-April 2018.Suspicious activity was seen between Shahid Beheshti University ranges and Spanish/Philippine networks, and with a propaganda-linked cloud provider.When rapid cyber retaliation is required, Iran may use less trusted contractors, potentially limiting their control over the scope of attacks.Infrastructure and energy companies should monitor for fallout from Iranian geopolitical developments."
