"The document analyzes a malware strain called Raspberry Robin that uses several tricks to evade detection, including encryption, anti-analysis checks, and encryption checks.The malware, dubbed Roshtyak, is packed in an infinite loop and contains multiple layers of obfuscation.The fake payload uses control flow flattening, activation keys, and other tricks to hide its purpose.The obfuscation allows it to maintain persistence and elevated privileges.Additional obfuscation layers allow it to load additional payloads, use exploits, and execute commands on the fly.The main payload is a DLL backdoor that drops itself into a hardcoded process on startup.It uses PsExec for command and control, and can execute commands like fetching a random URL, fetching another process, and executing ROPs.It connects to a Tor server using a random name, downloads the payload, and uses a self-extracting package as a tool.The package contains a toolkit for downloading and executing payloads from the Tor Tor Tor network.The loader is a tool called iexpress.exe.It exfiltrates system info and registry data to a C2 server.Raspberry Robin is extremely prevalent, with over 550,000 reported infections this year alone.Avast protects over 550K users from Raspberry Robin through multi-layered multi-stage protections.The combination of heavy obfuscation, encryption, and anti-detection checks makes analysis and tracking difficult.The document aims to highlight Raspberry Robin's numerous advanced anti-Analysis tricks to help fellow researchers recognize and respond to similar malware strains.","The PDF discusses the malware Raspberry Robin, specifically focusing on its heavily protected DLL backdoor called Roshtyak.Roshtyak employs numerous advanced anti-analysis techniques to avoid detection, including anti-debugger, anti-sandbox, anti-VM, and anti-emulation checks.If any check succeeds in detecting the analysis environment, Roshtyak will terminate itself, crash intentionally, enter an infinite loop, or execute fake adware payload.The fake payload tricks analysts into thinking the malware is harmless.Roshtyak's code is heavily obfuscated through control flow flattening, function activation keys, variable masking, and other techniques.It is packed in up to 14 layers, each serving a specific protective purpose.The obfuscation hinders static analysis.The core functionality of Roshtyak is to establish persistence, escalate privileges, move laterally, and download additional payloads.The malware uses encrypted kernel exploits to escalate privileges, which are decrypted on demand.Roshtyak downloads PsExec on demand from a specific URL and drops it into a temporary directory under a random name.The payload to be executed by PsExec is a self-extracting package created by a tool called IExpress, which is an ancient Windows installer.It profiles victims by collecting system information and exfiltrating it to C2 servers over Tor.The servers can respond with new shellcode for execution.Reverse engineering Roshtyak is very challenging due to the combination of heavy obfuscation and numerous advanced anti-analysis tricks.The PDF aims to help fellow researchers recognize and respond to similar malware tricks, and harden analysis environments against the described evasion techniques."
"The document analyzes a cyberespionage campaign called UNC4191 conducted by a threat actor targeting targeted organizations primarily in Southeast Asia and Europe.The threat actor, tracked as having a China-linked nexus, uses initial infection via USB devices using malware like USB Drive.exe and removable drive.exe.The malware uses side-loading techniques like MISTCLOAK, DARKDEW, and BLUEHAZE to infect removable drives and exfiltrate data from air-gapped systems.Successful compromise led to the deployment of a renamed NCAT binary and execution of a reverse shell on the victim's system, providing backdoor access to the threat actor.The reverse shell communicates with a hardcoded command and control server to receive commands and execute payloads.Three new side-loaded malware families were observed, including a launcher, droppers, and a backdoor dropper.The group has been active since at least September 2021.Mandiant's Managed Defense product detects this activity using real-time threat hunting capabilities.In response, Mandiant developed YARA rules and Validation Actions to detect changes in tactics, techniques, and procedures that can evade detection.The report provides IOCs, TTPs, and detection opportunities based on the malware, infrastructure, and tools Mandiant observed.","The PDF describes a cyberespionage campaign called UNC4191 that targeted organizations primarily in Southeast Asia, as well as some in the US, Europe, and Asia Pacific.The threat actor has a suspected China nexus.Initial infection vectored used USB devices.Malicious binaries named USB Drive.exe or Removable Drive.exe were executed by users when plugging in compromised USB drives.The binaries sideloaded and executed the malware MISTCLOAK, DARKDEW, and BLUEHAZE.MISTCLOAK decrypts and executes DARKDEW from an encrypted file on the USB drive.DARKDEW self-replicates by infecting any new USB drives plugged into the compromised system.It steals data from air-gapped systems this way.BLUEHAZE uses a signed binary to sideload itself.It opens a reverse shell to a command and control server using NCAT.Successful compromise allows the threat actor to maintain persistent access and carry out intelligence collection.The campaign appears to have started around September 2021 based on compile timestamps of the malware samples.New detections were created in Managed Defense to identify this activity, enabling rapid response.Indicators of compromise are provided.Mandiant will continue monitoring the campaign and provide updates on changes in TTPs or new tools."
"The report details mobile surveillance malware campaigns targeting the Uyghur ethnic minority group in China and beyond.Researchers from Lookout discovered in June 2020 that Chinese mobile threat actors use Android surveillanceware called SilkBean, CarbonSteal, DoubleAgent, and GoldenEagle.The campaigns have been active since at least 2013, but Lookout researchers have been tracking them since 2015.By examining the surveillanceware apps, their signing certificates, and supporting command and control infrastructure, Lookout found connections between the four main Android malware families - SilkBeans, DarthPusher, Spywaller, and pluginPhantom - and other mobile malware used by the same group or individuals.Lookout believes these tools are part of a larger mobile advanced persistent threat (MAPT) operation linked to Chinese state-sponsored groups.While the main target appears to be in China, these tools have been used to target other ethnic groups, likely due to contentious relationships between China and Tibetans.The first samples of DoubleAgent samples were found in 2019 but continued development until at least 2017.DoubleAgent is a remote access trojan that can capture video and audio surveillance, as well as keylogging, screenshots, and other data exfiltration capabilities.It has been actively used to track and exfiltrate data from Android devices across multiple languages, likely to target the UYghur community in China but also beyond.Analysis of the shared infrastructure and code links the four malware families to the same actor or groups.The report concludes that the four Android surveillance malware families represent a sophisticated, long-running mobile surveillance campaign by a Chinese threat actor, likely motivated by Chinese national security interests.It provides indicators of compromise and recommendations for security teams to detect and defend against this threat.","The PDF report details mobile surveillance campaigns targeting Uyghurs using Android malware tools.It was written by security researchers at Lookout in June 2020.The report focuses on four interconnected Android surveillanceware tools - SilkBean, DoubleAgent, CarbonSteal, and GoldenEagle - which have been used in long-running campaigns against Uyghurs since at least 2013.SilkBean is a small but sophisticated remote access trojan (RAT) used to target Uyghurs.It has been active since at least 2015.SilkBean shares infrastructure links with other malware like DarthPusher, HenBox, and PluginPhantom, suggesting the same group is behind these tools.DoubleAgent is an advanced Android RAT used against groups with contentious relationships with China, like Tibetans.It has spying capabilities and first appeared in 2013.New DoubleAgent samples from 2019 show continued development and targeting of Uyghurs.CarbonSteal is Android spyware tracked since 2017, focused on audio surveillance.It has infrastructure links to HenBox malware and shares certificates with DoubleAgent, DarthPusher, and other tools, again pointing to the same coordinated group.GoldenEagle is Android spyware potentially dating back to 2012.It impersonates a wide array of apps and has sophisticated data exfiltration capabilities.Links have been found between GoldenEagle, CarbonSteal, and other tools.In total, the report details a long-running, sophisticated mobile spying campaign primarily targeting the Uyghur community globally.The shared infrastructure and code links between the four malware families indicate the same Chinese state-sponsored advanced persistent threat actor is coordinating these efforts."

"The report by Mandiant details the investigation of malware infections targeting VMware ESXi and ESXi hypervisors by a threat actor they call UNC3886.The malware allows persistent administrative access to the hypervisor and allows the attacker to send commands to the host VM to execute on the guest VM.Mandiant analyzed ESXi boot profiles and found two new malware families - VIBs (vSphere Installation Bundles) - named VIRTUALPITA and VIBUALPIE - that were installed through malicious vSphere installer files (VIBs).The VIBS allow the malware to persist across ESXi, Linux vCenter systems, and Windows virtual machines.The report provides technical analysis of the VIB payloads - a.vgz archive that contains directories and files that will be executed on boot.It also contains VIB files that check if the ESXi host is PartnerSupported or CommunitySupported before executing.The --force flag is used to create a listener for arbitrary command execution.Python scripts were also found that had similar capabilities.The infection vector was found by analyzing the VMware Tools process vmtoolsd.exe, which was used to distribute the malware through VIBB files.The Python scripts communicate with command and control servers to receive commands and exfiltrate files from ESXi to guest VM execution.The attack shows state-sponsored actors are increasingly targeting ESXi systems as part of their evolving malware arsenal.As endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions improve malware detection on Windows systems, these actors are shifting to ESXi environments to deploy malware that can evade detection.In summary, the report analyzes an ESXi malware infection vector that leveraged malicious VIB(E) packages to maintain persistence across hypervisor environments and guest VM operations.","The PDF document from Mandiant details the investigation of novel malware being deployed on VMware ESXi hypervisors by a threat actor tracked as UNC3886.The malware ecosystem enables persistent administrative access to the hypervisor, command execution on guest VMs, file transfers between the hypervisor and VMs, tampering with logs, and executing commands between VMs on the same hypervisor.The malware was initially detected when commands were seen coming from the vmtoolsd process on a Windows VM hosted on an ESXi hypervisor.Analysis of the ESXi boot profiles revealed malicious VIBs (vSphere Installation Bundles) being used to deploy backdoors called VIRTUALPITA and VIRTUALPIE on the hypervisors after reboot.The VIBs were signed as PartnerSupported though they were actually CommunitySupported, allowing installation with the --force flag.VIRTUALPITA creates a listener on the hypervisor for arbitrary command execution, file transfers, and starting/stopping logging.VIRTUALPIE is a Python backdoor with similar capabilities.Commands executed on the hypervisor are sent to guest VMs via vmtoolsd.exe for execution.This was used for file enumeration, compression, and credential dumping.VARIUALPITA samples were also found on Linux vCenter systems masquerading as a legitimate process.Windows VMs hosted on the compromised hypervisors contained VIRTUALGATE, a utility that uses VMCI sockets to run commands on guest VMs from the hypervisor.Based on the nature of the intrusions, Mandiant assesses UNC3886 has a likely China nexus and espionage motivations.Indicators of compromise, Yara rules, and recommendations for hardening ESXi/vSphere environments are provided."
"The PDF describes research by Gemini into the activities of the Fin7 cybercrime group, also known as ""BadUSB"" or ""Rubber Ducky.""Fin7 has been conducting cyberattacks using malware installed on USB devices disguised as Arduino ""sketches"" to infect systems.The sketches emulate keyboards and send keystrokes to trigger a PowerShell script that downloads and executes the IceBot Remote Access Trojan (RAT) malware.Analysis of the RAT's command and control servers revealed a control panel with a list of infected systems and an IP address for managing infected systems.FIN7 used 9 USB USB devices and 3 command-and-control servers to host its malware payloads and a network-facing control panel to manage infected systems, with one of the servers hosting a remote access trojan.The RAT allows FIN7 to gain remote access to infected systems without needing to install OS or firewalls, allowing them to move laterally through the network undetected.Fin7 leverages the Arduino sketch language for encoding, decoding, and executing scripts and files on trojanized USBs to evade detection.They use the Arduino platform and USB devices to build malware-as-a-service tools that connect to file repositories and download additional payloads.The malware allows them to steal data from victims' systems and exfiltrate it to remote servers.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, YARA rules, and MITRE ATT&CK tests to identify FIN7's tools and infrastructure.The group continues to evolve their tactics, evolving from simple USB malware to more advanced ransomware.The PDF analyzes FIN7.","The cybercrime group FIN7 has been using ""BadUSB"" attacks to spread malware.They distribute USB devices containing malicious Arduino sketches that act as keyboards.When plugged in, the sketch executes PowerShell to download and install the IceBot remote access trojan (RAT).This allows FIN7 to gain unauthorized access to target networks.Analysis of the sketch code shows it opens a hidden PowerShell window to download the trojan from IP addresses linked to FIN7.The RAT then connects to FIN7 command and control servers.A control panel was discovered showing systems infected with IceBot, including info like IP, OS, antivirus, and options to interact with the RAT.This attack method avoids firewalls and email filters by not transmitting malware over the network.Encoding and scripts minimize malware files for stealth.FIN7 recently created a fake security company potentially to construct trojanized USBs.They may be using unwitting admins or sending them to clients for social engineering.The USB-based attack represents an evolution in tactics for FIN7 to gain persistent access and evade protections as they expand into ransomware operations.Defenses should focus on physical media controls and monitoring for suspicious USB activities."
"The report describes a targeted malware campaign called Operation Greedywonk that compromised websites focused on economic, foreign policy, and national security.Visitors to three nonprofit organizations were redirected to an exploit server that hosted a zero-day Flash exploit.The exploit bypassed Windows' Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protections on Windows XP, Windows 7, Java, and Microsoft Office 2007/2010.It redirected users to exploit servers run by a threat actor group called Kaba.This campaign appears to be related to previous activity by Kaba based on tactics, tradecraft, and infrastructure similarities.Kaba exploited Flash zero-days like CVE-2014-0502 to gain initial access and execute arbitrary code.The group appears to have sufficient resources and motivation to target foreign policy and defense sites, making them a credible threat.The actor behind GreedyWonk is believed to have extensive resources and a focus on long-term persistence, likely for early access to malware families.Mitigation involves updating Office, upgrading to latest versions, updating Java, or updating Microsoft Office if Java 1.6 or 1.7 is no longer supported.In summary, the report details a sophisticated, targeted malware attack against economic and foreign policy websites by an unidentified threat actor, likely tied to Kaba, that exploited a Flash vulnerability to bypass Windows' address space layout randomization protections.The attack shows Kaba continues to operate and evolve based on tradecraft similarities with previous campaigns.","The document describes an attack campaign dubbed ""Operation GreedyWonk"" that was discovered in February 2014.The campaign involved compromising multiple websites related to economic policy, foreign affairs, and national security.Visitors to these compromised sites were redirected to an exploit server hosting a zero-day Flash exploit (CVE-2014-0502).The goal was to infect visitors, especially those interested in defense and public policy matters, with malware for follow-on data theft.The exploit bypassed Windows ASLR protections by targeting systems still running Windows XP or having outdated Java and Microsoft Office.Once the exploit succeeded, it installed a remote access trojan called PlugX/Kaba.This malware variant was compiled shortly before discovery, indicating it was specifically built for this campaign.Researchers believe GreedyWonk may be connected to an earlier 2012 campaign that used similar tradecraft and infrastructure.Malware samples from both campaigns connected to overlapping domains that previously resolved to the same IP addresses.The group behind the campaigns appears sufficiently resourced to access zero-days and remains a credible threat.The report highlights the actor's persistence in compromising policy and defense-related websites, early access to exploits, ability to re-compromise sites, and deployment of various malware families.This demonstrates an adversary with mature capabilities that continues to pose a threat through strategic web compromises to infect visitors from specific communities."
"The PDF describes a malware campaign called Operation In(ter)ception by the threat actor group Lazarus.It was discovered on August 16, 2022, targeting the cryptocurrency exchange company Coinbase.A signed Mac executable disguised as a job description for Coinbase was uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil.It drops a PDF decoy, a bundle FinderFontsUpdater.app, and a downloader safarifontagent.app.The bundle is signed using a certificate issued in February 2022 but revoked on August 12.The downloader connects to a different C&C server.The decoy is similar to one found in May 2022, but the Windows version uses a different font.The malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon and drops three files: a decoy PDF document, bundle app, and downloader.It is not yet publicly known if it is part of Lazarus' Mac campaign, but it appears to be part of their broader targeting.","ESET researchers discovered a new malware campaign targeting Mac users that is attributed to the Lazarus threat group.On August 16, 2022, ESET announced on Twitter that a signed Mac executable disguised as a Coinbase job description was uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil.This is similar to a campaign ESET uncovered in May 2022 originating from Singapore.The malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures.It drops three files: a PDF job description decoy, a bundle called FinderFontsUpdater.app, and a downloader called safarifontagent.The bundle is signed with a certificate issued in February 2022 that Apple revoked on August 12, 2022.Unlike the May campaign, this version connects to a different command and control server at concrecapital[.]com.The server did not respond when analyzed.On August 4, 2022, another security researcher found a Windows version dropping the same PDF and connecting to a different C2.ESET believes this new activity is part of Lazarus' Operation In(ter)ception campaign targeting Mac users.The malware bypasses security products by disguising itself as a legitimate job application.The use of code signing and targeting of cryptocurrency companies indicates the likely purpose is cyberespionage and financial theft.ESET provided hashes for the dropped files and C2 domain to help identify infections.They assess this demonstrates Lazarus' continued efforts to breach MacOS devices through social engineering and Trojanized applications."
"The PDF describes research by Talos on analyzing malware samples submitted to their Anubis sandbox and Cisco's Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) datasets.Anubis is an automated, dynamic threat detection system used by security firms to automatically find malware samples for analysis.Analysis of the Talos samples revealed that some advanced persistent threat (APT) malware samples were submitted to Anubis months before security firms could attribute them to proper APT campaigns.This suggests the malware authors directly interacted with the sandbox during the development phase of the threats.Some of the malware samples used in sophisticated attacks had been submitted to the sandbox months before attribution was made, while others were mislabeled and mislabelled as legitimate malware.The Talos malware samples span 6.5 years, with some campaigns spanning multiple countries and affecting organizations in Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Asia.The analysis shows that attribution to specific APT groups is difficult but can be made by connecting the dots between malware samples and the threat actor based on similarities in timestamps, Yara rules, and other technical details found in the samples.Talos provides an overview of the analysis of the samples and telemetry from the Cisco AMP datasets.The PDF concludes that while detection of APT malware often takes months or years, attribution can be achieved quickly if attribution is made after the threat is made public.In summary, the PDF provides an in-depth look at analysis of malware samples from the Anubis and Cisco datasets to uncover the activities of sophisticated APT actors behind some of their most persistent threat campaigns.It reveals that attribution is often difficult but not impossible.","The PDF is a blog post by Cisco Talos describing their analysis of past APT malware campaigns in their threat intelligence datasets.They looked at 10 major APT campaigns made public between 2010-2015, including campaigns like Aurora, Equation, Red October etc.Attribution is not discussed.They searched for these malware samples in the Talos malware zoo (feeds from AV companies, researchers etc.)and found samples for most campaigns existed in their zoo months or years before public disclosure of the APT campaigns.On average, it took 458 days after initial detection for samples to be publicly tied to an APT campaign.The gap was as high as 3 years for Equation samples.Analysis of VirusTotal submitters showed certain entities had submitted samples from multiple campaigns, indicating possible links between campaigns or actors.In the Cisco AMP customer telemetry, they found pre-dated samples related to 3 campaigns.Most were detected as malicious when first seen, but some evaded initial detection.The post concludes that while detection happens quickly, connecting samples to campaigns takes longer due to high volumes of generic malware.Sandbox evasion also delays detection.Their findings validate that threat actors submit samples to test defenses prior to attacks.Better analytics are needed to identify and correlate samples early to discover stealthy campaigns in progress."
"The report provides an overview of the major ransomware threats in 2017 compared to 2016, compared to previous years.It shows that despite fewer major ransomware families emerging in 2017, major global attacks like WannaCry and Petya occurred, resulting in billions of dollars in damage.Known vulnerabilities like EternalBlue and business email compromise (BEC) were exploited, with BEC increasing in popularity in the second half of the year compared to the first half of 2016.Meanwhile, cryptocurrency-related threats like BEC also increased as cybercriminals reworked old techniques to take advantage of the crypto-trends.Overall threats like ransomware decreased overall, but there was a shift to more sophisticated ransomware like ransomware-as-a-service (RAT) and zero-day vulnerabilities.BECs remained a consistent threat for enterprises, with zero data breaches reported across large and small firms.However, awareness of BEC scams increased as companies became more aware of the risk of them.The report also notes that despite the rise in awareness of ransomware, large-scale attacks continued to occur.It recommends enterprises implement multilayered security solutions like endpoint detection, behavior monitoring, and application control to defend against it.In summary, the report provides a comprehensive overview of major ransomware trends in 2017 showing the continued evolution of major global outbreaks but fewer major families emerging.It highlights the need for comprehensive security solutions to detect, defend against, and mitigate these threats across the full range of threats.","The document provides an overview of major cybersecurity threats and trends in 2017 compared to 2016.Ransomware continued to be a major threat, with more new families emerging but fewer large-scale attacks than 2016.Major outbreaks like WannaCry and Petya caused more damage globally than typical ransomware.Known vulnerabilities like EternalBlue were exploited for ransomware campaigns.Business email compromise scams also increased significantly, doubling in the second half of 2017 compared to the first half.Cryptocurrency became a big target for cybercriminals as bitcoin valuations skyrocketed.They used social engineering and evolved old ransomware to steal cryptocurrency.Coin mining malware also emerged to abuse the rise in cryptocurrencies.Overall threats blocked by Trend Micro dropped from 2016, indicating a shift from broad attacks to more targeted ones.But data breaches disclosed affected even more records, including major breaches at Yahoo.The report highlights key threats like ransomware, business email compromise scams, cryptocurrency abuse, and data breaches.It notes the shift from broad spam campaigns to more targeted attacks.It advises using security solutions with capabilities like machine learning, behavior monitoring, and application control to detect latest threats."
