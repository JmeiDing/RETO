"The PDF analyzes the malware Roshtyak, which is associated with the Raspberry Robin worm.It is a DLL backdoor that uses multiple layers of obfuscation and anti-analysis tricks to evade detection and analysis.The obfuscation includes hardcoded anti-debugging checks, anti-sandbox checks, checks to avoid analysis, and an infinite loop to avoid detection.The fake payload uses control flow flattening and activation keys to hide its purpose in the obfuscation.It has a hardcoded persistence mechanism to persist itself and escalate privileges.In addition to persistence, it can use the exploit process to execute arbitrary code to load additional payloads, such as a remote access trojan (RAT) payload.The RAT payload uses a custom exploit to hijack the system process and execute commands on demand, like PsExec and ROP.It connects to a command and control server and retrieves additional modules from the C2 using a random name.The payload is a self-extracting package that installs a tool called iexpress on infected systems.It exfiltrates files and information to disk to maintain persistence and prevent execution.The PDF provides an in-depth analysis of reverse engineering and analysis of the ROP payload.It reveals the combination of heavy obfuscation, multiple layers, and evasion techniques that make analysis and detection difficult.In summary, the PDF provides a comprehensive look at the RAT capabilities, obfuscation tricks, and numerous advanced techniques used by Raspberry Robin and other malware strains.It aims to highlight the tricks and techniques to help fellow researchers recognize and defend against similar techniques.","The PDF discusses the malware Raspberry Robin, specifically focusing on its heavily protected DLL backdoor called Roshtyak.Roshtyak employs numerous advanced anti-analysis techniques to avoid detection, including anti-debugger, anti-sandbox, anti-VM, and anti-emulation checks.If any check succeeds in detecting the analysis environment, Roshtyak will terminate itself, crash intentionally, enter an infinite loop, or execute fake adware payload.The fake payload tricks analysts into thinking the malware is harmless.Roshtyak's code is heavily obfuscated through control flow flattening, function activation keys, variable masking, and other techniques.It is packed in up to 14 layers, each serving a specific protective purpose.The obfuscation hinders static analysis.The core functionality of Roshtyak is to establish persistence, escalate privileges, move laterally, and download additional payloads.The malware uses encrypted kernel exploits to escalate privileges, which are decrypted on demand.Roshtyak downloads PsExec on demand from a specific URL and drops it into a temporary directory under a random name.The payload to be executed by PsExec is a self-extracting package created by a tool called IExpress, which is an ancient Windows installer.It profiles victims by collecting system information and exfiltrating it to C2 servers over Tor.The servers can respond with new shellcode for execution.Reverse engineering Roshtyak is very challenging due to the combination of heavy obfuscation and numerous advanced anti-analysis tricks.The PDF aims to help fellow researchers recognize and respond to similar malware tricks, and harden analysis environments against the described evasion techniques."
"The document analyzes cyberespionage activity attributed to a threat actor group called UNC4191 that has targeted organizations primarily in Southeast Asia and Europe.The threat actor, assessed to have a China-centred motive, uses initial infection via USB devices, typically USB Drive.exe or removable drive.exe.The malware payloads are signed legitimate binaries like MISTCLOAK, DARKDEW, and BLUEHAZE.The initial infection vector allows the malware to propagate to additional systems and potentially collect data from air-gapped systems.Successful compromise led to the deployment of a renamed NCAT binary and execution of a reverse shell on the victim’s system, providing backdoor access to the threat actor.The reverse shell communicates with a hardcoded command and control server to exfiltrate data.The group uses signed binaries like NCAT to side-load malware, which self-replicates after successful compromise.This allows them to maintain access and continue intelligence collection.The campaign has been ongoing since at least September 2021.Mandiant Managed Defense detects this activity using real-time threat hunting capabilities and provides threat response alerts.In response, Mandiant has implemented changes to detect this activity based on TTPs, techniques, and procedures.The report provides IOCs, YARA rules, and detection opportunities for detection.In summary, the document provides an in-depth look at the tactics, tools, infrastructure, and motivations of the China-linked threat actor behind the recent spearphishing campaign against organizations in the Philippines.It highlights the need for proactive threat hunting to detect and mitigate this threat.","The PDF describes a cyberespionage campaign called UNC4191 that targeted organizations primarily in Southeast Asia, as well as some in the US, Europe, and Asia Pacific.The threat actor has a suspected China nexus.Initial infection vectored used USB devices.Malicious binaries named USB Drive.exe or Removable Drive.exe were executed by users when plugging in compromised USB drives.The binaries sideloaded and executed the malware MISTCLOAK, DARKDEW, and BLUEHAZE.MISTCLOAK decrypts and executes DARKDEW from an encrypted file on the USB drive.DARKDEW self-replicates by infecting any new USB drives plugged into the compromised system.It steals data from air-gapped systems this way.BLUEHAZE uses a signed binary to sideload itself.It opens a reverse shell to a command and control server using NCAT.Successful compromise allows the threat actor to maintain persistent access and carry out intelligence collection.The campaign appears to have started around September 2021 based on compile timestamps of the malware samples.New detections were created in Managed Defense to identify this activity, enabling rapid response.Indicators of compromise are provided.Mandiant will continue monitoring the campaign and provide updates on changes in TTPs or new tools."
"The report details a series of mobile malware campaigns targetinging Uyghurs that researchers at Lookout discovered in June 2020.The campaigns use Android surveillanceware called SilkBean, CarbonSteal, GoldenEagle, and others that have been active since at least 2013, with a peak in activity in 2015.Lookout researchers found links between these malware families and other Android tools like DarthPusher, HenBox, Spywaller, and pluginPhantom, which they believe may be operated by the same group.These tools have been used by multiple groups, suggesting contentious relationships between China and Tibetans.The first two DoubleAgent samples were found in 2019, with CarbonSteal in development since 2017.DoubleAgent is a remote access trojan that allows video and audio surveillance.Analysis of signing certificates revealed connections between it and 12 other Android apps used by other Chinese groups targeting the UYghur community, suggesting shared infrastructure and code reuse.The four malware families' development timeline and targeting align with Chinese national security efforts.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, domains, and YARA rules associated with the campaigns.It concludes that while the main target appears to be the Chinese-Uyghur ethnic minority, these tools have also been used to target other groups globally, likely in response to China's ""sensitive countries"" policy.","The PDF report details mobile surveillance campaigns targeting Uyghurs using Android malware tools.It was written by security researchers at Lookout in June 2020.The report focuses on four interconnected Android surveillanceware tools - SilkBean, DoubleAgent, CarbonSteal, and GoldenEagle - which have been used in long-running campaigns against Uyghurs since at least 2013.SilkBean is a small but sophisticated remote access trojan (RAT) used to target Uyghurs.It has been active since at least 2015.SilkBean shares infrastructure links with other malware like DarthPusher, HenBox, and PluginPhantom, suggesting the same group is behind these tools.DoubleAgent is an advanced Android RAT used against groups with contentious relationships with China, like Tibetans.It has spying capabilities and first appeared in 2013.New DoubleAgent samples from 2019 show continued development and targeting of Uyghurs.CarbonSteal is Android spyware tracked since 2017, focused on audio surveillance.It has infrastructure links to HenBox malware and shares certificates with DoubleAgent, DarthPusher, and other tools, again pointing to the same coordinated group.GoldenEagle is Android spyware potentially dating back to 2012.It impersonates a wide array of apps and has sophisticated data exfiltration capabilities.Links have been found between GoldenEagle, CarbonSteal, and other tools.In total, the report details a long-running, sophisticated mobile spying campaign primarily targeting the Uyghur community globally.The shared infrastructure and code links between the four malware families indicate the same Chinese state-sponsored advanced persistent threat actor is coordinating these efforts."

"Mandiant conducted the investigation into a novel malware infection technique targeting VMware ESXi and ESXi hypervisors that was discovered by a threat actor named UNC3886.The malware allows persistent administrative access to the hypervisor and allows the threat actor to maintain control of the hypervisors, send commands to the guest VM, transfer files between the two, and execute arbitrary commands from one VM to the other.This is a first for Windows virtual machines.When ESXi hosts boot files, the malware installs malicious vSphere Installation Bundles (VIBs) to maintain persistence.Two new malware families were identified - VIRTUALPITA and VIRATUALPIE - which use the VIBs as part of a multi-stage infection process starting with the PartnerSupported (C2) level to install the --force flag, which acts as a listener for arbitrary command execution.The VIB payloads are Python scripts that have similar capabilities to the legitimate VMware tool vmtoolsd.exe.They use compression and decompression techniques to avoid detection.Samples were found targeting Linux vCenter systems as well.The initial infection vector is unclear but could originate from the VMCI group, which Mandiant believes is linked to Chinese state-sponsored groups.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at how a novel ESXi malware infection tactic allows persistent access and command execution across virtual machines without needing to deploy malware directly.It highlights the need for security measures to detect and prevent this threat.","The PDF document from Mandiant details the investigation of novel malware being deployed on VMware ESXi hypervisors by a threat actor tracked as UNC3886.The malware ecosystem enables persistent administrative access to the hypervisor, command execution on guest VMs, file transfers between the hypervisor and VMs, tampering with logs, and executing commands between VMs on the same hypervisor.The malware was initially detected when commands were seen coming from the vmtoolsd process on a Windows VM hosted on an ESXi hypervisor.Analysis of the ESXi boot profiles revealed malicious VIBs (vSphere Installation Bundles) being used to deploy backdoors called VIRTUALPITA and VIRTUALPIE on the hypervisors after reboot.The VIBs were signed as PartnerSupported though they were actually CommunitySupported, allowing installation with the --force flag.VIRTUALPITA creates a listener on the hypervisor for arbitrary command execution, file transfers, and starting/stopping logging.VIRTUALPIE is a Python backdoor with similar capabilities.Commands executed on the hypervisor are sent to guest VMs via vmtoolsd.exe for execution.This was used for file enumeration, compression, and credential dumping.VARIUALPITA samples were also found on Linux vCenter systems masquerading as a legitimate process.Windows VMs hosted on the compromised hypervisors contained VIRTUALGATE, a utility that uses VMCI sockets to run commands on guest VMs from the hypervisor.Based on the nature of the intrusions, Mandiant assesses UNC3886 has a likely China nexus and espionage motivations.Indicators of compromise, Yara rules, and recommendations for hardening ESXi/vSphere environments are provided."
"The report provides an analysis of malware used by the Fin7 cybercrime group to spread remote access trojan (RAT) malware via USB devices that are disguised as Arduino-based ""sketch"" microcontrollers masquerading as keyboards.The sketch sends keystrokes to execute a PowerShell script that downloads and installs the IceBot RAT from an IP address 206.190.114.114, which communicates with a command and control server containing a control panel to manage infected systems.The RAT allows FIN7 to gain unauthorized remote access to infected systems and execute commands like keylogging, screenshot capture, file exfiltration, and command execution.Analysis of the command panel revealed 9 IP addresses that host the RAT payload and 3 FIN7 command-and-control servers, one of which contains information about infected systems including IP addresses, domains, and IP addresses associated with FIN7's infrastructure.FIN7 leverages USB devices disguised as keyboards to trick users into thinking they are USB keyboards and injecting keystroke injection malware called ""BadUSB"" or ""Rubber Ducky"" attacks.The attack flows capitalize on Windows user behavior of automatically trusting USB keyboards.Fin7 exploits the default USB keyboard behavior of Windows systems to bypass firewalls and inject malware into USB devices.The network traffic is encrypted and compressed before encoding to avoid detection.The report provides technical details on the attack flow, encoding schemes, scripts, files, and commands sent via trojanized USBs, command panel, and infrastructure used by Fin7 to infect systems.It also covers detection methods like file hashes, clients, and ransomware.In summary, the report provides in-depth analysis of Fin7's use of USB keyloggers, malware, encryption, and other technical details.","The cybercrime group FIN7 has been using ""BadUSB"" attacks to spread malware.They distribute USB devices containing malicious Arduino sketches that act as keyboards.When plugged in, the sketch executes PowerShell to download and install the IceBot remote access trojan (RAT).This allows FIN7 to gain unauthorized access to target networks.Analysis of the sketch code shows it opens a hidden PowerShell window to download the trojan from IP addresses linked to FIN7.The RAT then connects to FIN7 command and control servers.A control panel was discovered showing systems infected with IceBot, including info like IP, OS, antivirus, and options to interact with the RAT.This attack method avoids firewalls and email filters by not transmitting malware over the network.Encoding and scripts minimize malware files for stealth.FIN7 recently created a fake security company potentially to construct trojanized USBs.They may be using unwitting admins or sending them to clients for social engineering.The USB-based attack represents an evolution in tactics for FIN7 to gain persistent access and evade protections as they expand into ransomware operations.Defenses should focus on physical media controls and monitoring for suspicious USB activities."
"The PDF describes a targeted cyberattack campaign called Operation GreedyWonk that compromised websites focused on national security and foreign policy, redirecting visitors to an exploit server hosting a Flash zero-day exploit.The attack leveraged a previously unknown vulnerability in Flash CVE-2014-0502, assigned to a target organization.The target was the Peterson Institute, which focuses on defense and public policy matters, likely for follow-on data theft.The exploit bypassed Windows' Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protections to bypass Windows XP, Windows 7, Java 1.6, and Microsoft Office 2007/2010.It also exploited a vulnerability in HXDS.dll, which was patched in 2013.The group behind this campaign appears to have sufficient resources (such as access to zero-days) and a determination to infect visitors to foreign and national policy websites, likely to steal sensitive information related to defense and policy matters.This campaign shares tactics, techniques, and infrastructure with previous ShadowServer campaigns, suggesting a possible link based on tradecraft, infrastructure links, and malware configuration properties.The report provides indicators of compromise like domain names, IP addresses, and file hashes associated with the group.It concludes that this group is a credible threat actor with the resources to maintain persistence and early access to new exploits and malware families.Recommended mitigations include patching the exploit, disabling ASLR protections, and upgrading from Windows XP to newer versions of Office and Java.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at the technical details of the attack tactics, capabilities, and potential links between this campaign and prior ShadowServer activity.It reveals a sophisticated, long-running cyberespionage operation targeting foreign policy and national security sites.","The document describes an attack campaign dubbed ""Operation GreedyWonk"" that was discovered in February 2014.The campaign involved compromising multiple websites related to economic policy, foreign affairs, and national security.Visitors to these compromised sites were redirected to an exploit server hosting a zero-day Flash exploit (CVE-2014-0502).The goal was to infect visitors, especially those interested in defense and public policy matters, with malware for follow-on data theft.The exploit bypassed Windows ASLR protections by targeting systems still running Windows XP or having outdated Java and Microsoft Office.Once the exploit succeeded, it installed a remote access trojan called PlugX/Kaba.This malware variant was compiled shortly before discovery, indicating it was specifically built for this campaign.Researchers believe GreedyWonk may be connected to an earlier 2012 campaign that used similar tradecraft and infrastructure.Malware samples from both campaigns connected to overlapping domains that previously resolved to the same IP addresses.The group behind the campaigns appears sufficiently resourced to access zero-days and remains a credible threat.The report highlights the actor's persistence in compromising policy and defense-related websites, early access to exploits, ability to re-compromise sites, and deployment of various malware families.This demonstrates an adversary with mature capabilities that continues to pose a threat through strategic web compromises to infect visitors from specific communities."
"The PDF describes a malware campaign called Operation In(ter)ception by the Mac-focused threat actor group Lazarus that was discovered on August 16, 2022.The attack used a signed executable disguised as a job description for cryptocurrency firm Coinbase to upload to VirusTotal from Brazil and Singapore.The malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon and drops three files: a decoy PDF, a bundle FinderFontsUpdater.app, and a downloader safarifontagent.app.The bundle is signed with a certificate issued in February 2022 to a developer named Shankey Nohria and team identifier 264HFWQH63.The application is not notarized and Apple has revoked the certificate on August 12.Another change is in the downloader, safarifiontagent, as it connects to a different C&C server (url) and Apple did not respond at the time of analysis.The Windows counterpart of this threat dropping the exact same decoy (2B4E8F1927927BDC2F71914BA1F12511D9B6BDBDB2DF390E267F54DC 4F8919DD) was spotted on August 4.The decoy is ""Engineering Manager, Product Security"" job description at Coinbase.It is similar to the Windows counterpart but has a different icon and font.The PDF decoy and bundle version are the same as the Windows version.In summary, this is a Mac malware campaign by Lazarus that distributed signed malware disguised as job descriptions of cryptocurrency firms to infect systems, dropping decoy documents and downloading malware.The operationally.The campaign shows Lazarus continues to target the Mac and Windows.","ESET researchers discovered a new malware campaign targeting Mac users that is attributed to the Lazarus threat group.On August 16, 2022, ESET announced on Twitter that a signed Mac executable disguised as a Coinbase job description was uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil.This is similar to a campaign ESET uncovered in May 2022 originating from Singapore.The malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures.It drops three files: a PDF job description decoy, a bundle called FinderFontsUpdater.app, and a downloader called safarifontagent.The bundle is signed with a certificate issued in February 2022 that Apple revoked on August 12, 2022.Unlike the May campaign, this version connects to a different command and control server at concrecapital[.]com.The server did not respond when analyzed.On August 4, 2022, another security researcher found a Windows version dropping the same PDF and connecting to a different C2.ESET believes this new activity is part of Lazarus' Operation In(ter)ception campaign targeting Mac users.The malware bypasses security products by disguising itself as a legitimate job application.The use of code signing and targeting of cryptocurrency companies indicates the likely purpose is cyberespionage and financial theft.ESET provided hashes for the dropped files and C2 domain to help identify infections.They assess this demonstrates Lazarus' continued efforts to breach MacOS devices through social engineering and Trojanized applications."
"The PDF describes research by Talos on malware campaigns attributed to advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, based on analysis of the Anubis and Talos malware sandboxes.Anubis is an automated threat analysis system used by security firms to analyze malware samples submitted to their platforms.Talos examined samples from the Talos and Cisco Anti-Malware Protection (AMP) datasets, which contain samples from over 100 anti-malware and research companies.Some malware samples were found that had been submitted to Anubis months or years prior to being officially attributed to APT groups.The APT campaigns lasted 458 days before detection, suggesting the malware authors were actively developing the malware months prior to submitting it for analysis.Analysis of an APT campaign sample submitted to VirusTotal revealed possible links to the Cisco AMP malware and telemetry used by Cisco for AMP protection.In summary, the PDF provides an in-depth look at 10 sophisticated APT malware campaigns from 2010-2015, some of which gained media attention when publicly disclosed.The campaigns involved sophisticated malware, some with ties to state-sponsored groups, others to cyber criminals or others to espionage groups.While attribution is difficult, Talos was able to connect the dots between some samples and legitimate malware by comparing them to other malware samples in their sandbox and Cisco's AMP telemetry.The research aims to raise awareness of the challenges of attributing malware campaigns to specific threat actors.","The PDF is a blog post by Cisco Talos describing their analysis of past APT malware campaigns in their threat intelligence datasets.They looked at 10 major APT campaigns made public between 2010-2015, including campaigns like Aurora, Equation, Red October etc.Attribution is not discussed.They searched for these malware samples in the Talos malware zoo (feeds from AV companies, researchers etc.)and found samples for most campaigns existed in their zoo months or years before public disclosure of the APT campaigns.On average, it took 458 days after initial detection for samples to be publicly tied to an APT campaign.The gap was as high as 3 years for Equation samples.Analysis of VirusTotal submitters showed certain entities had submitted samples from multiple campaigns, indicating possible links between campaigns or actors.In the Cisco AMP customer telemetry, they found pre-dated samples related to 3 campaigns.Most were detected as malicious when first seen, but some evaded initial detection.The post concludes that while detection happens quickly, connecting samples to campaigns takes longer due to high volumes of generic malware.Sandbox evasion also delays detection.Their findings validate that threat actors submit samples to test defenses prior to attacks.Better analytics are needed to identify and correlate samples early to discover stealthy campaigns in progress."

"The PDF discusses malware samples and tactics used in watering hole attacks attributed to the Lazarus cybercrime group to spoof the origin of the attacks.The attacks targeted financial regulator websites and banks to flood them with exploits to install remote access trojans and shellcode.Analysis of the malware samples shows they use a technique called ""false flag malware"" where they use Russian words to indicate the state of the attack or issue commands to maintain communication with a command and control (C2) server.This allows the attack to appear legitimate but be misattributed.The malware uses a variety of techniques to avoid detection, including using exploits, obfuscated C2 communications, and injecting malicious DLLs into legitimate processes like lsass.exe.The analysis examines the malware's encryption, C2 communication protocol, and other technical details.It also examines the watering hole exploit code used to deploy the malware and how it leverages Russian words in its C2 traffic to obscure its origins.The report aims to shed light on the attack tactics, techniques, and procedures to help defenders detect and defend against this threat actor's tactics.It provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, network IOCs, and MITRE ATT&CK mappings associated with this campaign.Recommendations are provided for detection and prevention.","The document analyzes malware used in watering hole attacks on financial institutions attributed to the Lazarus cybercrime group.The malware uses false flags and misleading translations to disguise its origin and evade detection.The attacks start by compromising websites to serve exploits that download malware.The malware stages use encoded shellcode and downloading of components to complicate analysis.Decoding reveals loosely translated Russian words likely meant to mislead investigators into thinking the malware is from Russia.The multi-stage process ultimately leads to execution of unknown final payloads on target systems.The false flags and evolving techniques aim to avoid detection, but in-depth analysis enables attribution and highlights the need for continued monitoring of Lazarus campaigns.Defensive recommendations include implementing provided indicators of compromise."
"The document analyzes two waves of cyberattacks targeting the Albanian government e-services that used ransomware and wiper malware signed with stolen code signing certificates.The first wave struck in July 2022, affecting TIMS, ADAM, and MEMEX e- services, and the second wave in September 2022 targeted law enforcement systems, using the same attack tactics but with modifications to evade detection and evasion.Analysis of the wave 2 ransomware samples shows significant differences in the use of CreateFile, WriteFile APIs, and RC4 encryption schemes compared to the ransomware used in both waves.The ROADSWEEP ransomware encrypts files and installs itself as a raw disk driver, providing direct disk access inside the malware itself.The attackers used stolen certificates from Nvidia and Kuwait Telecommunications to sign the malware.The second wave ransomware checks for valid arguments before executing, while the first wave did not.This indicates the initial infection occurred through driver installation only, likely to avoid security controls.The malware uses the AnyDesk remote access tool, suggesting cooperation between different attack groups.There is also talk of Persian-speaking hackers using an account at another Albanian entity to deploy ransomware/wiper malware, suggesting potential collaboration with the threat actor behind Shamoon wiper attacks in the Middle East.Defenders are advised to monitor for signs of this activity and patch systems immediately.","The cybercriminal group Lazarus has been conducting cyberattacks against Albanian government entities in two waves, using ransomware and data-wiping malware signed with stolen certificates.The first wave occurred in July 2022, impacting Albanian e-services.The second wave started in September, targeting critical law enforcement systems with similar malware but modified for detection evasion.Wave 2 ransomware samples share similarities with wave 1, including the use of CreateFile and WriteFile APIs for file overwrites and RC4 encryption algorithm.The ransomware in both waves is based on ROADSWEEP, uses stolen certificates to appear legitimate, and encrypts files in an unrecoverable way, rendering a ransom demand ineffective.The wiper malware embeds a raw disk driver for direct access to wipe data quickly.In the second wave, the attackers used a leaked Nvidia code signing certificate to sign the wiper and embedded the disk driver within the malware for automated execution post-installation.They also modified messaging and encryption keys to evade security controls.Underground posts suggest the attackers may have used AnyDesk for initial access.Different attack groups speaking Persian and another language appear to be cooperating in the campaign.The malware contains political messaging reflecting tensions between Albania and Iran.The targeting of law enforcement and modifications for speed align with prior devastating Shamoon wiper attacks in the Middle East.Defenders are advised to monitor for suspicious certificates and remote access software to detect potential intrusions.The publication provides indicators of compromise and detection details for the malware."
"The document describes a threat actor called Blue Mockingbird that is deploying Monero cryptocurrency-mining payloads on Windows machines at multiple organizations.They achieve initial access by exploiting the CVE-2019-18935 Telerik UI vulnerability in ASP.NET web applications.This allows the attacker to escalate the privileges of a DCOM class in IIS Application Pool Identity (IISP) to gain impersonate privilege.The escalation happens via process injection using dynamic link libraries (DLLs) containing XMRIG, a Monero miner DLL.The miner sends the payload to the attacker's command and control server.The attacker then uses various techniques like proxying, reverse shell, proxy, secure socket funneling, and SSF shell to establish persistence, including using COR_PROFILER to persist in memory, and registering domains impersonating commonly used Monero-mining domains.The binary payloads are compiled from a baseline configuration and scheduled into scheduled tasks.Once executed, the miner collects system info and sends it to a command server to receive further instructions.The threat actor uses reverse shell payloads, proxy tools, and other techniques to maintain persistence on compromised systems.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, domain names, and MITRE ATT&CK techniques to detect this threat.It also covers detection strategies like blocking scheduled tasks, monitoring for suspicious DLL loading, and monitoring IIS activity.","The document describes a threat actor called Blue Mockingbird that has been deploying Monero cryptocurrency mining malware on Windows machines across multiple organizations.Blue Mockingbird gains initial access by exploiting the CVE-2019-18935 vulnerability in Telerik UI web applications.The attacker leverages the privileges of a DCOM class and IIS Application Pool Identity's SeImpersonate privilege to perform the escalation.Once in, they use various techniques like process injection, DLL sideloading, and privilege escalation to deploy and persist a malicious Monero miner built on XMRig.The miner payload communicates with external mining pools to mine Monero.Blue Mockingbird uses lateral movement techniques like RDP and Windows admin shares to distribute the payload across the network.Blue Mockingbird appears to experiment with different tools, such as Fast Reverse Proxy (frp), Secure Socket Funneling (SSF), and Venom, to pivot between systems.They have also experimented with different reverse shell and proxy tools for command and control.Persistence mechanisms involve hijacking services like wercplsupport using COR_PROFILER COM hijacking.The malware compiles each payload with a list of commonly used Monero-mining domains and a wallet address, which can be extracted from the binary or observed in network traffic.Red Canary provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, Monero wallet addresses, and analytics to detect the miner payloads, privilege escalation, and lateral movement.They also advise patching public-facing apps and establishing a baseline of normal scheduled tasks.In summary, the document analyzes a sophisticated, evolving threat actor distributing stealthy cryptocurrency miners using multiple intrusion techniques across victim networks."
