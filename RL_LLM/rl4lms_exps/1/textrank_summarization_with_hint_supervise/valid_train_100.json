The P2P network includes a downloader, signed driver, and node tool that communicate via UDP. The node tool exchanges records between peers. The programming style matches that of the GraceRAT malware used by TA505. The downloader fetches the other components from a command and control server, decrypts them, and installs them. The signed driver filters system information to avoid detection, injects the node tool payload, and reports back to the C2. The node tool communicates with other peers to exchange records containing metadata and encrypted payloads. The records appear to be used to distribute updates.

OceanLotus is an advanced and sophisticated piece of malware that has improved over previous versions in several ways: It uses a decoy Word document to disguise itself when executed. This tricks the user into thinking they opened a normal document. It establishes persistence in a clever way, storing itself in locations that mimic real MacOS applications and processes. This helps it blend in and avoid detection. It does not use suspicious command line utilities, making static analysis more difficult. It uses a custom encrypted network protocol to communicate with its command and control server, not standard web protocols. The encryption keys change per session. It can receive additional modules from the server, expanding its functionality dynamically. It exfiltrates system information from the infected machine back to the server, including username, network information, model details, etc. The authors appear to be espionage motivated and targeting MacOS specifically as it becomes more widely used.

Winnti has been active since at least 2012 conducting supply chain attacks against the video game and software industries. Skip-2.0 allows the attacker to stealthily connect to any MSSQL account using a hardcoded magic password. It achieves this by installing hooks in the sqllang.dll library used by MSSQL Server to bypass authentication and disable logging of the unauthorized access. The malware uses the same VMProtected launcher, custom packer, and injector techniques seen in other Winnti tools like PortReuse and ShadowPad. An injector called Inner-Loader injects the skip-2.0 DLL into the sqlserv.exe process. Skip-2.0 locates and hooks functions in sqllang.dll related to password validation, logging, and auditing using pattern matching. If the magic password is provided, the hooks spoof validation and disable logging. This gives Winnti stealthy persistence and access to manipulate or steal data from compromised MSSQL Servers. Skip-2.0 was found to be effective against MSSQL Server versions 11 and 12.

CryWiper was first discovered by Kaspersky in fall 2022 being used against a Russian entity. CryWiper masquerades as ransomware but is actually designed to permanently destroy data beyond recovery. It creates scheduled tasks to repeatedly run on compromised systems. It contacts a command and control server which can remotely activate the wiping process. CryWiper stops critical database and email services, deletes shadow copies, and modifies the registry to prevent remote access. It then corrupts files on the system while skipping certain directories and file types to avoid fully disabling the computer. After wiping files, it generates a fake ransom note demanding payment in Bitcoin to decrypt files, even though restoration is not possible. The wiping uses an algorithm called Mersenne Twister, distinct from other 2022 wipers like IsaacWiper.

Researchers discovered a trojanized DeFi wallet app compiled in November 2021 that implants a backdoor when executed. The backdoor allows full control of the compromised system. The infection starts with a trojanized installer that drops the next-stage backdoor and a legitimate DeFi wallet app. It launches the backdoor, overwriting itself with the legitimate app to cover its tracks. The backdoor disguises itself as Google Chrome and connects to command and control servers, receiving directives to gather system info, download files, and control the victim's machine. The Trojanized application gets removed from the disk, allowing it to cover its tracks. The malware uses encrypted HTTP requests to communicate with multistage command servers hosted on compromised South Korean websites.

The malware ecosystem enables persistent administrative access to the hypervisor, command execution on guest VMs, file transfers between the hypervisor and VMs, tampering with logs, and executing commands between VMs on the same hypervisor. The malware was initially detected when commands were seen coming from the vmtoolsd process on a Windows VM hosted on an ESXi hypervisor. Analysis of the ESXi boot profiles revealed malicious VIBs (vSphere Installation Bundles) being used to deploy backdoors called VIRTUALPITA and VIRTUALPIE on the hypervisors after reboot. The VIBs were signed as PartnerSupported though they were actually CommunitySupported, allowing installation with the --force flag. VIRTUALPITA creates a listener on the hypervisor for arbitrary command execution, file transfers, and starting\/stopping logging. VIRTUALPIE is a Python backdoor with similar capabilities. Commands executed on the hypervisor are sent to guest VMs via vmtoolsd.exe for execution. This was used for file enumeration, compression, and credential dumping. VARIUALPITA samples were also found on Linux vCenter systems masquerading as a legitimate process. Windows VMs hosted on the compromised hypervisors contained VIRTUALGATE, a utility that uses VMCI sockets to run commands on guest VMs from the hypervisor.

Sofacy has targeted military and government entities since around 2008, with a focus on NATO countries. Sofacy has continuously expanded its arsenal of custom malware like CORESHELL, SPLM, JHUHUGIT, and AZZY. In 2015, the group was observed using zero-day exploits and a modified version of AZZY for widespread attacks on defense contractors. The attacks involve multi-stage malware with resilience via multiple backdoors on compromised systems. Every 10 minutes, the backdoor sends a new request to the server, which is expected to send back executable code and one of the following commands: a. Write a new file _%LOCAL_APPDATA%\\dllhost.exe_ or _%TEMP%\\dllhost.exe_ and execute it, then delete the file b. Write a new file _%LOCAL_APPDATA%sechost.dll_ or _%TEMP%\\sechost.dll_ and call its first exported function using __undll32.exe_ or Windows API, then delete the file c. Run shellcode provided by the server in a new thread While processing the commands, the backdoor logs all errors and execution results. It also reads the contents of the file _%APPDATA%\\chkdbg.log_ and appends it to the results before sending them to the C2 server. The module aborts the thread receiving C2 command after it fails to correctly execute commands more than six times in a row, i.e. if file or process creation fails. Sofacy has also developed USB data theft tools to exfiltrate data from air-gapped networks. Infrastructure analysis has revealed Sofacy's preferred hosting providers, command and control servers, and use of encryption and code obfuscation to avoid detections. The group frequently recompiles versions of its malware to bypass antivirus signatures. Sofacy is noted for its speed of attacks and innovation in malware and infrastructure. The report highlights the need for a multi-layered defense including traditional antivirus, patching, whitelisting, and monitoring to guard against the group's tactics. Overall, the report profiles Sofacy's capabilities, tools, infrastructure, and targeting, warning that the highly active group continues to enhance its arsenal despite takedowns of previous versions. Constant vigilance and an adaptive defense posture are required against the adaptable threat.

Run shellcode provided by the server in a new thread While processing the commands, the backdoor logs all errors and execution results.It also reads the contents of the file _%APPDATA%\\chkdbg.log_ and appends it to the results before sending them to the C2 server.The module aborts the thread receiving C2 command after it fails to correctly execute commands more than six times in a row, i.e.if file or process creation fails.Sofacy has also developed USB data theft tools to exfiltrate data from air-gapped networks.Infrastructure analysis has revealed Sofacy's preferred hosting providers, command and control servers, and use of encryption and code obfuscation to avoid detections.The group frequently recompiles versions of its malware to bypass antivirus signatures.Sofacy is noted for its speed of attacks and innovation in malware and infrastructure.The report highlights the need for a multi-layered defense including traditional antivirus, patching, whitelisting, and monitoring to guard against the group's tactics.Overall, the report profiles Sofacy's capabilities, tools, infrastructure, and targeting, warning that the highly","Unnamed: 4":null,"Unnamed: 5":null}]
