"The PDF describes analysis of a sophisticated malware called Raspberry Robin that uses multiple layers of obfuscation to evade detection.Roshtyak is packed in as many as 14 protective layers, each serving a specific purpose.The obfuscation allows the malware to maintain persistence and escalate privileges.In addition to obfuscation, Raspberry Robin uses various techniques to evade analysis and analysis, such as exploiting known vulnerabilities, injecting itself into processes on demand, using PsExec instead of PsExec, hiding URLs, and hiding ROP and ROP payloads on Tor with a random name.The payload is a self-extracting package that installs a tool called iexpress on Windows systems.It gathers system information and sends it to a command and control server.The fake payload uses control flow flattening and hardcoded activation keys to obscure its purpose.It crashes after entering an infinite loop to avoid detection.The malware also uses adware to hide the fake payload.The analysis shows how the combination of heavy obfuscation and numerous advanced anti-analysis tricks allow Raspberry Robin to avoid scrutiny and analysis.The PDF aims to help fellow researchers recognize and respond to similar tricks used by this sophisticated malware strain.","The PDF discusses the malware Raspberry Robin, specifically focusing on its heavily protected DLL backdoor called Roshtyak.Roshtyak employs numerous advanced anti-analysis techniques to avoid detection, including anti-debugger, anti-sandbox, anti-VM, and anti-emulation checks.If any check succeeds in detecting the analysis environment, Roshtyak will terminate itself, crash intentionally, enter an infinite loop, or execute fake adware payload.The fake payload tricks analysts into thinking the malware is harmless.Roshtyak's code is heavily obfuscated through control flow flattening, function activation keys, variable masking, and other techniques.It is packed in up to 14 layers, each serving a specific protective purpose.The obfuscation hinders static analysis.The core functionality of Roshtyak is to establish persistence, escalate privileges, move laterally, and download additional payloads.The malware uses encrypted kernel exploits to escalate privileges, which are decrypted on demand.Roshtyak downloads PsExec on demand from a specific URL and drops it into a temporary directory under a random name.The payload to be executed by PsExec is a self-extracting package created by a tool called IExpress, which is an ancient Windows installer.It profiles victims by collecting system information and exfiltrating it to C2 servers over Tor.The servers can respond with new shellcode for execution.Reverse engineering Roshtyak is very challenging due to the combination of heavy obfuscation and numerous advanced anti-analysis tricks.The PDF aims to help fellow researchers recognize and respond to similar malware tricks, and harden analysis environments against the described evasion techniques."
"The document analyzes a cyberespionage campaign by a threat actor group called UNC4191 targeting targeted organizations in Southeast Asia and Europe.Mandiant assesses the threat actor has a China nexus and has been active since at least 2021.Initial infection starts by compromising USB devices and installing malware on removable drives.Successful compromise led to the installation of legitimate signed binaries that provided backdoor access and data exfiltration capabilities.The malware includes launchers like MISTCLOAK, DARKDEW, BLUEHAZE, and a DarkDEW dropper capable of infecting removable drives and collecting data from air-gapped systems.A signed binary drops a reverse shell that connects to a hardcoded command and control server to receive commands like uploading/downloading files, creating backdoors, and tunneling traffic to evade network controls.A renamed version of the Nmap networking tool NCAT is also deployed.After successful compromise, the malware self-replicates to infect more systems and collect additional data.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, domains, IP addresses, and YARA rules to detect this activity.In response, Mandiant developed new real-time threat hunting capabilities to detect the malware and respond quickly to changes in tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by this group.In summary, the report provides an overview of the latest malware tools and tactics used by the China-linked threat actor UNC2191, as well as an analysis of their tactics, infrastructure, tools, and motivations.","The PDF describes a cyberespionage campaign called UNC4191 that targeted organizations primarily in Southeast Asia, as well as some in the US, Europe, and Asia Pacific.The threat actor has a suspected China nexus.Initial infection vectored used USB devices.Malicious binaries named USB Drive.exe or Removable Drive.exe were executed by users when plugging in compromised USB drives.The binaries sideloaded and executed the malware MISTCLOAK, DARKDEW, and BLUEHAZE.MISTCLOAK decrypts and executes DARKDEW from an encrypted file on the USB drive.DARKDEW self-replicates by infecting any new USB drives plugged into the compromised system.It steals data from air-gapped systems this way.BLUEHAZE uses a signed binary to sideload itself.It opens a reverse shell to a command and control server using NCAT.Successful compromise allows the threat actor to maintain persistent access and carry out intelligence collection.The campaign appears to have started around September 2021 based on compile timestamps of the malware samples.New detections were created in Managed Defense to identify this activity, enabling rapid response.Indicators of compromise are provided.Mandiant will continue monitoring the campaign and provide updates on changes in TTPs or new tools."

"Mandiant investigated a novel malware ecosystem impacting VMware ESXi and ESXi hypervisors that enables a threat actor to maintain persistent administrative access to the hypervisor.The malware allows the attacker to send commands to the guest VM running on ESXi to execute commands sent by the ESXi host.When ESXi boot files are loaded, the malware installs malicious vSphere Installation Bundles (VIBs) to maintain persistence across ESXi.Mandiant identified two new malware families named VIRTUALPITA and VIRATALPIE that were installed using the VIBs.VIB packages are vendor-specific files that are installed by partners to ensure ESXi hosts are partner supported or community supported.They contain metadata like the --force flag, VIB payload, and a listener for arbitrary command execution.The VIB malware uses Python scripts with similar capabilities as the legitimate VMware Tools process vmtoolsd.exe.It has anti-analysis and compression features.Samples were found on Linux vCenter systems as well.The main malware families detected are VIRTALGATE on Linux servers and VMCI on Windows servers.The Chinese threat actor behind the malware is believed to be state-sponsored and targeting organizations in China.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, domains, IP addresses, and hashes associated with the malware.It demonstrates the evolution of malware targeting ESXi environments and the need for threat hunting to uncover novel evasion techniques.","The PDF document from Mandiant details the investigation of novel malware being deployed on VMware ESXi hypervisors by a threat actor tracked as UNC3886.The malware ecosystem enables persistent administrative access to the hypervisor, command execution on guest VMs, file transfers between the hypervisor and VMs, tampering with logs, and executing commands between VMs on the same hypervisor.The malware was initially detected when commands were seen coming from the vmtoolsd process on a Windows VM hosted on an ESXi hypervisor.Analysis of the ESXi boot profiles revealed malicious VIBs (vSphere Installation Bundles) being used to deploy backdoors called VIRTUALPITA and VIRTUALPIE on the hypervisors after reboot.The VIBs were signed as PartnerSupported though they were actually CommunitySupported, allowing installation with the --force flag.VIRTUALPITA creates a listener on the hypervisor for arbitrary command execution, file transfers, and starting/stopping logging.VIRTUALPIE is a Python backdoor with similar capabilities.Commands executed on the hypervisor are sent to guest VMs via vmtoolsd.exe for execution.This was used for file enumeration, compression, and credential dumping.VARIUALPITA samples were also found on Linux vCenter systems masquerading as a legitimate process.Windows VMs hosted on the compromised hypervisors contained VIRTUALGATE, a utility that uses VMCI sockets to run commands on guest VMs from the hypervisor.Based on the nature of the intrusions, Mandiant assesses UNC3886 has a likely China nexus and espionage motivations.Indicators of compromise, Yara rules, and recommendations for hardening ESXi/vSphere environments are provided."
"The document analyzes the activities of the Fin7 cybercrime group, which uses a technique called ""BadUSB"" attacks to spread malware via trojanized USB devices masquerading as keyboards.FIN7 used an Arduino sketch file called ""sketch_jul31a.ino"" to infect USB devices pretending to be keyboards with keystroke injection malware.The sketch executes a hidden PowerShell script that installs the IceBot remote access trojan (RAT) on infected devices.Analysis of the IP address hosting the RAT revealed 9 IP addresses that host FIN7 command and control servers, one of which contains a control panel for managing infected systems.IceBot allows FIN7 to gain unauthorized remote access to infected systems and steal data.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, OS versions, and Yara rules to detect the attack.It also covers mitigation recommendations like disabling USB firewalls, monitoring the network for unusual USB traffic, encoding scripts and files, and monitoring for suspicious USB connections.The key points are that FIN7 abuses the Arduino platform to build malware-laden USB devices that mimic keyboards and inject keystrokes to infect systems, bypassing antivirus detection, and bypass defenses.They also use trojanizing USBs to infect clients with ransomware.In summary, the report provides an in-depth look at FIN7's tactics, tools, infrastructure, and procedures for spreading malware via USB devices and using the Arduino sketch to infect victims.It provides technical details on the attack flow, encryption, and capabilities.","The cybercrime group FIN7 has been using ""BadUSB"" attacks to spread malware.They distribute USB devices containing malicious Arduino sketches that act as keyboards.When plugged in, the sketch executes PowerShell to download and install the IceBot remote access trojan (RAT).This allows FIN7 to gain unauthorized access to target networks.Analysis of the sketch code shows it opens a hidden PowerShell window to download the trojan from IP addresses linked to FIN7.The RAT then connects to FIN7 command and control servers.A control panel was discovered showing systems infected with IceBot, including info like IP, OS, antivirus, and options to interact with the RAT.This attack method avoids firewalls and email filters by not transmitting malware over the network.Encoding and scripts minimize malware files for stealth.FIN7 recently created a fake security company potentially to construct trojanized USBs.They may be using unwitting admins or sending them to clients for social engineering.The USB-based attack represents an evolution in tactics for FIN7 to gain persistent access and evade protections as they expand into ransomware operations.Defenses should focus on physical media controls and monitoring for suspicious USB activities."
"The document describes a targeted cyberattack campaign called Operation GreedyWonk that compromised websites of foreign policy and national security organizations to redirect visitors to an exploit server hosting a Flash zero-day vulnerability.The Flash vulnerability, assigned CVE-2014-0502, allows unauthorized code execution when overwriting a Flash pointer.The goal appears to be to infect visitors to these websites, which focus on defense and public policy matters, for follow-on data theft.The exploit bypasses Windows' Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protections to bypass Windows XP, Windows 7, and out-of-date versions of Java and Microsoft Office 2007/2010.It also exploits vulnerabilities in Java 1.6 and HXDS.dll.The report provides technical analysis of the exploit, including its techniques for bypassing ASLR, anti-debugging, and other protections.It recommends mitigations like upgrading from Windows XP to Windows 7 and updating Microsoft Office 7/7.7, as well as patching the ASLR bypasses.The group behind this campaign appears to have sufficient resources and tradecraft overlap with previous activity outlined in a 2012 ShadowServer campaign.Their infrastructure and targeting align with previous ShadowServer activity, suggesting they are a credible threat actor.The actor behind this appears focused on long-term persistence and early access for data theft rather than just initial access to new malware families.","The document describes an attack campaign dubbed ""Operation GreedyWonk"" that was discovered in February 2014.The campaign involved compromising multiple websites related to economic policy, foreign affairs, and national security.Visitors to these compromised sites were redirected to an exploit server hosting a zero-day Flash exploit (CVE-2014-0502).The goal was to infect visitors, especially those interested in defense and public policy matters, with malware for follow-on data theft.The exploit bypassed Windows ASLR protections by targeting systems still running Windows XP or having outdated Java and Microsoft Office.Once the exploit succeeded, it installed a remote access trojan called PlugX/Kaba.This malware variant was compiled shortly before discovery, indicating it was specifically built for this campaign.Researchers believe GreedyWonk may be connected to an earlier 2012 campaign that used similar tradecraft and infrastructure.Malware samples from both campaigns connected to overlapping domains that previously resolved to the same IP addresses.The group behind the campaigns appears sufficiently resourced to access zero-days and remains a credible threat.The report highlights the actor's persistence in compromising policy and defense-related websites, early access to exploits, ability to re-compromise sites, and deployment of various malware families.This demonstrates an adversary with mature capabilities that continues to pose a threat through strategic web compromises to infect visitors from specific communities."
"The document analyzes a malware campaign dubbed Operation In(ter)ception by the threat actor group Lazarus for Mac.It was discovered on August 16, 2022.The malware is a signed executable disguised as a job description for cryptocurrency that was uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil.It shares code similarities with malware from a year ago that was also uploaded from Singapore.This malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon and drops three files: a decoy PDF, a bundle FinderFontsUpdater.app, and a downloader safarifontagent.app.The bundle is signed with a certificate issued in February 2022 but revoked on August 12.The downloader connects to a different C2 server and was spotted on August 4.The Windows version of this malware drops the exact same decoy decoy, but the Windows version is signed using a different certificate issued on July 21.In summary, this is a Mac malware campaign by Lazarus that uses a signed malware bundle and decoy documents to distribute malware to victims.The PDF decoy and downloader are part of a multi-stage attack campaign distributing malware to both Intel/Apple Silicon customers.","ESET researchers discovered a new malware campaign targeting Mac users that is attributed to the Lazarus threat group.On August 16, 2022, ESET announced on Twitter that a signed Mac executable disguised as a Coinbase job description was uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil.This is similar to a campaign ESET uncovered in May 2022 originating from Singapore.The malware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures.It drops three files: a PDF job description decoy, a bundle called FinderFontsUpdater.app, and a downloader called safarifontagent.The bundle is signed with a certificate issued in February 2022 that Apple revoked on August 12, 2022.Unlike the May campaign, this version connects to a different command and control server at concrecapital[.]com.The server did not respond when analyzed.On August 4, 2022, another security researcher found a Windows version dropping the same PDF and connecting to a different C2.ESET believes this new activity is part of Lazarus' Operation In(ter)ception campaign targeting Mac users.The malware bypasses security products by disguising itself as a legitimate job application.The use of code signing and targeting of cryptocurrency companies indicates the likely purpose is cyberespionage and financial theft.ESET provided hashes for the dropped files and C2 domain to help identify infections.They assess this demonstrates Lazarus' continued efforts to breach MacOS devices through social engineering and Trojanized applications."
"The document analyzes malware campaigns attributed to advanced persistent threat (APT) actors.It examines campaigns from 2015-2016 that were previously unknown to security firms.Attribution is difficult but some malware samples were found that had been submitted to the Talos sandbox before security companies had been able to attribute them to APT groups.Researchers were able to connect the dots between some samples that were submitted months before the proper APT campaigns were identified, while others were submitted years before that.The analysis shows that some of the most advanced malware samples in the past few years were submitted by malware authors directly interacting with Talos' sandbox during development.This suggests the malware authors were aware of the sandbox environment prior to public disclosure.The APT campaign timeline shows the campaigns were active for 458 days prior to detection by security firms, indicating the threat actors were well-resourced and able to operate undetected for months before attribution was made.The Talos sample library contains over 30M malware samples spanning 5.5 years.It was analyzed using VirusTotal to identify IP addresses that could be used for command and control.While attribution is difficult, there are possible links between the Cisco malware samples and the Cisco AMP user base based on telemetry.In summary, the document provides an in-depth look at the tactics, techniques, and procedures of 10 APT malware campaigns uncovered in 2015 and 2016.It highlights the challenges in attributing malware to specific threat actors, but the research shows researchers are making progress.","The PDF is a blog post by Cisco Talos describing their analysis of past APT malware campaigns in their threat intelligence datasets.They looked at 10 major APT campaigns made public between 2010-2015, including campaigns like Aurora, Equation, Red October etc.Attribution is not discussed.They searched for these malware samples in the Talos malware zoo (feeds from AV companies, researchers etc.)and found samples for most campaigns existed in their zoo months or years before public disclosure of the APT campaigns.On average, it took 458 days after initial detection for samples to be publicly tied to an APT campaign.The gap was as high as 3 years for Equation samples.Analysis of VirusTotal submitters showed certain entities had submitted samples from multiple campaigns, indicating possible links between campaigns or actors.In the Cisco AMP customer telemetry, they found pre-dated samples related to 3 campaigns.Most were detected as malicious when first seen, but some evaded initial detection.The post concludes that while detection happens quickly, connecting samples to campaigns takes longer due to high volumes of generic malware.Sandbox evasion also delays detection.Their findings validate that threat actors submit samples to test defenses prior to attacks.Better analytics are needed to identify and correlate samples early to discover stealthy campaigns in progress."

"The document analyzes malware samples linked to watering hole attacks against financial institutions attributed to the threat actor group Lazarus.The attacks were initially reported in 2016, but more recently more malware samples have emerged that use a ""false flag"" technique to spoof the origin of the attack.The malware uses exploits and shellcode to inject itself into legitimate processes like lsass.exe and explorer.exe.Analysis shows the malware uses several Russian words to indicate the state of its communication with a command and control (C2) server, indicating it is communicating with the C2 or using a backdoor.The C2 protocol uses a custom protocol to receive commands and exfiltrate data from the infected system.The report provides indicators of compromise like MD5 hashes, file hashes, and Yara rules to identify the malware.It also examines the watering hole exploit kit code used in the attacks, which uses obfuscation and obfuscation techniques similar to those used in previous Lazarus campaigns.The false flag technique allows the malware to misattribute the attack to a known Lazarus subgroup rather than directly attribute it to them.The analysis aims to shed light on the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by the Lazarus group to mislead defenders about the true origins of the attacks.Recommendations are provided for detection and prevention.","The document analyzes malware used in watering hole attacks on financial institutions attributed to the Lazarus cybercrime group.The malware uses false flags and misleading translations to disguise its origin and evade detection.The attacks start by compromising websites to serve exploits that download malware.The malware stages use encoded shellcode and downloading of components to complicate analysis.Decoding reveals loosely translated Russian words likely meant to mislead investigators into thinking the malware is from Russia.The multi-stage process ultimately leads to execution of unknown final payloads on target systems.The false flags and evolving techniques aim to avoid detection, but in-depth analysis enables attribution and highlights the need for continued monitoring of Lazarus campaigns.Defensive recommendations include implementing provided indicators of compromise."
"The document analyzes two waves of cyberattacks targeting Albanian government e-services that used stolen digital certificates to sign ransomware and wiper malware in the first wave in July 2022.The attacks targeted government e services, with the second wave in September 2022 also targeting critical law enforcement systems.The second wave of attacks had some changes that likely allowed evasion, including embedding a raw disk driver in the malware, modifying metadata, and using leaked code signing certificates from Nvidia and Kuwait Telecommunications to sign the malware.The malware checks for valid arguments before execution and mutexes after installation to evade security controls.It also uses the AnyDesk remote access tool to gain initial access.The attackers and access provider seemed to belong to different attack groups and spoke different languages, suggesting possible cooperation between different threat actors.There was underground chatter about Persian-speaking hackers using stolen certificates from a government entity to sign malware, possibly to deploy ransomware or wiperware.The changes in second wave malware in comparison to first wave ransomware are reminiscent of Shamoon wiper attacks in the Middle East.Defenders are advised to monitor for indicators of compromise like file hashes, network IOCs, and Yara rules associated with this activity.In summary, the document provides an in-depth look at the evolution of the ransomware/wiper malware used in both waves, its links to known threats like ROADSWEEP and ZEROCLEARE, as well as connections between the two waves.It provides technical analysis of the modifications made to the second-stage malware in terms of encryption, encryption schemes, metadata, command handling, and use of leaked digital certificates.","The cybercriminal group Lazarus has been conducting cyberattacks against Albanian government entities in two waves, using ransomware and data-wiping malware signed with stolen certificates.The first wave occurred in July 2022, impacting Albanian e-services.The second wave started in September, targeting critical law enforcement systems with similar malware but modified for detection evasion.Wave 2 ransomware samples share similarities with wave 1, including the use of CreateFile and WriteFile APIs for file overwrites and RC4 encryption algorithm.The ransomware in both waves is based on ROADSWEEP, uses stolen certificates to appear legitimate, and encrypts files in an unrecoverable way, rendering a ransom demand ineffective.The wiper malware embeds a raw disk driver for direct access to wipe data quickly.In the second wave, the attackers used a leaked Nvidia code signing certificate to sign the wiper and embedded the disk driver within the malware for automated execution post-installation.They also modified messaging and encryption keys to evade security controls.Underground posts suggest the attackers may have used AnyDesk for initial access.Different attack groups speaking Persian and another language appear to be cooperating in the campaign.The malware contains political messaging reflecting tensions between Albania and Iran.The targeting of law enforcement and modifications for speed align with prior devastating Shamoon wiper attacks in the Middle East.Defenders are advised to monitor for suspicious certificates and remote access software to detect potential intrusions.The publication provides indicators of compromise and detection details for the malware."
"The document describes activity by a threat actor called Blue Mockingbird that is deploying Monero cryptocurrency mining payloads on Windows machines at multiple organizations.The attackers gain initial access by exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2019-18935) in Telerik UI web applications running on Windows IIS servers.This allows the attackers to escalate the privileges of a DCOM class in IIS Application Pool Identity to achieve impersonate privilege escalation.The escalation happens through process injection using dynamic link DLL (DLL) hijacking techniques like DLL Privilege Escalation Manager and XMRIG.The miner payload is packaged as a DLL and exfiltrated to the attacker's command and control server.The attacker uses multiple techniques for persistence, including uploading DLLs to the COR_PROFILER module, proxying to commonly used Monero-mining domains, hiding the binary, and injecting payloads into scheduled tasks.The report provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, domain names, and IP addresses associated with this activity.It also covers detection strategies for process injection like proxy, secure socket funneling, and SSF.The malware uses a custom obfuscation technique called Venom to hide its C2 communications and payloads from view.Recommendations include patching the issue, monitoring for suspicious process injection, segmenting web applications, and using threat intelligence to detect related activity.In summary, the document provides an overview of a new Monero mining threat actor named Blue Mocktailoring its tools and techniques to exploit a Windows vulnerability to mine cryptocurrency.","The document describes a threat actor called Blue Mockingbird that has been deploying Monero cryptocurrency mining malware on Windows machines across multiple organizations.Blue Mockingbird gains initial access by exploiting the CVE-2019-18935 vulnerability in Telerik UI web applications.The attacker leverages the privileges of a DCOM class and IIS Application Pool Identity's SeImpersonate privilege to perform the escalation.Once in, they use various techniques like process injection, DLL sideloading, and privilege escalation to deploy and persist a malicious Monero miner built on XMRig.The miner payload communicates with external mining pools to mine Monero.Blue Mockingbird uses lateral movement techniques like RDP and Windows admin shares to distribute the payload across the network.Blue Mockingbird appears to experiment with different tools, such as Fast Reverse Proxy (frp), Secure Socket Funneling (SSF), and Venom, to pivot between systems.They have also experimented with different reverse shell and proxy tools for command and control.Persistence mechanisms involve hijacking services like wercplsupport using COR_PROFILER COM hijacking.The malware compiles each payload with a list of commonly used Monero-mining domains and a wallet address, which can be extracted from the binary or observed in network traffic.Red Canary provides indicators of compromise like file hashes, Monero wallet addresses, and analytics to detect the miner payloads, privilege escalation, and lateral movement.They also advise patching public-facing apps and establishing a baseline of normal scheduled tasks.In summary, the document analyzes a sophisticated, evolving threat actor distributing stealthy cryptocurrency miners using multiple intrusion techniques across victim networks."
